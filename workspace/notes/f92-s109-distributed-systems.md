## Fallacies of distributed computing (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing
- Summary: The fallacies of distributed computing are a set of assertions made by L. Peter Deutsch and others at Sun Microsystems describing false assumptions that programmers new to distributed applications invariably make.

## Stub (distributed computing) (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stub_(distributed_computing)
- Summary: In distributed computing, a stub is a program that acts as a temporary replacement for a remote service or object. It allows the client application to access a service as if it were local, while hiding the details of the underlying network communication. This can simplify the development process, as the client application does not need to be aware of the complexities of distributed computing. Instead, it can rely on the stub to handle the remote communication, while providing a familiar interface for the developer to work with.

## Distributed Computing Environment (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Computing_Environment
- Summary: The Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) is a software system developed in the early 1990s from the work of the Open Software Foundation (OSF), a consortium founded in 1988 that included Apollo Computer, IBM, Digital Equipment Corporation, and others. The DCE supplies a framework and a toolkit for developing client/server applications. The framework includes:a remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism known as DCE/RPC a naming (directory) service a time service an authentication service a distributed file system (DFS) known as DCE/DFS

## Quorum (distributed computing) (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quorum_(distributed_computing)
- Summary: A quorum is the minimum number of votes that a distributed transaction has to obtain in order to be allowed to perform an operation in a distributed system. A quorum-based technique is implemented to enforce consistent operation in a distributed system.

## Parallel computing (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing
- Summary: Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing, but has gained broader interest due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.
