## Swarm intelligence (depth 0)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence
- Summary: Swarm intelligence (SI) is the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, natural or artificial. The concept is employed in work on artificial intelligence. The expression was introduced by Jing Wang and Gerardo Beni in 1989, in the context of cellular robotic systems.

## Swarm robotics (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_robotics
- Summary: Swarm robotics is the study of how to design independent systems of robots without centralized control. The emerging swarming behavior of robotic swarms is created through the interactions between individual robots and the environment. This idea emerged on the field of artificial swarm intelligence, as well as the studies of insects, ants and other fields in nature, where swarm behavior occurs.

## Particle swarm optimization (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization
- Summary: In computational science, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a population of candidate solutions with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem through interactions among a population of candidate solutions, dubbed particles, moving the particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae that adjust each particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its own best known position so far, and by the best known position in its topological neighborhood ; vectors are updated as better positions are found. This is expected to move the swarm toward good solutions.

## Swarm behaviour (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_behaviour
- Summary: Swarm behaviour, or swarming, is a collective behaviour exhibited by entities, particularly animals, of similar size which aggregate together, perhaps milling about the same spot or perhaps moving en masse or migrating in some direction. It is a highly interdisciplinary topic.

## List of metaphor-based metaheuristics (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metaphor-based_metaheuristics
- Summary: This is a chronologically ordered list of metaphor-based metaheuristics and swarm intelligence algorithms, sorted by decade of proposal.

## Computational intelligence (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_intelligence
- Summary: In computer science, computational intelligence (CI) refers to concepts, paradigms, algorithms and implementations of systems that are designed to show "intelligent" behavior in complex and changing environments. These systems are aimed at mastering complex tasks in a wide variety of technical or commercial areas and offer solutions that recognize and interpret patterns, control processes, support decision-making or autonomously manoeuvre vehicles or robots in unknown environments, among other things. These concepts and paradigms are characterized by the ability to learn or adapt to new situations, to generalize, to abstract, to discover and associate. Nature-analog or nature-inspired methods play a key role, such as in neuroevolution for computational Intelligence.
