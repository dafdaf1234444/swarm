## Swarm behaviour (depth 0)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_behaviour
- Summary: Swarm behaviour, or swarming, is a collective behaviour exhibited by entities, particularly animals, of similar size which aggregate together, perhaps milling about the same spot or perhaps moving en masse or migrating in some direction. It is a highly interdisciplinary topic.

## Particle swarm optimization (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization
- Summary: In computational science, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a population of candidate solutions with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem through interactions among a population of candidate solutions, dubbed particles, moving the particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae that adjust each particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its own best known position so far, and by the best known position in its topological neighborhood ; vectors are updated as better positions are found. This is expected to move the swarm toward good solutions.

## Flocking (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking
- Summary: Flocking is the behavior exhibited when a group of birds, called a flock, are foraging or in flight. Sheep and goats also exhibit flocking behavior. Flocking by birds and mammals is similar to schooling in fish and these are often studied together.

## Locust (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locust
- Summary: Locusts are various species of short-horned grasshoppers in the family Acrididae that have a swarming phase. These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances they become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits, becoming gregarious. No taxonomic distinction is made between locust and grasshopper species; the basis for the definition is whether a species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions; this has evolved independently in multiple lineages, comprising at least 18 genera in 5 different subfamilies.

## Swarming motility (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarming_motility
- Summary: Swarming motility is a rapid and coordinated translocation of a bacterial population across solid or semi-solid surfaces, and is an example of bacterial multicellularity and swarm behaviour. Swarming motility was first reported by Jorgen Henrichsen and has been mostly studied in genus Serratia, Salmonella, Aeromonas, Bacillus, Yersinia, Pseudomonas, Proteus, Vibrio and Escherichia.

## Swarm robotics (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_robotics
- Summary: Swarm robotics is the study of how to design independent systems of robots without centralized control. The emerging swarming behavior of robotic swarms is created through the interactions between individual robots and the environment. This idea emerged on the field of artificial swarm intelligence, as well as the studies of insects, ants and other fields in nature, where swarm behavior occurs.
