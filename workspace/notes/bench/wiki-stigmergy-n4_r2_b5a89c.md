## Stigmergy (depth 0)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy
- Summary: Stigmergy is a mechanism of indirect coordination, through the environment, between agents or actions. The principle is that the trace left in the environment by an individual action stimulates the performance of a succeeding action by the same or different agent. Agents that respond to traces in the environment receive positive fitness benefits, reinforcing the likelihood of these behaviors' becoming fixed within a population over time.

## Ant colony optimization algorithms (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms
- Summary: In computer science and operations research, the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems that can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. Artificial ants represent multi-agent methods inspired by the behavior of real ants. The pheromone-based communication of biological ants is often the predominant paradigm used. Combinations of artificial ants and local search algorithms have become a preferred method for numerous optimization tasks involving some sort of graph, e.g., vehicle routing and internet routing.

## Swarm behaviour (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_behaviour
- Summary: Swarm behaviour, or swarming, is a collective behaviour exhibited by entities, particularly animals, of similar size which aggregate together, perhaps milling about the same spot or perhaps moving en masse or migrating in some direction. It is a highly interdisciplinary topic.

## Ant mill (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_mill
- Summary: An ant mill is an observed phenomenon in which a group of army ants, separated from the main foraging party, lose the pheromone track and begin to follow one another, forming a continuously rotating circle. This circle is commonly known as a “death spiral” because the ants might eventually die of exhaustion. It has been reproduced in laboratories and in ant colony simulations.

## Termite-inspired robots (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termite-inspired_robots
- Summary: Termite-inspired robots or TERMES robots are biomimetic autonomous robots capable of building complex structures without a central controller. A prototype team of termite-inspired robots was demonstrated by Harvard University researchers in 2014, following four years of development. Their engineering was inspired by the complex mounds that termites build, and was accomplished by developing simple rules to allow the robots to navigate and move building blocks in their environment. By following these simple rules, the robots could construct complex structures through a process called stigmergy, without requiring constant human instruction or supervision.

## Leonel Moura (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonel_Moura
- Summary: Leonel Moura is a conceptual artist whose work shifted in the late 1990s from photo based work to Artificial Intelligence and Robotic art. Since then he has produced several Painting Robots and the Robotarium, a zoo for robots. RAP (2006) is a robot that makes drawings based on emergence and stigmergy, decides when the work is ready, and signs it, is displayed as a permanent installation at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
