## Exception handling (depth 0)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling
- Summary: In computing and computer programming, exception handling is the process of responding to the occurrence of exceptions – anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special processing – during the execution of a program. In general, an exception breaks the normal flow of execution and executes a pre-registered exception handler; the details of how this is done depend on whether it is a hardware or software exception and how the software exception is implemented.

## Exception handling (programming) (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling_(programming)
- Summary: In computer programming, several programming language mechanisms exist for exception handling. The term exception is typically used to denote a data structure storing information about an exceptional condition. One mechanism to transfer control, or raise an exception, is known as a throw; the exception is said to be thrown. Execution is transferred to a catch.

## Exception handling syntax (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling_syntax
- Summary: Exception handling syntax is the set of keywords and/or structures provided by a computer programming language to allow exception handling, which separates the handling of errors that arise during a program's operation from its ordinary processes. Syntax for exception handling varies between programming languages, partly to cover semantic differences but largely to fit into each language's overall syntactic structure. Some languages do not call the relevant concept "exception handling"; others may not have direct facilities for it, but can still provide means to implement it.

- Summary: The syntax of C++ is the set of rules defining how a C++ program is written and compiled.

## JavaScript (depth 1)
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript
- Summary: JavaScript (JS) is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995. As of 2025, the overwhelming majority of websites (98.9%) uses JavaScript for client side webpage behavior.
