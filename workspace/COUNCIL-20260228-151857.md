# Swarm Council Repair Memo
**Target**: swarm repair priorities: historian grounding, lane metadata gaps, untracked artifacts, WSL friction
**Timestamp**: 2026-02-28T15:18:57.649532
**Council**: skeptic, adversary, synthesizer, council-expert

## Perspectives
### skeptic
*Prompt*: What evidence is missing? What claims here are unsupported or overclaimed?

### adversary
*Prompt*: What is the worst-case outcome if we do nothing? What can go wrong with the proposed repair?

### synthesizer
*Prompt*: What cross-domain patterns apply here? What is the minimal common structure?

### council-expert
*Prompt*: What are the top 3 prioritized actions? Who owns each one?

## Vice Versa Loop Inventory
| Loop | Outbound | Inbound | Status |
|------|----------|---------|--------|
| competition | swarm→benchmark | benchmark→calibration | wired if F-COMP1 active |
| colony-peer | colony-A→signal | colony-B→signal-back | wired if SIGNALS.md present |
| human-relay | human→data | swarm→compressed-insight | wired if F133 partial |
| expert-extract | swarm→domain-help | expert→lesson-correction | broken — no mechanism |
| benchmark | swarm→forecast | ground-truth→Brier-score | wired via F-COMP1 L-406 |

## Synthesis
**Diagnosis**: Council deliberation on: swarm repair priorities: historian grounding, lane metadata gaps, untracked artifacts, WSL friction
**Agreement**: Multi-role review surfaced perspectives across skeptic/adversary/synthesizer axes.
**Open disputes**:
  - Adversary vs synthesizer: blast-radius vs cross-domain-compression on swarm repair priorities: historian grounding, lane metadata gaps, untracked artifacts, WSL friction
  - Reality-check needed: is this measured or inferred?

## Action Memo (prioritized)
1. **Verify diagnosis: measure current state of 'swarm repair priorities: historian grounding, lane metadata gaps, untracked artifacts, WSL friction' with a concrete metric** — owner: `reality-check-expert or current-node`
2. **Wire the highest-value broken vice-versa loop (see vice_versa_loops above)** — owner: `vice-versa-expert`
3. **Dispatch skeptic session to stress-test proposed repair for 'swarm repair priorities: historian grounding, lane metadata gaps, untracked artifacts, WSL friction'** — owner: `council-expert`
4. **Write lesson on council findings (max 20 lines) and update relevant frontier** — owner: `current-node`
