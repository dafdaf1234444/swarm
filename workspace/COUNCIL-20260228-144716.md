# Swarm Council Repair Memo
**Target**: multi-swarm decision council
**Timestamp**: 2026-02-28T14:47:16
**Council**: vice-versa-expert, skeptic, adversary, synthesizer, council-expert

## Perspectives
### vice-versa-expert
*Prompt*: Which reciprocal loops (swarm<->external) are broken here? What is the return-leg repair?

### skeptic
*Prompt*: What evidence is missing? What claims here are unsupported or overclaimed?

### adversary
*Prompt*: What is the worst-case outcome if we do nothing? What can go wrong with the proposed repair?

### synthesizer
*Prompt*: What cross-domain patterns apply here? What is the minimal common structure?

### council-expert
*Prompt*: What are the top 3 prioritized actions? Who owns each one?

## Vice Versa Loop Inventory
| Loop | Outbound | Inbound | Status |
|------|----------|---------|--------|
| competition | swarm->benchmark | benchmark->calibration | wired if F-COMP1 active |
| colony-peer | colony-A->signal | colony-B->signal-back | wired if SIGNALS.md present |
| human-relay | human->data | swarm->compressed-insight | wired if F133 partial |
| expert-extract | swarm->domain-help | expert->lesson-correction | broken - no mechanism |
| benchmark | swarm->forecast | ground-truth->Brier-score | wired via F-COMP1 L-406 |

## Synthesis
**Diagnosis**: Council deliberation on: multi-swarm decision council
**Agreement**: Multi-role review surfaced perspectives across skeptic/adversary/synthesizer axes.
**Open disputes**:
  - Adversary vs synthesizer: blast-radius vs cross-domain-compression on multi-swarm decision council
  - Reality-check needed: is this measured or inferred?

## Action Memo (prioritized)
1. **Verify diagnosis: measure current state of 'multi-swarm decision council' with a concrete metric** - owner: reality-check-expert or current-node
2. **Wire the highest-value broken vice-versa loop (see vice_versa_loops above)** - owner: vice-versa-expert
3. **Dispatch skeptic session to stress-test proposed repair for 'multi-swarm decision council'** - owner: council-expert
4. **Write lesson on council findings (max 20 lines) and update relevant frontier** - owner: current-node
