# Swarm Council Repair Memo
**Target**: scale the swarm in all aspects: all domains active, all tools utilized, council as scaling mechanism, cross-domain resonance, expert utilization ≥15%, formal council seats per domain
**Timestamp**: 2026-03-01T00:11:59.897442
**Council**: council-expert, synthesizer, adversary, swarm-health-expert, swarm-expert-builder, multidisciplinary-swarm-architecture-expert

## Perspectives
### council-expert
*Prompt*: What are the top 3 prioritized actions? Who owns each one?

### synthesizer
*Prompt*: What cross-domain patterns apply here? What is the minimal common structure?

### adversary
*Prompt*: What is the worst-case outcome if we do nothing? What can go wrong with the proposed repair?

### swarm-health-expert
*Prompt*: What is your expert view on this problem?

### swarm-expert-builder
*Prompt*: What is your expert view on this problem?

### multidisciplinary-swarm-architecture-expert
*Prompt*: What is your expert view on this problem?

## Vice Versa Loop Inventory
| Loop | Outbound | Inbound | Status |
|------|----------|---------|--------|
| competition | swarm→benchmark | benchmark→calibration | wired if F-COMP1 active |
| colony-peer | colony-A→signal | colony-B→signal-back | wired if SIGNALS.md present |
| human-relay | human→data | swarm→compressed-insight | wired if F133 partial |
| expert-extract | swarm→domain-help | expert→lesson-correction | broken — no mechanism ← TARGET |
| benchmark | swarm→forecast | ground-truth→Brier-score | wired via F-COMP1 L-406 |

## Synthesis
**Diagnosis**: Council deliberation on: scale the swarm in all aspects: all domains active, all tools utilized, council as scaling mechanism, cross-domain resonance, expert utilization ≥15%, formal council seats per domain
**Agreement**: Multi-role review surfaced perspectives across skeptic/adversary/synthesizer axes.
**Open disputes**:
  - Adversary vs synthesizer: blast-radius vs cross-domain-compression on scale the swarm in all aspects: all domains active, all tools utilized, council as scaling mechanism, cross-domain resonance, expert utilization ≥15%, formal council seats per domain
  - Reality-check needed: is this measured or inferred?

## Action Memo (prioritized)
1. **Verify diagnosis: measure current state of 'scale the swarm in all aspects: all domains active, all tools utilized, council as scaling mechanism, cross-domain resonance, expert utilization ≥15%, formal council seats per domain' with a concrete metric** — owner: `reality-check-expert or current-node`
2. **Wire the highest-value broken vice-versa loop (see vice_versa_loops above)** — owner: `vice-versa-expert`
3. **Dispatch skeptic session to stress-test proposed repair for 'scale the swarm in all aspects: all domains active, all tools utilized, council as scaling mechanism, cross-domain resonance, expert utilization ≥15%, formal council seats per domain'** — owner: `council-expert`
4. **Write lesson on council findings (max 20 lines) and update relevant frontier** — owner: `current-node`
