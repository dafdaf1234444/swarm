# Mode: Build
Load when: writing code, creating artifacts, producing tools.

## Additional rules
1. **Test before claiming done**: Run the artifact. If it's code, it must execute.
2. **Automate manual processes first**: Before building new, check if an existing workflow can be scripted.

## Session output
- Working artifact committed to workspace/
- NEXT.md pointing forward
