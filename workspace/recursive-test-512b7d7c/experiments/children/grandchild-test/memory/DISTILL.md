# Distillation Protocol

## Step 1: Filter
Ask: "If a future session loads only INDEX.md and this lesson, will they avoid my mistakes and reuse my insights?"

## Step 2: Extract (use TEMPLATE.md)
- **What happened** (3 lines): Context only.
- **What we learned** (3 lines): The transferable insight.
- **Rule extracted** (1-2 lines): "If X, then Y" format. Must be actionable.
- **Affected beliefs**: Which B-IDs does this touch?

## Step 3: Check
1. Is the rule specific enough to act on?
2. Does it duplicate an existing lesson?
3. Is confidence level honest?

## Step 4: Update INDEX.md and DEPS.md as needed.

## Correcting wrong lessons
Add `SUPERSEDED BY L-{N}` to original. Write correction with `CORRECTS L-{N}`. Never delete.
