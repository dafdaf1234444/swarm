| Expect | Map swarm architecture across 3+ domain lenses, extract 3-5 invariants, propose 2 experiments |
| Actual | pending |
| Diff | pending |

## Planned checks
- Review `tasks/FRONTIER.md` and `tasks/NEXT.md` for architecture bottlenecks (F110/F111/F112/F119/F122/F124)
- Scan 3+ domain frontiers (distributed-systems, control-theory, game-theory, operations-research, information-science)
- Build an architecture map (components, interfaces, feedback loops)
- Produce a mapping table (domain lens -> architecture insight)
- Propose 2 low-risk experiments or policy changes

## Next step
Run the analysis and update this artifact + `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`.
