# Info Collector Expert Report — S309
Date: 2026-02-28
Lane: L-S235-INFO-COLLECTOR
Check mode: verification
Status: complete

## Expectation
- Collect high-signal updates across `tasks/NEXT.md`, `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`, and `memory/HUMAN-SIGNALS.md` into a compact, traceable report.

## Actual
### tasks/NEXT.md (latest)
- S308: F-SEC1 Layer 1 bundle hash implemented; next steps include bulletin trust tiers, FM-10 guard, and dry-run verification.
- S308: autoswarm anxiety gate verified; optional dry-run remains.
- Meta: orient.ps1 timeout noted; consider `--brief` or Python fallback.

### tasks/SWARM-LANES.md (latest)
Active/priority lanes:
- SOC-001 ACTIVE (social-media/reddit sequencing; awaiting first post).
- COORD-S307 ACTIVE (competitions phase 2 dispatch).
- DOMEX-HS-S307 ACTIVE (human-systems colony follow-ons).
READY backlog persists across multiple expert lanes (garbage/info collector, tooler/generalizer/researcher, multiple DOMEX domain lanes).

### memory/HUMAN-SIGNALS.md (recent tail)
- Latest recorded signals through S307 emphasize external grounding (competitions) and belief/README audits.
- New signal this session: "swarm the swarm" → meta-level audit/coordination directive (apply swarm method to swarm operations).

### Maintenance/orient signals
- orient.ps1 NOTICE-only: 1 open HUMAN-QUEUE item (HQ-38) at start; closed this session. 17 anxiety-zone frontiers, 13 domain coverage gaps.

## Diff
Expectation met. Report updated to current state; highlights coordination backlog and HQ-38 resolution path.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Execute one READY lane (suggest L-S230-GARBAGE-EXPERT refresh or a DOMEX domain lane).
2. Optional: run autoswarm dry-run under bash/WSL to validate logs.
3. Consider a maintenance check to auto-close concurrency HQ items via the default live-state integration rule.

## Prior Report — S245
Date: 2026-02-28
Lane: L-S235-INFO-COLLECTOR
Check mode: verification
Status: complete

## Expectation
- Collect high-signal updates across `tasks/NEXT.md`, `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`, and `memory/HUMAN-SIGNALS.md` into a compact, traceable report.

## Actual
### tasks/NEXT.md (latest)
- S239: F-QC5 bullshit-detector baseline executed; 12 verified / 8 unsupported (40% unsupported). Next: remediate numeric claims in README/FRONTIER and rerun.
- S239: Garbage-expert scan executed; 15 untracked artifacts, 24 modified tracked files; READY backlog persists.
- S239 meta-swarm: READY backlog persists; recommends lane compaction/activation.
- S239 next-steps note includes `L-S231-DANGER-EXPERT` even though SWARM-LANES shows it MERGED (stale next-step).

### tasks/SWARM-LANES.md (latest rows)
Active / blocked highlights:
- L-S196-ECON-COORD ACTIVE, blocked on HQ-15 (helper spawns decision).
- L-AI2-SYNC-S185 ACTIVE, next_step publish synthesis into FRONTIER/NEXT.
- DOMEX-PERSONALITY-S194 ACTIVE, needs F-PERS1 dispatch.
- DOMEX-EVO5-S195 ACTIVE, awaiting skeptic/structural analyst dispatch.
- L-S186-CTL2-STRUCTURED-TAGGING ACTIVE, next_step emit structured correction tags.

READY backlog highlights:
- S186 domain-expert lanes (AI, BRN, IS, STAT, OPS, GAM, EVO, CTL) still READY.
- L-S238-GENESIS-EXPERT READY (genesis template audit).

### memory/HUMAN-SIGNALS.md (recent)
- S238 "genesis expert swarm" -> genesis expert personality + lane.
- S235 "info collector expert ..." -> this lane created.
- S245 "swarm experts swarm" -> interpreted as execute an expert lane now; this report delivered.

## Diff
Expectation met. Report consolidates high-signal state and flags one stale NEXT step.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Remediate unsupported numeric claims (README + FRONTIER) and rerun F-QC5.
2. Execute one S186 DOMEX READY lane or L-S238-GENESIS-EXPERT.
3. Resolve HQ-15 to unblock economy helper spawns.
