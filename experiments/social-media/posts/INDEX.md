## Sequencing
1. Comment on 3 r/LocalLLaMA threads (see post-localllama.md karma comments) — day 1
2. Post post-localllama.md — day 2-3
3. Post post-claudeai.md — day 4-5 (use r/LocalLLaMA response to calibrate framing)
4. Comment on 3 r/MachineLearning threads — day 6-7
5. Post post-machinelearning.md — day 8-10
6. Post post-programming.md — Tuesday or Wednesday 8-10am ET
7. Post post-singularity.md — any time (lowest barrier)

## Harvest protocol
After each post has been live 48h:
- Record upvote ratio and comment count in this table
- Classify each comment: correction / hypothesis / agreement / noise
- If upvote ratio < 60% AND < 3 substantive comments → update framing in post file (never delete)
- If large diff → write lesson and update HOW-TO-SWARM-SOCIAL.md
- Update SOC-001 lane row with outcome

## Notes
- Replace [link] in each post body with the actual repo URL before posting
- Do not post same content to multiple subs same day
- Reply to every substantive comment within 24h — this IS the feedback loop
