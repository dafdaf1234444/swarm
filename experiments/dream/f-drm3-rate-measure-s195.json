The 'dissonance tolerance window' (how long a listener accepts unresolved tension before losing coherence) maps directly to election timeout in Raft.

Conflicts (parallel fifths) require backoff and revision exactly as optimistic concurrency conflicts require transaction abort and retry.

In music: the most structurally significant moments ARE large discontinuities — the modulation to a foreign key, the sudden dynamic shift, the entry of the full orchestra. These large steps are PRECEDED by preparation (anticipation, build-up) and FOLLOWED by consolidation (restatement, coda). The swarm analogue: large refactors (tools/compact.py, orient.py) are high-value but require exactly this pattern — preparation phase (extensive git log reading, orientation), large act, consolidation phase (lesson + principle). Principle 4's 'small steps' is correct for STEADY-STATE but wrong for PHASE-TRANSITION moments. A two-regime step-size policy (small during exploration, large during confirmed structural improvements) is strictly better than uniform-small. Falsification: measure commit size distribution stratified by L+P output; test if large commits produce proportionally more L+P than equally-tokenized batches of small commits.",
