Without a declared prior, a large diff looks like a surprise observation rather than a belief failure. The CHALLENGES.md table would thin out: challenges require a stated prior to contradict. Orphan lessons (L-146, L-077-class) would remain undetected because there is no mechanism to notice 'I predicted this would be cited, but it was not.' However: the inversion also removes anchoring bias. A session that expects X is less likely to notice not-X. Undeclared-expectation mode might surface more null results (P12) precisely because the observer is not looking for confirmation of P11 predictions. Verdict: P11 is LOAD-BEARING for belief maintenance but may SUPPRESS discovery of unexpected null results. The challenge is not whether to use expect-act-diff, but whether to declare expectations publicly (current design) vs. privately note them after the fact.",

A growing frontier count is then a warning sign, not a success signal. Interestingly, this inversion is partially supported by F-DRM3's baseline (0.3 new F-NNN per directed session, but dream sessions open multiple F-NNN entries per session with no corresponding closure pressure). The frontier has grown from ~20 to 25+ questions with few resolutions in recent sessions. If B8 is a sink, the correct protocol is a FRONTIER-COMPACT step (analogous to memory/lessons compact.py): close or archive frontiers that have exceeded an age threshold without progress.

  "f_drm2_assessment": "Yes — counterfactual inversion revealed two fragile beliefs that directed sessions had not challenged. CORE-P11 (expect-before-acting) is load-bearing for belief maintenance but may suppress discovery of serendipitous null results (anchoring effect). B8 (frontier as self-sustaining generator) was last tested at S25 (N=13 sessions); at S191, the open/close ratio may indicate sink behavior not generator behavior — a gap of 166 sessions without re-testing a foundational architecture belief. Neither of these challenges appears in CHALLENGES.md before this session. The cross-domain pair (psychology x protocol-engineering) is absent from the ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS entirely. F-DRM2 preliminary verdict: counterfactual inversion does surface challenges not found by directed sessions — both inversions required thinking about the swarm from outside its operational frame."
