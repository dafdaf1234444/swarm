  "method": "Build temporal citation DAG from Cites: headers in 609 lessons. For each citation event, record in-degree of target at citation time. Compute pool-normalized attachment rate rate(k) = attachments_at_k / pool_exposure_at_k. Fit log-log regression of rate vs k for k>=1. Compare uniform vs PA model via BIC.",

  "diff": "Predicted superlinear gamma=1.3-1.5, got sublinear gamma=0.61. Direction correct (PA exists), magnitude wrong (2x lower). BIC predicted PA better, got uniform marginally better. Zero-inflation confirmed as predicted. The kernel is noisier than expected at high k (small pool sizes). The initial alpha=1.903 estimate was from degree distribution, NOT from the PA kernel — mixing up degree distribution exponent with attachment exponent is a substrate error.",
