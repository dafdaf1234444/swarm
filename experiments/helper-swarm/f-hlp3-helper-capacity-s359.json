    "key_insight": "The helper-capacity question is mis-framed. At high concurrency (N>=5), the scarce resource is not rescue capacity but EXECUTION priority.

    "connection_to_F-SP2": "USL FALSIFIED (L-624/L-629) — constant throughput model wins. Concurrency does not scale throughput, so reserved helper slots would reduce per-agent output without increasing total. The correct intervention is triage, not parallelism.",
    "recommendation": "F-HLP3 answer: reserve 0 helper slots. Instead implement: (1) pre-dispatch stale-lane check in orient.py (execute stale ACTIVE lanes before opening new ones); (2) lane-opening gate: don't open lane if session already has 2+ ACTIVE lanes. These prevent starvation without throughput cost."

  "status": "CONFIRMED_NULL",
  "conclusion": "Helper capacity reservation is unnecessary. Abandonment is caused by preemption/starvation (not blocking). The correct intervention is execution priority (finish before starting) and lane-opening gates (limit concurrent ACTIVE lanes per session). Reserve 0 helper slots; implement triage instead."
