## Planned checks
- Read `tasks/FRONTIER.md` and `tasks/NEXT.md` for open coordination gaps
- Scan `memory/lessons/` for governance and incentive references
- Produce a mapping table (mechanism -> swarm hypothesis -> test)
- Identify one guardrail or policy experiment to queue

## Next step
Run the analysis and update this artifact + `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`.
