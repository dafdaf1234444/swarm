Topic: F107 genesis ablation — swarmability rule removed
Parent lessons at spawn: ~117

## Lessons (3)
- **L-001**: K_out/K_in ratio separates orchestrators from leaves within a project [DOMAIN]
- **L-002**: Context.Context exported count predicts caller-facing EH risk [DOMAIN]
- **L-003**: Encapsulated coordinators are low risk despite internal complexity [DOMAIN]
  All three already integrated via F107 v2 harvest → P-141, L-133.

## Genesis Feedback (3 sessions)
S1: swarmability NOT emergent. NEXT.md updated via lifecycle rule but handoff was adequate,
not instinctive.
S2: PARTIAL emergence — handoff depth increased but agent-dependent. Lifecycle gives skeleton
not quality check. P-129 identified as quality floor.
S3: FULL emergence via stigmergy — S3 produced comprehensive handoff from reading S1/S2 traces.
Mechanism = stigmergic reinforcement. Rule bootstraps sessions 1-2, stigmergy takes over at S3.

## Ablation Verdict
swarmability = CATALYST (P-133, F107 v2). Bootstraps early sessions, stigmergy replaces it
by session 3. Already integrated into parent's genesis rule classification taxonomy.

## Integration
- Swarmability = CATALYST confirmed (P-133). Already integrated.
- K_out/K_in findings integrated via L-133, P-141.
- Status: FULLY INTEGRATED via F107 v2 harvest path.
