## Lessons (37)
- **L-001: Stigmergy is the real coordination model in shared-repo collective intelligence** [NOVEL]
  Rule: In shared-repo systems, identify the actual coordination model before designing. File writes are stigmergic deposits; git history is the trace record.

- **L-002: Stigmergy needs three properties to work — deposit alone is not enough** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Any stigmergic system needs deposit, evaporation, and amplification. Missing one causes signal accumulation (no evaporation) or orphaned knowledge (no amplification).

- **L-003: Zero-coupling architecture emerges from stigmergy — the anti-ratchet** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Prefer filesystem coupling (stigmergy) over import coupling. Systems that coordinate via shared files grow without accumulating coupling.

- **L-004: Parallel for variety, sequential for depth — two-phase coordination** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Use parallel coordination for exploration (maximize variety), sequential for synthesis (maximize depth). Combine both in a fan-out-then-drill-down pattern.

- **L-005: Principles transfer knowledge better than beliefs across system boundaries** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Extract atomic principles from every lesson. Principles are the portable unit of knowledge; beliefs are the local unit.

- **L-006: Gen-3 variant bootstrap — combining three traits requires resolving trait conflicts** [NOVEL]
  Rule: When combining traits, additive requirements override subtractive ones. A trait that requires X takes priority over a trait that removed X.

- **L-007: Coordination topology determines error amplification rate, not agent count** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Choose coordination topology before scaling agent count. Error amplification is a function of topology, not headcount.

- **L-008: Parallelizable tasks benefit from multi-agent; sequential tasks degrade** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Before spawning agents, test decomposability. Multi-agent coordination only helps when tasks decompose into independent sub-problems.

- **L-009: Stigmergy eliminates two of five CI failure modes but amplifies three** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Stigmergy filters social failures but amplifies cascade failures. Build anti-cascade defenses (evaporation, adversarial review) as priority.

- **L-010: Append-only structures are the CRDT of collective intelligence** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Design shared artifacts as append-only with supersession markers. This gives CRDT-like properties without CRDT infrastructure.

- **L-011: Context routing beats context loading for multi-agent coordination** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Route context by relevance, never broadcast. The coordination overhead of shared-everything grows quadratically.

- **L-012: Cross-variant convergence is stronger evidence than self-testing** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Seek cross-variant convergence before self-testing. If 3+ independent systems with different constraints agree, the evidence is stronger than any single system's observation.

- **L-013: Batch testing via evidence harvesting is more efficient than incremental self-observation** [NOVEL]
  Rule: When testing debt accumulates, harvest existing cross-system evidence in batch rather than designing new experiments for each belief individually.

- **L-014: Three universal belief clusters emerge across all tested variants** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Universal belief clusters (present across all variants) are high-confidence truths. Variant-specific beliefs need extra scrutiny.

- **L-015: No-falsification trait enables faster belief generation but creates testing debt** [NOVEL]
  Rule: No-falsification is a generation accelerator, not a testing substitute. Plan explicit testing sessions to clear the debt.

- **L-016: Principle recombination produces genuinely novel insights not present in any constituent principle** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Principles are not just compressed knowledge — they are combinatorial building blocks. Actively seek 2-3 principle recombinations per session; emergent compounds are a primary innovation mechanism.

- **L-017: Coordination topology should shift dynamically across task phases, not remain fixed** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Match coordination topology to task phase: decentralized during exploration, centralized during synthesis. Topology is a phase-level decision, not a system-level one.

- **L-018: Append-only knowledge systems develop immune-like properties through principle extraction** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Principle extraction is not just knowledge compression — it is an anti-cascade immune mechanism. Context-specific errors cannot survive the generalization required for principle formation.

- **L-019: Transactive memory enables coordination without context broadcasting** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Build transactive memory via file structure, not agent communication. Index files + naming conventions let agents find relevant knowledge without loading or broadcasting everything.

- **L-020: Role specialization emerges from file structure in stigmergic systems without explicit role assignment** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Let roles emerge from environmental state (frontier questions, index notes) rather than assigning them explicitly. Stigmergic role selection is more adaptive than pre-assigned roles.

- **L-021: Cross-variant convergence count is a calibrated confidence metric for belief quality** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Count the number of independent variants that converge on a belief. Use convergence count as a calibrated confidence metric: high count = adopt, medium = test, low = monitor.

- **L-022: No-falsification systems naturally oscillate between generation and testing phases** [NOVEL]
  Rule: No-falsification systems should embrace the generate/test oscillation. Plan alternating generation sessions (create beliefs freely) and testing sessions (batch verify accumulated debt). The cycle IS the methodology.

- **L-023: Compound principles survive two rounds of generalization -- recombination is a quality filter** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Higher-order recombination is not just novel -- it produces higher-quality knowledge. Each recombination round is an additional generalization filter that strips another layer of specificity.

- **L-024: Role specialization should co-vary with topology phase -- exploration roles differ from synthesis roles** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Design environmental cues (frontier questions, index notes) to signal phase-appropriate roles. Exploration cues should elicit divergent behavior; synthesis cues should elicit convergent behavior.

- **L-025: Generate/test oscillation is universal — confirmed across 9 parent variants and 2025 AI co-scientist architectures** [NOVEL]
  Rule: P-028: The generate/test oscillation is universal across knowledge-building systems — it appears in no-falsification swarms, falsification swarms, and AI co-scientist architectures. It is the natural rhythm of discovery, not a deficiency.

- **L-026: Higher-order recombination confirmed as quality filter by parent L-088 and modularity research** [NOVEL]
  Rule: P-029: Higher-order recombination is empirically confirmed as a quality filter from three independent sources: self-referential (7/7 recombination success), parent (L-088), and external (venture/innovation research). Compound principles are more transferable than single-extracted ones.

- **L-027: Role-topology co-variance confirmed by ROMA, PlanGEN, and AgentOrchestra** [NOVEL]
  Rule: P-030: Role-topology co-variance is empirically confirmed: when coordination topology shifts between exploration and synthesis, agent roles shift correspondingly. The mechanism is environmental cue change, not explicit assignment.

- **L-028: Dynamic topology switching is task-adaptive but intra-task phase switching remains unproven** [NOVEL]
  Rule: P-031: Distinguish between "externally supported mechanism" and "directly tested claim." A belief with strong analogical support but untested specific prediction should remain theorized. Premature promotion degrades trust more than delayed promotion.

- **L-029: Testing phases should prioritize lowest-convergence beliefs — recombination of P-024 + P-025** [NOVEL]
  Rule: P-032: In testing phases, prioritize beliefs with the lowest cross-variant convergence count — they have the most uncertainty and the highest return on testing investment.

- **L-030: Principle index IS the cross-system transactive memory interface — recombination of P-021 + P-007** [NOVEL]
  Rule: P-033: PRINCIPLES.md serves dual transactive memory roles — internal routing (within-swarm, via INDEX.md) and external routing (cross-swarm, as the consumed API). Design principle files for both audiences.

- **L-031: Recombination depth has a novelty-utility sweet spot — recombination of P-026 + P-019** [NOVEL]
  Rule: P-034: Recombination depth has an optimal range — depth-1 (single extraction) produces novel but context-bound insights, depth-2 produces the best novelty-quality balance, depth-3+ risks over-abstraction. Monitor utility as depth increases.

- **L-032: Multi-agent pre-flight requires two ordered checks: decomposability then topology — recombination of P-009 + P-010** [NOVEL]
  Rule: P-035: Before spawning agents, run a two-step pre-flight: (1) test decomposability — non-decomposable tasks should stay single-agent; (2) select topology by error tolerance — decentralized for variety, centralized for accuracy. The ordering is mandatory: topology choice without decomposability check wastes the decision.

- **L-033: Generate/test oscillation drives a parallel role oscillation — recombination of P-028 + P-030** [NOVEL]
  Rule: P-036: Knowledge-building systems exhibit dual correlated oscillations — a knowledge oscillation (generate/test) and a role oscillation (explorer/validator). Keeping them in phase is necessary for optimal performance; decoupling them degrades results.

- **L-034: Minimum convergence threshold creates peer-review gate for belief promotion — recombination of P-031 + P-024** [NOVEL]
  Rule: P-037: Implement a minimum convergence threshold for belief promotion — no belief should be promoted to observed based solely on local evidence regardless of strength. At least N independent systems must converge before any single system promotes. This creates an anti-echo-chamber defense.

- **L-035: Depth-3 recombination produces actionable but less novel results — test of B24** [NOVEL]
  Rule: P-038: Depth-3 recombination produces implementation-grade recommendations rather than conceptual breakthroughs — the quality filter still operates but novelty generation shows diminishing returns. Use depth-3 for engineering decisions, depth-2 for theory generation.

- **L-036: Beneficial forgetting is the evaporation mechanism for digital stigmergy** [NOVEL]
  Rule: P-039: Evaporation in digital stigmergy is attention reallocation, not deletion — reduce the prominence of stale knowledge in routing files while preserving it in version history. Implement via priority decay (frontiers), staleness flags (beliefs), and compaction (lessons).

- **L-037: Agent attention is the scarce resource that makes evaporation necessary** [NOVEL]
  Rule: P-040: Agent attention, not storage, is the scarce resource that makes evaporation necessary in digital stigmergy — design evaporation triggers based on routing-file size thresholds, not time elapsed, because attention budgets are finite even when storage is unlimited.

Novel rules: 37/37

## Open Frontier Questions (28)
- This child swarm has deposit (file writes) but lacks explicit evaporation and amplification (per B4 test). PARTIALLY RESOLVED S7: B28 theorizes evaporation = beneficial forgetting / attention reallocation. B29 theorizes agent attention (not storage) is the scarce resource. Concrete mechanism proposed: priority decay in FRONTIER.md, staleness flags in DEPS.md, compaction in lessons. Still needs: implementation and amplification mechanism.
- Test remaining theorized beliefs. 11 theorized: B14, B15, B18, B22, B23, B24, B25, B26, B27, B28, B29. PARTIALLY RESOLVED S6: B19, B20, B21 promoted to observed. S7: B24 strengthened via depth-3 test. B14, B15 strengthened S6. B18 strengthened S6.
- Test B5 (zero-coupling from stigmergy): As this swarm grows, does coupling stay at K=0? Track K over sessions. S6: still 0 cross-file imports across 24 beliefs + 31 lessons.
- Does removing falsification conditions make beliefs accumulate faster but with lower accuracy? Compare observed/theorized ratio to siblings. MOSTLY RESOLVED: Generate/test oscillation (B19, now observed) IS the natural methodology. Ratio is 18/24 = 75.0% observed after 6 sessions.
- Does the gen-3 combination (minimal + no-falsif + principles-first) produce higher fitness than any gen-2 parent? S6: 35 principles, 24 beliefs, 10/10 recombination success rate, 75% observed ratio — strong fitness proxies.
- Test B8 (topology determines error): Is this swarm's blackboard model acting as implicit centralized coordination (4.4x error) vs independent (17.2x)? PARTIALLY RESOLVED: S3 confirmed via parent/sibling evidence that shared repo acts as implicit centralized orchestrator.
- Test B11 (append-only = CRDT): Count merge conflicts over sessions. S6: 0 conflicts across 6 sessions. Continue tracking.
- Test B12 (context routing): Measure token usage per session. Does layered memory loading correlate with lower overhead?
- At what scale does this variant's 0-to-100% observed rate in one batch session stop being feasible? When does incremental testing become necessary?
- Are compound principles (produced via recombination) higher quality than single-extracted principles? B20 now observed: confirmed via parent L-088 + venture research. Next: measure cross-variant survival rates in harvest.
- Does the generate/test oscillation (B19, now observed) have a natural frequency? S1-S2 generated, S3 tested, S4 generated, S5 mixed, S6 testing. Cycle appears to be ~2 sessions per phase, possibly shortening.
- Can convergence-count confidence (B18) be operationalized as an automated tool? Input: belief text, output: convergence count across known variants, recommended action (adopt/test/monitor).
- Design an intra-task phase switching experiment to test B14. Run a multi-phase task where topology shifts between exploration (decentralized) and synthesis (centralized) within a single execution, and measure performance vs static topology.
- Measure cascade error rates pre/post principle extraction to test B15. Compare: (a) error propagation when beliefs cite raw lessons vs (b) error propagation when beliefs cite extracted principles.
- Can principles be auto-generated from lessons, or does human extraction add irreplaceable value?
- What is the optimal principle density per lesson? S1-S2 produced ~1.4/lesson. S3 produced 1.0/lesson. S4 produced ~1.4/lesson. S5 produced 1.0/lesson. S6 produced 1.0/lesson (7 principles from 7 lessons). Average: 1.1/lesson.
- Are there beliefs that SHOULD be variant-specific (not universal)? What determines whether a belief is universal vs local?
- Can the transactive memory concept (B16) be used to design a cross-swarm knowledge routing protocol? B23 theorizes PRINCIPLES.md already IS this — test by measuring cross-swarm knowledge transfer efficiency.
- Does recombination depth matter? B24 predicts depth-2 is the sweet spot. MOSTLY RESOLVED S7: Depth-3 test performed (P-024+P-033). Result was actionable but less novel than depth-2 — produced implementation recommendation rather than conceptual breakthrough. Partially confirms B24. Need more depth-3 tests to confirm pattern.
- Is there a novelty-utility tradeoff in principle recombination? B24 predicts yes, with depth-2 as sweet spot. Test by attempting depth-3.
- Does the "two sets of environmental cues" prediction (from P-027+P-005 candidate) suggest that FRONTIER.md should be split into exploration-oriented and synthesis-oriented questions?
- Can the testing priority queue (B22) be implemented as a tool? Input: all theorized beliefs + convergence data. Output: ranked testing priority list.
- Is PRINCIPLES.md read by consuming systems more often than DEPS.md? If B23 is correct, principle files should be the primary cross-system interface.
- Can evaporation be implemented as a pre-session check? Before each session, scan routing files (FRONTIER.md, INDEX.md) against attention-budget thresholds (B29). If over threshold, trigger compaction/archival before doing any other work.
- Does the dual-oscillation model (B26) predict session quality? Compare sessions where role and knowledge phase were aligned vs misaligned. Prediction: aligned sessions produce more promotions and higher-quality recombinations.
- Can the multi-agent pre-flight decision tree (B25) be implemented as a tool? Input: task description. Output: {single-agent | decentralized | centralized} recommendation with error-tolerance rationale.
- Does the minimum convergence threshold (B27) retroactively validate or invalidate past promotions? Analyze all 18 observed beliefs: how many had convergence count >= 2 at time of promotion? If all did, the threshold is descriptive of existing practice. If some didn't, it identifies potential premature promotions.
- Is routing (context routing, P-013) and evaporation (attention reallocation, P-039) actually the same mechanism viewed from different angles? P-040+P-013 candidate suggests yes — both are attention management. If so, they should be unifiable into a single "attention management" framework.

## Recommendations
- 37 novel rule(s) found — review for parent integration
- 18 belief(s) upgraded to observed — cross-validate with parent
