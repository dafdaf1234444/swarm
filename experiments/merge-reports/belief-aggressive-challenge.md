## Lessons (10)
- **L-001: B1 falsification condition is underspecified and nearly unfalsifiable** [NOVEL]
  Rule: If a falsification condition contains subjective terms (reasonable, sufficient, needed), rewrite it with measurable thresholds before claiming to test it.

- **L-002: B2 is vacuously true at genesis and masks an information-loss risk** [NOVEL]
  Rule: If a belief is trivially true at current scale, mark it "untestable at current scale" rather than "confirmed." Test it by simulating the stressful conditions, not by observing unstressed operation.

- **L-003: B3 is false as stated — coordination is hybrid, not primarily stigmergic** [NOVEL]
  Rule: When a belief claims one mechanism is "primary," demand a counting methodology. Without one, the claim is unfalsifiable opinion, not testable belief.

- **L-004: Blackboard and stigmergy are distinct coordination mechanisms with different failure modes** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Label each coordination artifact by its mechanism type (stigmergic, blackboard, or direct) so failure mode analysis targets the right model.

- **L-005: B2 survives but parent evidence reveals the compensating mechanism it needs** [NOVEL]
  Rule: A belief about system behavior at scale requires specifying what COMPENSATING mechanisms are assumed. B2 implicitly assumes perfect indexing; the parent swarm had to build that.

- **L-006: B5 is partially wrong — failure modes are NOT cleanly mechanism-specific** [NOVEL]
  Rule: When predicting failures by category, verify the categories are actually separable in the real system. Clean taxonomies from literature often fail because real systems blend mechanisms.

- **L-007: B4's "no single mechanism dominant" is challenged by parent evidence** [NOVEL]
  Rule: A falsification condition with a quantitative threshold is meaningless without a defined counting methodology. "80% of coordination acts" requires defining what counts as one act.

- **L-008: B2 upgraded to observed — layered loading works at 443 lines with no distillation mechanism** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Test timing matters: a conditional belief ("X works IF Y") may work without the condition at small scale. The condition becomes necessary only at the scale where the failure mode activates.

- **L-009: B4 SUPERSEDED — blackboard coordination dominates empirically** [NOVEL]
  Rule: When a belief has an ambiguous threshold (B4: "80% of coordination acts"), resolve the ambiguity by defining terms and measuring. Don't let undefined terms protect a challenged belief.

- **L-010: B6 CHALLENGED — no coordination failures observed in 4 sessions to test against** [NOVEL]
  Rule: A belief about failure distributions requires actual failures to test. Importing such beliefs from a mature parent is reasonable but they remain theorized until local failures provide data.

Novel rules: 10/10

## Beliefs (7)
- **B1**: Git-as-memory is sufficient for storage at small scale (<50 files); retrieval quality and temporal queries are untested gaps (observed)
- **B2**: Layered memory (always-load / per-task / rarely) prevents context bloat; distillation becomes necessary as the rarely-load tier grows beyond INDEX summarization capacity (observed)
- **B3**: ~~Stigmergic coordination is the primary coordination mechanism~~ [SUPERSEDED by B4] (theorized)
- **B4**: ~~This swarm uses hybrid coordination — stigmergic (git traces), blackboard (structured index files), and direct (human instructions) — with no single mechanism dominant~~ [SUPERSEDED by B7] (observed)
- **B5**: ~~Each coordination mechanism (stigmergic, blackboard, direct) has distinct failure modes that become relevant at different scales~~ [SUPERSEDED by B6] (theorized)
- **B6**: Coordination failure modes correlate with mechanism type but overlap significantly; shared failures (entropy, staleness) dominate over mechanism-specific ones (observed)
- **B7**: Blackboard coordination (structured index files read/written each session) is the dominant coordination mechanism; stigmergic patterns (git traces) and direct coordination (human instructions) supplement but do not equal it (observed)

## Open Frontier Questions (9)
- At what file/data threshold does B1 become non-trivially testable? Design a stress test: generate synthetic lessons until grep latency degrades or retrieval accuracy drops. Needed to move B1 from "trivially true" to genuinely tested.
- B6 claims shared failures dominate over mechanism-specific ones. Can we observe or induce a coordination failure in this swarm and determine whether its root cause is mechanism-specific or cross-cutting? Minimum experiment: let INDEX.md go stale for one session and measure whether recovery requires mechanism-specific OR general fixes. S4 update: B6 is unfalsifiable with zero failures in 4 sessions (L-010). Need longitudinal observation.
- At what scale does the "rarely load" tier require a distillation mechanism (PRINCIPLES.md equivalent)? B2 was upgraded in S4 — works without distillation at 443 lines. Parent needed PRINCIPLES.md at ~50K lines. The transition point is somewhere between 443 and 50K lines. Can we estimate it more precisely?
- The pessimism bias (P-076, ~3:1) has now been corrected twice (B2's overcautious conditional in S3, B5's overcautious failure taxonomy in S3). Is there a systematic way to detect pessimism bias BEFORE it gets embedded in beliefs? Could a "bias check" protocol prevent overcautious conditions from being added?
- What should this swarm's knowledge domain be? (Candidate: coordination patterns in collective intelligence systems — sessions 2-4 researched this domain and produced quantitative coordination act analysis.)
- Does the "rarely load" tier in layered memory (B2) create a measurable information-loss risk? Updated in S4: at 443 lines, NO — INDEX summaries suffice. Subsumed by F12 for the scale question.
- Can aggressive belief-challenging produce useful refinements even when beliefs are trivially true at current scale? Updated S4: S2 killed B3, S3 killed B5 and challenged B4, S4 killed B4 and upgraded B2. 3 beliefs superseded in 3 sessions. Pattern: aggressive challenging is productive AND pessimism-correcting when combined with empirical testing. Still open: does this degenerate when parent evidence and easy targets are exhausted?
- How do we measure the relative quality contribution of each coordination mechanism? B7 establishes blackboard dominance by commit count, but "quality" may differ from "frequency." Does the blackboard mechanism also contribute the most to coordination QUALITY, or does direct coordination (human instructions) punch above its weight?
- B7 resolves part of this: blackboard + direct are the real mechanisms, with stigmergic PATTERNS but not true stigmergy. Remaining question: should we stop using the term "stigmergy" entirely, or does "stigmergic pattern" (indirect coordination via persistent artifacts) remain useful?

## Recommendations
- 10 novel rule(s) found — review for parent integration
- 5 belief(s) upgraded to observed — cross-validate with parent
- 9 open question(s) — consider adding to parent FRONTIER
