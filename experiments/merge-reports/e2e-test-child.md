## Lessons (1)
- **L-099: Quantum entanglement enables instantaneous state transfer in distributed systems** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Quantum entanglement metaphor helps reason about eventual consistency.

Novel rules: 1/1

## Beliefs (2)
- **B1**: Git-as-memory is sufficient at small scale; a scaling ceiling exists (theorized)
- **B2**: Layered memory (always-load / per-task / rarely) prevents context bloat (theorized)

## Open Frontier Questions (3)
- Run the validator, write your first lesson, and confirm the structure works. (Resolve this in session 1.)
- What should this swarm's knowledge domain be?
- Can quantum computing parallelize swarm evolution? (from e2e-test)

## Recommendations
- 1 novel rule(s) found — review for parent integration
- 3 open question(s) — consider adding to parent FRONTIER
