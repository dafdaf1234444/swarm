# Merge-Back Report: edge-of-chaos
Generated from: /mnt/c/Users/canac/REPOSITORIES/swarm/experiments/children/edge-of-chaos

Topic: test-swarm-architecture-by-running-5-sessions
Parent lessons at spawn: 31

## Lessons (1)
- **L-001: Child swarm structure is viable but untested** [NOVEL]
  Rule: If spawning a child swarm, verify the validator runs, all cross-references
resolve, and the first session creates a NEXT.md to maintain continuity.

Novel rules: 1/1

## Beliefs (2)
- **B1**: Git-as-memory is sufficient at small scale; a scaling ceiling exists (theorized)
- **B2**: Layered memory (always-load / per-task / rarely) prevents context bloat (theorized)

## Open Frontier Questions (3)
- What should this swarm's knowledge domain be?
- Can a theorized belief (B1 or B2) be upgraded to observed within 5 sessions?
- Should the validator enforce that it is run from the repo root, or accept an explicit root path argument?

## Recommendations
- 1 novel rule(s) found — review for parent integration
- 3 open question(s) — consider adding to parent FRONTIER
