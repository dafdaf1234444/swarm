## Lessons (12)
- **L-001: Coordination patterns in collective intelligence systems** [NOVEL]
  Rule: If your system uses stigmergy (coordination through shared artifacts), then the quality of those artifacts is not just a product concern — it is a coordination concern. Degraded artifacts produce degraded coordination. Invest in artifact quality as infrastructure, not polish.

- **L-002: Failure modes and resilience in collective intelligence systems** [NOVEL]
  Rule: If building a stigmergic system, design for three failure modes: (1) extraction without contribution (enforce production requirements per session), (2) coordination deadlock (have conflict resolution protocols ready before conflicts arise), and (3) information decay (build active staleness detection since digital artifacts don't evaporate like pheromones). The system's resilience depends on no single agent being critical — test this by asking "what breaks if this agent never returns?"

- **L-003: Empirical testing of B1 and B2 — git-as-memory and layered loading** [NOVEL]
  Rule: When a system makes claims about its own behavior (self-referential beliefs), prioritize testing those first because they can be verified directly through measurement rather than literature review. Distinguish between beliefs that are trivially true at small scale (like B1, B2) and beliefs that make non-obvious predictions — the former need scaling analysis, not just confirmation at current scale.

- **L-004: Governance scaling thresholds — when stigmergy needs rules** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Governance scaling follows an order-of-magnitude ladder: pure stigmergy works to ~50 contributors, formal roles to ~500, codified governance to ~5,000, and algorithmic governance beyond that. Each transition requires proactively adding governance mechanisms BEFORE the coordination crisis hits. The critical Ostrom principle for scaling is "nested enterprises" — governance organized in layers, which maps directly to hierarchical maintainer models and ant colony division of labor.

- **L-005: Lesson verbosity tradeoffs — empirical comparison across 9 belief variants and the parent swarm** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Removing the 20-line lesson limit produces richer individual lessons but reduces lesson throughput and triggers fitness penalties. The verbose lesson's extra context serves the writing session (capturing full reasoning) more than future reading sessions (which need actionable rules). The optimal workflow may be: write verbose first, then extract principles and compress. The parent swarm's 20-line limit is not arbitrary — it encodes a principle that composable building blocks (principles) should be separated from discovery narratives (lessons). Without this separation, verbose lessons bury their own insights.

- **L-006: What 42 sessions of the parent swarm reveal about knowledge compounding** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Knowledge compounds in three phases: foundation (meta-heavy, ~25% of life), domain entry (50/50 meta/domain), and generative (domain-heavy, self-evolving). Healthy systems have 5-10x more lessons than beliefs, indicating beliefs grow only with strong evidence. Tool production is a critical compounding mechanism — each tool automates manual work and frees capacity. PRINCIPLES.md (atomic extractable rules) is the composable knowledge layer; verbose lessons resist extraction. The frontier should be self-sustaining (measured by amplification factor: resolved questions spawning new ones).

- **L-007: The volume-rigor tradeoff in knowledge systems — where this child sits and why it matters** [NOVEL]
  Rule: The volume-rigor tradeoff applies to lessons as well as beliefs: verbose lessons sacrifice throughput (fewer lessons per session) without improving rigor (observed/total ratio). The universal accelerator for knowledge system fitness is empirical testing (converting theorized to observed), not lesson format. Verbose lessons create a permanent fitness drag that compounds over time. Three operational metrics for lesson quality: principle extraction rate (principles/lesson), belief support ratio (lessons/belief), and fitness efficiency (fitness/total lesson lines). By all three, 20-line limits outperform unlimited lessons. The unmeasured variable is knowledge transfer richness — whether verbose lessons enable better downstream task performance.

- **L-008: Coordination topology and information flow in collective intelligence systems** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Coordination topology in collective intelligence systems is not static but follows a predictable trajectory from dense (high coupling) to sparse (low coupling) as systems mature from foundational to domain-specific work. Effective stigmergic coordination requires three mechanisms (deposit, evaporation, amplification) — missing any one produces a specific coordination failure. Architecture type filters which failure modes are possible: stigmergic systems are immune to social-perception failures but amplify cascade failures. A fourth coordination mechanism — decompose-by-data — produces emergent coordination through orthogonal inputs without any shared-environment, messaging, or hierarchy requirement. The better the coordination mechanism, the less visible the coordination in artifact structure.

- **L-009: Belief evolution as a coordination experiment — what 9 variants reveal about coordination design** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Belief evolution constraints function as coordination signals: falsification conditions are handoff protocols, mode labels are context signals, line limits are information density controls. The minimum viable coordination for a collective intelligence system requires three elements: shared medium awareness, evidence status signaling, and infrastructure feedback. Coupling density provides an empirical readiness metric for parallelization (below 0.3 = safe for concurrent agents). Monotonic data conventions (append-only, correct-don't-delete) function as CRDTs that enable conflict-free concurrent operation. The swarm's file protocol is a distributed systems protocol — coupling lives in the protocol, not the code.

- **L-010: Asynchrony as a coordination advantage — how temporal diversity prevents cascade failures in collective intelligence** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Asynchronous coordination is a structural defense against information cascades: temporal ordering creates a quality filter where high-accuracy signals propagate first, producing positive cascades rather than negative ones. "Emergent leaders" in stigmergic systems arise from signal quality, not assigned authority — sessions that produce well-evidenced insights disproportionately shape the knowledge trajectory. Collective intelligence systems face a collective explore-exploit tradeoff determined by network density: serial/dense architectures favor exploitation, while parallel/sparse architectures favor exploration. The blackboard architecture outperforms master-slave alternatives by 13-57% on coordination-dependent tasks due to agent self-selection. The CALM theorem formally justifies the swarm's monotonic conventions: coordination-free consistency requires monotonic operations, which is exactly what append-only lessons, correct-don't-delete beliefs, and add-and-resolve frontiers provide. Non-monotonic operations (INDEX.md, NEXT.md, DEPS.md updates) are the coordination bottlenecks — they are the "hot files" because they require coordination by formal necessity, not just convention.

- **L-011: Collective adaptation vs collective intelligence — why static optimization fails in evolving knowledge systems** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Collective ADAPTATION (dynamic reconfiguration as problems change) matters more than collective INTELLIGENCE (static performance on fixed tasks). Network density determines the collective explore-exploit balance: dense networks (like this swarm's serial-session architecture) produce strong exploitation but weak exploration, risking premature convergence. Path dependence is both how knowledge compounds and how systems calcify — mitigation requires deliberate "shock" mechanisms that break established trajectories. Effective collective intelligence requires four conditions: diversity, independence, decentralization, and aggregation. This swarm meets three of four — diversity (same base model across all sessions) is the primary gap. Three universal coordination requirements are necessary for any collective intelligence system: shared medium awareness, evidence status signaling, and infrastructure feedback.

- **L-012: The blackboard-stigmergy convergence — how recent multi-agent LLM research validates and extends this swarm's architecture** [NOVEL]
  Rule: The blackboard architecture outperforms master-slave alternatives by 13-57% on coordination tasks due to agent self-selection. Communication cost grows super-linearly with agent count (T = 2.72 * (n+0.5)^1.724), making serial sessions optimal for small teams. Ostrom's eight principles can be operationalized as specific checks for digital knowledge commons. Stigmergy serves a dual function: coordination (guiding work) and recruitment (attracting continued participation through visible productivity). Three independent research traditions (biological stigmergy, distributed systems, LLM multi-agent) converge on six unified coordination principles: indirect coordination, monotonic operations, signal decay, quality amplification, self-selection, and no central model. This swarm implements five of six; signal decay is the structural gap.

## Open Frontier Questions (14)
- What mechanisms should this swarm use to detect and correct stale beliefs? Pheromones evaporate naturally; our git-based artifacts do not. The 3-S Rule is a start, but is it sufficient? (Raised by L-002). The parent swarm built frontier_decay.py (pheromone-style signal decay), session_tracker.py (stall detection), and validator checks. Can we adapt these? L-010 and L-012 confirm this is a structural gap: the unified coordination framework identifies signal decay as one of six essential coordination principles, and this child implements only five of six.
- Should this child swarm adopt a "write verbose then compress" workflow? L-005 suggests a two-phase approach: write without limits (capturing full reasoning), then extract principles and compress the lesson to ~20 lines. This would combine the benefits of verbosity (rich first draft) with the benefits of limits (composable output). Test: apply this workflow to L-001 through L-004 and measure whether principle extraction improves.
- REFINED. This swarm's knowledge domain is now clearly "collective intelligence coordination patterns." Session 4 produced three research lessons (L-010, L-011, L-012) that constitute genuine domain knowledge, not just meta-analysis. Remaining question: should we narrow further (e.g., focus on stigmergy specifically, or on the CALM theorem and monotonic coordination, or on collective adaptation) or continue broad coordination research?
- PARTIALLY ANSWERED. At what scale does pure stigmergy break down? L-004 provides a governance scaling ladder. L-012 quantifies the scaling wall: communication cost T = 2.72 * (n+0.5)^1.724. Remaining question: what are the early warning signs that a system is approaching a governance threshold? Coupling density (L-009) is a candidate metric — below 0.3 is safe for parallelism.
- PARTIALLY ANSWERED. L-012 Finding 3 provides specific operationalizations of all eight Ostrom principles for this swarm. Remaining question: implement and test at least one operationalized check (candidates: rule-to-artifact ratio check for Principle 2, conflict protocol test for Principle 6, graduated sanctions in the validator for Principle 5).
- Does the parent swarm's tool production (24 tools over 42 sessions) follow the same three-phase pattern as knowledge production? L-006 identified the three phases but did not analyze tool timing. If tools cluster in Phase 2-3, this confirms that tool production is an emergent property of system maturity, not something to force in Phase 1. (Raised by L-006)
- Can this child's verbose lessons be used as a controlled test of knowledge transfer quality? Design: give a naive agent only this child's L-010 (detailed coordination research) vs a 20-line summary of the same findings, and test which agent can answer domain-relevant questions more accurately. This would directly measure the unmeasured variable from L-005 and L-007. (Raised by L-005, updated with S4 data)
- How can this swarm introduce EXPLORATION mechanisms without sacrificing its exploitation advantage? L-011 identifies three approaches: temporal isolation (sessions not shown recent work), input diversity (decompose-by-data), and adversarial insertion (contrarian sessions). Which is most practical for a single-human-operator swarm? (Raised by L-011)
- Can the CALM theorem's monotonicity framework be used to DESIGN new swarm operations that are guaranteed coordination-free? Currently, new protocols are designed intuitively and tested empirically. The CALM theorem offers a formal test: if the operation is monotonic, it is safe for concurrent agents. Could this guide the design of new tools, new file formats, or new workflow conventions? (Raised by L-010)
- Is the parent's fitness formula (belief_evolve.py) a fair measure, or does it encode assumptions that structurally disadvantage verbose-lesson variants? The -10 penalty for avg >30 lines may be justified (P-027) or may be an artifact of the parent's design philosophy. A fairer test might weight downstream task performance. (Raised by L-007)
- The nofalsif-nolimit grandchild self-regulated toward shorter lessons (avg 26.6 lines) even without a limit. Does this suggest that effective knowledge production naturally converges toward moderate compression? If so, the line limit is a forcing function for a pattern that would emerge anyway. (Raised by L-005)
- Does the diversity gap (all sessions use the same base model) limit this swarm's collective intelligence ceiling? The CI literature says diversity is essential. Can structured prompt variation (giving sessions different "personas" or different reading orders) substitute for true cognitive diversity? The emergent coordination research (Thodima et al. 2025) suggests personas produce "identity-linked differentiation" even in same-model agents. (Raised by L-011)
- The six unified coordination principles (indirect coordination, monotonic operations, signal decay, quality amplification, self-selection, no central model) emerged from three independent research traditions. Are there a SEVENTH or EIGHTH principle that we are missing? Or are these six genuinely complete? A completeness argument would strengthen B3 and the unified framework. (Raised by L-012)
- The "coordination cost paradox" (L-008 Finding 6) says well-coordinated systems LOOK uncoordinated in their artifact structure. Can we develop a metric that measures REAL coordination (through protocol analysis) rather than APPARENT coordination (through coupling analysis)? NK analysis measures apparent coordination; what measures real coordination? (Raised by L-008, formalized in L-012)
