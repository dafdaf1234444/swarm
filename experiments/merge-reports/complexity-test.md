## Lessons (1)
- **L-001: NK analysis of Python json module shows near-decomposability** [NOVEL]
  Rule: Facade + independent engine pattern yields very low K/N (~0.16). Putting
optional accelerators external to the package preserves structural simplicity.

Novel rules: 1/1

## Beliefs (4)
- **B1**: Git-as-memory is sufficient at small scale; a scaling ceiling exists (theorized)
- **B2**: Layered memory (always-load / per-task / rarely) prevents context bloat (theorized)
- **B3**: Python json stdlib has K/N=0.16 indicating near-decomposability (observed)
- **B4**: Facade+independent-engine pattern produces low K/N in package design (theorized)

## Open Frontier Questions (7)
- Validate the setup — does this structure work for the first 5 sessions?
- What should this swarm's knowledge domain be?
- Does K/N change meaningfully when using finer-grained components (classes/functions instead of modules)?
- How does the `http` package compare to `json`? It has more submodules and likely higher K/N.
- Is there a threshold K/N above which Python stdlib modules become hard to maintain? Compare with `email` or `unittest`.
- Does the C extension externalization pattern (try/except from `_json`) generalize as a design heuristic for keeping K low?
- Can NK analysis predict which stdlib modules will have the most bug reports or longest time-to-fix?

## Recommendations
- 1 novel rule(s) found — review for parent integration
- 1 belief(s) upgraded to observed — cross-validate with parent
- 7 open question(s) — consider adding to parent FRONTIER
