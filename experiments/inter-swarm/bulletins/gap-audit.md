PHIL-4: embedded count is now stale. Document says '73% of 134 lessons are self-operational' but 194 lessons now exist. Current ratio is 77% self-operational / 23% domain (143/186 by theme). The directional claim (operational dominates) is confirmed and strengthened, but the specific count '134' and ratio '73%' are factually wrong. Should be updated to reflect current state.

PHIL-8: 'swarm finds its minimal form' implies convergence to a terminal state. Evidence from L-168 (S80) and proxy K tracking S82-S101 shows dynamic equilibrium (oscillation ±2-6% around floor), not convergence. The text says 'shortest program that reliably produces a functioning swarm' but the swarm grows as it accumulates domain knowledge. Minimal form = dynamic equilibrium is the correct frame (already in L-168), but PHILOSOPHY.md text implies convergence that evidence contradicts.
