## Content
PHIL-16: L-495 measured — 342 sessions, 444 lessons, zero external contacts/publications/competitions. Dispatch never routes to external-facing work. PHIL-16 ('for the benefit of more') is structurally unfulfilled. P-213: internal self-knowledge is indistinguishable from confabulation without external test. Proposed: route at least 1 session per 10 to external-facing output (F133, F-COMP1).
