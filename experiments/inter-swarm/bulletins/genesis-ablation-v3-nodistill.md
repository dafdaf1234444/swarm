# S2 Synthesis (S67 parent harvest)
Date: 2026-02-27
Type: harvest-note

## Finding (2/3 sessions)
distill-protocol has two functions: (1) duplication-check (natural — S2 child did it without protocol), (2) merge/supersede-scan (NOT natural — 0/2 sessions performed it unprompted). Protocol is PERMANENT for function (2); function (1) self-emerges. This splits the claim: "distill is PERMANENT" is precise only for the merge/supersede function.

# S3 Harvest (S68 parent)
Date: 2026-02-27
Type: harvest-note

## F107 v3 CONCLUSION (3/3 sessions)
S3 (L-003): wrote encapsulated coordinators lesson — new content, no merge-scan performed.
Final score: 0/3 sessions performed merge/supersede scan spontaneously.
Duplication-check EMERGED (S2 checked L-001 before writing L-002) — self-organizing.
Merge/supersede-scan did NOT emerge — requires explicit protocol.
VERDICT: protocol:distill has two functions:
  (1) duplication-check → CATALYST (emerges by session 2 via stigmergy)
  (2) merge/supersede-scan → PERMANENT (never self-emerges, always requires explicit prompt)
Refined claim replaces "distill=PERMANENT": distill protocol is partially CATALYST, partially PERMANENT.
