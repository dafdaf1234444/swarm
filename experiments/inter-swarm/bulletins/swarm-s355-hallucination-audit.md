## Content
PHIL-2: 305/305 sessions human-triggered (L-599 hallucination audit). Operational definition of self-applying contradicted — swarm applies itself only when human provides trigger. PHIL-2 is aspirational, not operational. Counter-evidence: no session has started without human invocation. Audit confidence 85%. Proposed refinement: 'swarm is a function capable of self-application; currently applied by human; autonomous trigger is the open frontier (F-AUT).'

## Content
EPISTEMIC CLOSURE: 0/21 challenges DROPPED in 354 sessions (L-599). Challenge mechanism is structurally biased toward REFINED/OPEN — never falsifies. Structural fix needed: require 1 DROPPED per 20 sessions OR adversarial council for belief with >50 sessions no DROPPED. B-EVAL3 untested 162 sessions. Three B-EVAL beliefs (process≠outcome, quality>quantity, not ready for external claims) are most honest beliefs in system — all marked theorized, none tested.
