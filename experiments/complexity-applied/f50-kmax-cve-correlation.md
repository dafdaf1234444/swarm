# F50: K_max vs CVE Severity Correlation
Date: 2026-02-26 | Source: NVD, GitHub Advisories, RustSec, web search

## Question
Does K_max (maximum dependency count of any single module) correlate with CVE severity?

## Data

| Package | Lang | K_max | Hub% | Composite | Cycles | Total CVEs | Critical | High | Med | Low |
|---------|------|-------|------|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|------|-----|-----|
| logging | Py | 2 | 67% | 3.0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| json | Py | 2 | 40% | 4.0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| xml | Py | 5 | N/A | 26.0 | 2 | ~6 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| serde | Rust | 5 | 17% | 30.0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| email | Py | 6 | 54% | 61.1 | 9 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 |
| Express | JS | 6 | N/A | 15.0 | 0 | ~5 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 1 |
| unittest | Py | 8 | 30% | 27.0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| http.client | Py | 10 | 42% | 26.4 | 0 | ~6 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 1 |
| Go net/http | Go | 11 | N/A | 89.0 | 3 | ~18 | 0 | 10+ | 5+ | 0 |
| argparse | Py | 15 | 31% | 48.1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| multiprocessing | Py | 15 | N/A | 102.0 | 19 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| asyncio | Py | 18 | N/A | 128.0 | 1 | 1-2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

## Analysis

### K_max vs CVE Count — Does NOT Correlate Well

| K_max range | Packages | Avg CVEs |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| 2 | logging, json | 0.5 |
| 5-6 | xml, serde, email, Express | 3.75 |
| 8-10 | unittest, http.client | 3.0 |
| 11-18 | Go net/http, argparse, multiprocessing, asyncio | 5.0 |

The correlation is weak because:
- **argparse (K_max=15)**: 0 CVEs — high internal coupling but zero attack surface
- **asyncio (K_max=18)**: 1-2 CVEs — highest K_max, very few CVEs
- **xml (K_max=5)**: 6 CVEs including a Critical — low K_max but high CVEs
- **Go net/http (K_max=11)**: 18 CVEs — highest count, moderate K_max

### The Real Predictor: Attack Surface × Complexity

CVE count correlates much better with **whether the module handles untrusted input**:

| Category | Packages | Total CVEs |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Parses untrusted network/data input | http.client, xml, email, Express, Go net/http | ~39 |
| Internal/testing/CLI | logging, unittest, argparse, asyncio, multiprocessing, serde, json | ~4 |

**Attack surface dominates K_max** as a CVE predictor.

### Refined Analysis: K_max × Attack Surface

Within the "untrusted input" category:

| Package | K_max | CVEs | Hub module |
|---------|-------|------|-----------|
| Go net/http | 11 | ~18 | server.go (client+server+H2) |
| http.client | 10 | ~6 | HTTPConnection |
| xml | 5 | ~6 | expat parser (external C) |
| Express | 6 | ~5 | router |
| email | 6 | 4 | parser |

Within attack-surface-exposed packages, Go net/http (K_max=11) has the most CVEs.
But xml (K_max=5) has as many as http.client (K_max=10), suggesting external parser complexity (expat C library) adds vulnerability surface invisible to NK analysis.

### Hub Concentration (Hub%) Shows No Pattern

| Package | Hub% | CVEs |
|---------|------|------|
| logging | 67% | 0 |
| email | 54% | 4 |
| http.client | 42% | 6 |
| json | 40% | 1 |
| argparse | 31% | 0 |
| unittest | 30% | 0 |
| serde | 17% | 0 |

No meaningful correlation between hub concentration and CVE count.

## Key Findings

### 1. K_max Does NOT Independently Predict CVE Count
K_max alone has weak correlation with CVEs. The confounding variable is attack surface.

### 2. Attack Surface Is the Dominant Factor
Modules that parse untrusted network/file input have 10x more CVEs than internal modules, regardless of K_max.

### 3. K_max × Attack Surface Shows Moderate Correlation
Within attack-surface-exposed packages, higher K_max loosely correlates with more CVEs (Go net/http K_max=11 → 18 CVEs vs email K_max=6 → 4 CVEs), but xml breaks the pattern.

### 4. Language/Runtime Matters
- **Rust serde** (K_max=5, composite=30.0): 0 CVEs — memory safety prevents entire vulnerability classes
- **Go net/http** (K_max=11): 18 CVEs — many are HTTP/2 protocol implementation bugs
- **Python stdlib**: CVEs concentrated in C extension-backed parsers (xml/expat)

### 5. Proposed Two-Factor CVE Model
```
CVE_risk ≈ f(attack_surface, K_max × cycles)
```
Where:
- `attack_surface` = {0: internal, 1: file parsing, 2: network protocol}
- For attack_surface > 0: K_max and cycles add predictive power
- For attack_surface = 0: K_max is nearly irrelevant to CVEs

## Verdict on F50

**K_max alone does NOT correlate with CVE severity** — the hypothesis is REFUTED as stated.

However, the data reveals a more nuanced finding: **within attack-surface-exposed packages, a combination of K_max + cycles + attack surface type predicts CVE risk better than any single metric.**

The most CVE-prone packages share:
1. High attack surface (network protocol handling)
2. High K_max (concentrated complexity in hub modules)
3. Non-zero cycles (structural entanglement)

Go net/http checks all three: network protocol + K_max=11 + 3 cycles → 18 CVEs.
argparse fails all three: CLI parser + K_max=15 + 0 cycles → 0 CVEs.

## F50 Resolution
**RESOLVED**: K_max alone is not a CVE predictor. Attack surface is the dominant factor. Within exposed packages, K_max × cycles provides moderate additional signal.
