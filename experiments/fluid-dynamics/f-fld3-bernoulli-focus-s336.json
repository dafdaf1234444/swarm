  "paradox_explanation": "The 'domains mentioned in session notes' proxy is confounded with session size/activity. Highly productive sessions naturally mention more domains because they DO more — not because breadth causes productivity. This is a measurement selection artifact.",
  "reframing": "Bernoulli applies at a FINER granularity than session-level domain count. The correct analogy: within a session, scope narrowing (fewer open tasks, tighter focus window) increases per-task throughput. F-EVO1 r=-0.835 used scope cluster count over S184-S189, a tighter signal.",

  "implication": "Bernoulli is supported by F-EVO1 (r=-0.835) at scope-cluster level, not refuted. The F-FLD3 counter-signal reveals that domain breadth is a SIZE proxy, not a FOCUS proxy. Need within-session scope tightness metric.",
