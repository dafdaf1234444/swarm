    "interpretation": "Positive slope confirms fine-scale (T4) accumulation dominates — consistent with cascade direction. But slope 0.619 < 1.667 suggests weaker-than-Kolmogorov concentration at fine scale.",

  },
  "key_finding": "Token cascade is NOT smooth — T4 (tools) is a super-accumulator, not a dissipation sink. maintenance.py alone = 28,246t = 47% of total. This breaks the analogy: in Kolmogorov cascade, small scales dissipate energy. In swarm, T4 ACCUMULATES rather than dissipates — suggesting tools are a pathological sink, not a natural cascade endpoint.",
  "verdict": "PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED: cascade direction (fine scale accumulates) is correct, but T4 is an absorbing state rather than a dissipation channel. Implication: tools require periodic compaction analogous to turbulent energy injection reversal.",
  "actionable_implication": "Tools at T4 need active compaction — they are not self-limiting like viscous dissipation. Adding a tools-tier size limit (analogous to Kolmogorov microscale cutoff) would prevent budget runaway.",
