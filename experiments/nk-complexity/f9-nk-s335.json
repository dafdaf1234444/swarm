  "diff": "K_avg rose slightly to 1.5611 from 1.5452 at N=398 (N grew to 401 organically). Sink fraction held at ~39% — new lessons arriving as sinks faster than citation sprints close the gap. This confirms the structural tension: quality gate prevents outgoing orphans but has no control over incoming orphans. Protocol-level NK analysis was not previously attempted — revealed K_avg=4.17 (full-mesh) for bridge files and K_avg=2.86 (high-coupling) for governance authority chain, both with detectable cycles.",
