  "diff": "Predicted K_avg>1.85, got 1.7869 (missed by 0.063). Predicted acceleration, got plateau with slight decline. L-492 'acceleration' claim was measured pre-correction — post-correction the trend is plateau at ~1.78 with ±0.02 fluctuations. Hub and Gini z-scores weakened slightly, not strengthened. Sinks matched (34% vs <35%). Key finding: recent DOMEX/council lessons cite fewer peers (1.58 vs 1.79 avg), pulling K_avg down.",
  "analysis": {
    "plateau_hypothesis": "K_avg is bounded near 1.78 post-correction. The pre-correction series showed acceleration due to cache staleness inflating edge counts (L-510). True K_avg has been relatively stable since N≈445.",
    "citation_sparse_recent_lessons": "19 new lessons contributed only 30 edges (1.58/lesson). Hypothesis: meta-focused and council-generated lessons are more self-contained, with fewer cross-domain citations. Expert DOMEX lanes produce domain-specific lessons that cite within their domain, creating fewer inter-domain edges.",

Isolation z=0.887 not significant — uncited lesson fraction (34%) is consistent with random expectation.",
