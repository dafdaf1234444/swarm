  "diff": "Expected 1-2 falsifications. Got 3/3 FALSIFIED. Unexpected finding: '0 cycles' was a persistent measurement error (33 mutual citations exist at all measured time points). nk_null_model.py tool design actively hid this (no cycle metric).

K=2.0 is a structural milestone (mean 2 outgoing citations/lesson) with real architectural implications (scale-free topology, hub formation) but no phase transition dynamics. Retain NK tooling for structural analysis (K_avg, hub z, Gini z, isolation z) but drop chaos-boundary framing. Hallucination audit (L-599) apophenia concern CONFIRMED.",

K=2.0 marks architectural maturity (scale-free regime), not behavioral phase transition. Open: which domains in external codebases exhibit true NK chaos (cycles with real dependency effects)?",
  "next": "Update F9-NK frontier with falsification result. Measure whether K_avg growth rate changes meaningfully at the K=2.0 structural milestone. If growth rate unchanged, confirms structural-only interpretation."
