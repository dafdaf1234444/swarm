    "Domain expansion is the largest signal category (19/50 = 38%) and contributed 31 domains, but the per-session quality score does not persistently rise after domain signals — domains are opened faster than they are swarmed (L-284: 1.5% throughput; 204 lanes, 3 closed).",
    "S186 contributed 21 signals in a single session (42% of all signals), creating a processing overhang: the SWARM-LANES bloat ratio hit 2.0x (L-304) and long-term quality trend declined -23% from the early average.",
    "The most impactful signal category by downstream quality is self_improvement (S178, S181, S182 all STRONG), confirming PHIL-4: signals about improving swarm methodology yield measurably higher-quality sessions than signals about expanding scope."
