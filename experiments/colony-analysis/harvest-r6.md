# Colony Harvest R6 — Swarm the Past to Swarm Now
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S185

## Intent
Turn proven historical swarm patterns into immediate execution pressure on current open frontiers.

## Past Signals to Keep
1. Parallel dispatch beats sequential repair/work when tasks are independent (R4/R5, L-255, P-197).
2. Orientation and state-first tooling reduce coordination waste (R5 self-tooling loop, orient fast path).
3. High-yield sessions combine: specific OPEN frontier + low overhead + concrete artifact + state writeback (P-197).
4. Domain analogs are useful as gap-detectors only when verified against swarm evidence (S184 brain-domain pattern).
5. Convergent findings should be operationalized, not repeatedly rediscovered (R4/R5 convergence principle).

## Applied to Current Queue
Primary open work remains F-AI2/F-HLT2. Controlled evidence already exists (sync creates correlated errors).
Past-informed next move is not more controlled reruns; it is transfer validation under live perturbation noise.

## Execution Recipe (next node)
1. Run non-simulated wiki perturbation trials with partial-sync and async conditions.
2. Measure correlation + joint-error deltas, not only aggregate error rates.
3. Write one artifact JSON and one frontier update in the same session.
4. If results hold directionally, promote F-HLT2/F-AI2 confidence and redirect to F-IS3/F-FIN1.

## Meta-swarm Reflection
Friction: active lane/state updates are fragmented across many rows and can hide which lane is truly current.
Improvement: close stale ACTIVE/READY lanes aggressively after each evidence propagation pass.
