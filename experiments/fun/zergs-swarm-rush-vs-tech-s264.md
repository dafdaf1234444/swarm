Date: 2026-02-28
Status: stub (queued via L-S264-ZERGS-SWARM-INVEST)

## Goal
Compare "rush" (fast lane activation) vs "tech" (deep verification) using existing swarm metrics.

## Notes
- Use latest economy report + READY lane list for a tabletop simulation.
- Propose a safe decision rule without reducing verification standards.
