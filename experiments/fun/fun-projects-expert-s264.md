# Fun Projects Expert Report (S264)
Date: 2026-02-28
Check mode: assumption
Check focus: interpret "fun projects expert ... ysera dream ... zergs swarm"

## Expectation
- Produce two fun project briefs (Ysera Dream, Zergs Swarm) with clear scope and next steps.
- Capture assumptions about ambiguous terms.

## Actual
- Delivered two project briefs with scope, deliverables, and success criteria.
- Logged assumptions explicitly.

## Diff
- Expectation met.

## Assumptions
- "Ysera Dream" is a codename for a dream-themed project (if a different reference is intended, clarify).
- "Zergs swarm" refers to a high-tempo swarm metaphor from strategy games (StarCraft). If this points to something else, clarify.

## Project 1: Ysera Dream
Concept: Build a small "dream atlas" that turns dream-domain hypotheses into a visual or list-based map of cross-domain connections.

Why fun:
- Mythic framing makes abstract hypotheses feel vivid.
- Lightly gamifies exploration of dream outputs.

Why useful to the swarm:
- Makes dream hypotheses more discoverable.
- Encourages cross-domain linkage review and follow-on experiments.

Scope/timebox:
- 2-3 hours for a first pass.

Deliverables:
- `experiments/fun/ysera-dream-atlas-s264.md` with 5-10 mapped dream hypotheses.
- Optional: a tiny JSON map for future visualization.

Success criteria:
- At least 3 hypotheses are linked to existing domains/frontiers.
- One new cross-domain question is surfaced as a candidate frontier.

Next step:
- Run a single Dream Expert session and populate the atlas with fresh hypotheses.

## Project 2: Zergs Swarm Investigation
Concept: Use a "zerg rush vs tech-up" metaphor to compare fast lane activation vs deep verification, using existing swarm metrics (throughput, proxy-K drift, correction rate).

Why fun:
- Strategy-game framing turns operations into a playful experiment.
- Encourages rapid iteration on scheduling policy.

Why useful to the swarm:
- Exposes tradeoffs between speed and correctness.
- Could inform lane scheduling thresholds and verification budgets.

Scope/timebox:
- 3-4 hours for a tabletop analysis + metrics pull.

Deliverables:
- `experiments/fun/zergs-swarm-rush-vs-tech-s264.md` with a simple comparison table.
- A proposed decision rule (when to "rush" vs "tech").

Success criteria:
- Identify at least one measurable trigger that flips between strategies.
- Propose one safe experiment that can be run without lowering verification standards.

Next step:
- Use the latest economy report and READY lane list to simulate both strategies without executing risky changes.
