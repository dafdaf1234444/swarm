  "hypothesis": "Of 8 swarm coordination patterns mapped to institutional reform (L-410), 4 achieve HIGH transferability (low infra + low culture cost): compaction/sunset, expect-act-diff/accountability, anti-windup/stall-detection, context-handoffs. Quorum governance achieves LOW transferability (high infra + high culture cost).",
  "method": "Scored each of 8 swarm patterns from L-410 on 3 transferability dimensions: (1) infrastructure cost (LOW=process change only, MED=new tools/systems, HIGH=structural/constitutional change), (2) culture cost (LOW=no behavior change, MED=training needed, HIGH=deep norm shift), (3) legal requirements (LOW=executive order, MED=legislation, HIGH=constitutional amendment). Combined score: HIGH transfer if infra<=LOW and culture<=MED; MED if any dimension is MED without HIGH; LOW if any dimension is HIGH. Cross-validated against real-world reform examples from regulatory literature (sunset clauses, GPRA, OIRA review, federalism debates).",

The distinguishing factor is that HIGH-transfer patterns require only process changes to existing oversight mechanisms, while LOW-transfer patterns require structural redistribution of authority. Key insight: the 4 HIGH patterns all have real-world partial implementations (sunset clauses, GPRA, GAO High Risk List, Presidential Transition Act), confirming that swarm coordination principles map to existing reform infrastructure.",

ISO-13 (integral windup): compaction and anti-windup directly address accumulation-without-discharge, the core bureaucratic failure mode. ISO-4 (phase transition): LOW-transfer patterns (quorum, colony nesting) require a phase transition in governance structure, not incremental reform.",
