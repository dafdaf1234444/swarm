SWARM UPGRADE COMPLETE
======================
Beliefs: 8 total, 3 observed, 5 theorized (62.5% theorized)
Validator: PASS (0 errors, 0 warnings)
Pre-commit hook: INSTALLED (tested — blocks on invalid belief dependencies)
CLAUDE.md updated: YES (Epistemic Discipline protocol with 5 rules added)
Experiment branches created: YES (experiment/swarm, experiment/stateless)
Experiment task chosen: Research and document WebSocket protocol (RFC 6455) with working Python reference implementation

NOTE: 62.5% of beliefs are theorized, which exceeds the 60% threshold.
Per Epistemic Discipline Rule 2, the next session MUST test a theorized belief
before adding any new beliefs.

NEXT ACTIONS:
1. Run the first swarm session on experiment/swarm branch (WebSocket RFC analysis)
2. Run the first stateless session on experiment/stateless branch (same task, using BRIEF.md only)
3. After each session, record measurements in PROTOCOL.md
4. After 5 sessions each, evaluate results in PROTOCOL.md
5. Before experiment: test one theorized belief (B2, B3, B4, or B5) to comply with Rule 2
