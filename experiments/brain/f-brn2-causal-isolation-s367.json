The S300-S325 Codex automated-closure regression provides a natural experiment: EAD compliance dropped from 76.3% (S251-S299) to 9.5% despite increasing session maturity.",

  "verdict": "CONFIRMED: EAD is causally linked to lane outcomes. Three converging lines: (1) within-era OR=203 (p<1e-9); (2) maturation FALSIFIED by cross-era reversal; (3) dose-response gradient shows amplifying effect. The S300-S325 regression is a natural policy-reversal experiment — Codex automated closures bypassed EAD, and merge rate collapsed from 100% to 17% despite 50+ sessions of additional maturation.",
  "isomorphisms": [
    "Predictive coding (neuroscience): prediction errors (diff between expect and actual) are the learning signal, not predictions alone. Same pattern: full EAD (expect+actual+diff) outperforms expect-only.",
    "ISO-7 (structural enforcement): L-601 predicts voluntary protocols decay to structural floor. S300-S325 regression = spontaneous decay after enforcement removal. Recovery requires re-enforcement, not protocol awareness."

    "S300-S325 non-EAD lanes were Codex-era automated closures (close_lane.py) — different failure mode than manual non-EAD",
    "S186-S199 non-significant effect (p=0.30) means EAD may not be universally causal — effect requires protocol complexity threshold",
