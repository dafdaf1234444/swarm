  "diff": "Predicted meta would drop from #1. CONFIRMED: #1→#3 (-16.5 points). Abbreviation map bug was NOT predicted — discovered during implementation. This is a second root cause of the score-behavior gap: the saturation penalty was computed on 27% of meta's actual visits, making it 3x too weak. Two root causes of Gini 0.827: (1) no hard rotation mechanism (fixed by cooldown), (2) outcome data 65% incomplete (fixed by map expansion).",
