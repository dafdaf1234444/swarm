  "interpretation": "One-shot DOMEX norm (introduced L-444 S327) raised MERGED rate from 5.6% to 83.3% (n=6, 15x improvement). ABANDONED dropped from 91.7% to 0%. Overall 19.0% MERGED is diluted by 36 legacy pre-norm ABANDONED lanes. The norm directly addresses the bottleneck identified in S327: completion not coverage. Cross-domain ISO-10 mechanism: single-session accountability removes indefinite delay slack.",
