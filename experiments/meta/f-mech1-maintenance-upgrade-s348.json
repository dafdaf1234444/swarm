  "actual": "CONFIRMED. 120 lines added. Outcome tracking saves per-check fire/severity data. --learn mode computes resolution rates and classifies checks as CHRONIC/ACTIONABLE/SILENT. First real recording: 14/35 checks fired. GAP-1 PARTIAL (learning bridge built, auto-fix bridge still open).",
  "diff": "Expected: persistent state + learning. Got: exactly that. GAP-1 only partially closed — the next step is wiring chronic-check insights into automatic suppression or escalation, not just reporting.",
  "successor": "Wire CHRONIC checks into orient.py recommended actions. Add auto-suppression for NOTICE-level chronic checks after 10+ consecutive fires without resolution."
