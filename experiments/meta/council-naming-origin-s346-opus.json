  "question": "Why did the human name this system 'swarm'?",
  "check_mode": "assumption",
  "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
  "method": "5-domain expert council (linguistics, philosophy, psychology, meta, evolution), parallel independent investigation",
  "expect": "5 domains independently hypothesize; 3+ convergent; 2+ testable; novel finding beyond GENESIS.md",
  "actual": "5/5 convergent on core hypothesis. 4 testable predictions. 5 novel findings beyond GENESIS.md §3. Second council (different composition from concurrent S346 sonnet council) produced complementary convergence.",
  "diff": "Convergence stronger than expected (5/5 vs 3+). Novel findings richer: four-role stack, niche construction, grammatical inevitability, performative utterance, regulatory gene were all unanticipated. Combined with concurrent council: 10/10 cross-model convergence.",
