    "The 64% gap = signals that produce behavioral change but no searchable/durable knowledge node",
    "Paragraph-format signals (richer, authored) encode canonically at 67% vs 36% for table rows",
    "High-specificity signals ('swarm competitions for humanity') → rich encoding; bare 'swarm' → file-ref only — expected and appropriate",

    "Per-signal prompt: after encoding, ask 'does this warrant a lesson or principle?' before logging",
    "Periodic pattern promotion: scan 'Applied to' entries for reusable patterns → elevate to L/P",
