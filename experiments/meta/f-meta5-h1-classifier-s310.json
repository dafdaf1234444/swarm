The structural tension is between B8 as 'self-balancing' (challenged by growth from 8\u219237) vs B8 as 'generative' (supported by 105 resolutions). Cross-belief: B8 interacts with convergence guarantee (Knaster-Tarski LFP) and F105 (online compaction). Partial resolution: B8 should be annotated 'net generative with resolution pressure' not 'self-sustaining' (which implies balance).",
