  "method": "Structural analysis: enumerate coherence failure modes, map each to a minimal protocol component, verify by examining sessions where coherence failed (L-526, L-517, L-498, L-572). Check if each component is necessary and sufficient.",
  "expect": "Identify 3-7 components, all necessary. Expect protocol_handshake and state_vector to be in the set.",
  "actual": "Exactly 5 components identified. All necessary (removing any maps to a documented failure mode). Together they are sufficient (any handoff satisfying all 5 has maintained coherence in practice).",
