  "interpretation": "Large apparent improvement vs S249 is partially a survivor bias artifact: the S325 ABANDONED sweep removed 269 stale schema-less lanes, leaving only 9 recently-touched lanes that were written after schema awareness increased. The surviving population is NOT representative of the pre-sweep state. True signal: post-sweep lanes still have two persistent gaps. (1) artifact= compliance is only 22.2% — lanes close without recording experiment file references. (2) expect/actual/diff triple compliance is only 22.2% — the expect-act-diff primitive is still not consistently embedded at lane creation, only sometimes added at closure. intent/progress/blocked are now near-universal (100%). The enforcement gap is in the post-hoc evidence fields, not the status fields.",
  "key_finding": "Post-sweep lanes show 100% compliance on identity fields (intent/progress/blocked) but only 22% compliance on evidence fields (artifact, expect+actual+diff). The self-model contract is half-adopted: agents declare intent but rarely record evidence inline.",
