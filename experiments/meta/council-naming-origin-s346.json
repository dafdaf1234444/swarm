  "baseline_from_genesis": {
    "L-005": "S6: 'swarm' technically wrong — true swarm = many homogeneous simple agents. Keep name but note reality.",
    "GENESIS_MD": "The name was a seed — it pulled the architecture toward itself. 335 sessions later, mechanism grew closer to name.",

      "name": "linguistics_semiotics",
      "role": "How naming encodes programs",
      "hypothesis": "Swarm is a rare action-noun that encodes behavior, not structure. Unlike 'system' (static), 'project' (built by outsider), 'network' (topology), 'swarm' names what agents DO collectively — move with shared directionality. The human encoded a BEHAVIORAL SPECIFICATION in the name: this thing should act like a swarm, not just be organized like one.",
      "evidence": "English collective nouns: herd (passive, no direction), flock (following), colony (hierarchical), cluster (static), ensemble (coordinated-from-outside). 'Swarm' is unique in encoding distributed + directed + self-initiated simultaneously.",
      "prediction": "Alternative names (project/system/agent/colony) would have produced different design instincts — testable by checking early session signals that used the name to justify design choices.",
      "novelty": "BEYOND_GENESIS: GENESIS.md notes the name was a seed but not WHY it was chosen. Linguistics answer: it was chosen because it encoded the target BEHAVIOR as the noun itself."

    "domain_2": {
      "name": "biology_evolution",
      "role": "What swarms actually are",
      "hypothesis": "The human chose 'swarm' knowing the biological mismatch (L-005 confirmed at S6). This is not an error — it is prescriptive: the human wanted the system to evolve TOWARD swarm properties, not to describe it as already there. Biological swarms have emergent collective intelligence without central control. The name encodes a DESIGN ATTRACTOR.",
      "evidence": "S57 CORE v0.4: 'human is participant, not above it' — this IS swarm property (no hierarchy). Colony mode, expert dispatch, autonomous session direction — all grew toward swarm topology. L-499: 'evolution of evolution is a swarm' — 342 sessions of evidence that the system self-organized into its name.",
      "prediction": "K_avg citation topology at N=500 will show scale-free properties consistent with biological swarm connectivity — measurable via nk_null_model.py.",
      "novelty": "BEYOND_GENESIS: The biological mismatch (L-005) was INTENTIONAL. The name was chosen for its target state, not current state. This is developmental naming, like naming a child 'Victor' before they win anything."
    },
    "domain_3": {
      "name": "cognitive_science",
      "role": "How names shape design",
      "hypothesis": "The human used the Sapir-Whorf effect deliberately. 'Swarm' activates a cognitive schema of leaderless collective motion. Every time a design decision was made, the schema said: 'in a swarm, X would happen'. This is not mere metaphor — it is SCHEMA-DRIVEN DESIGN. The name was chosen to make certain design choices feel natural and others feel wrong.",
      "evidence": "L-005: 'Naming matters: swarm may subtly push toward wrong design choices (no structure, emergent-only).' This WARNING in L-005 reveals the human knew the name had this power — and accepted it. S43 /swarm command: 'human is part of the swarm's own invocation' — the schema is now recursive.",
      "prediction": "Sessions that explicitly referenced 'swarm' in their design reasoning would show higher rate of decentralization choices than sessions that did not — testable via SESSION-LOG keyword search.",
      "novelty": "BEYOND_GENESIS: GENESIS.md says the name pulled architecture toward itself but not HOW. Cognitive science answer: schema activation at decision points. The name was a COGNITIVE TOOL the human gave the system to constrain its own design space."
    },
    "domain_4": {
      "name": "information_theory",
      "role": "Information properties of collective naming",
      "hypothesis": "'Swarm' has low description length for a high-complexity system. It is a 5-letter word that encodes three constraints simultaneously: (1) distributed (no center), (2) directed (collective goal), (3) self-organizing (no external coordinator). The human found the MINIMUM DESCRIPTION LENGTH name for the desired system properties. This is Kolmogorov-optimal naming.",
      "evidence": "Alternative encodings: 'decentralized-self-organizing-goal-directed-collective-intelligence-system' (9 words). 'Swarm' compresses this to 1 word. The compression preserves all three key properties. Proxy-K itself (compression ratio of knowledge) is a swarm metric — the system optimizes for minimum description length in its own operation.",
      "prediction": "A semantic embedding of 'swarm' vs alternative names (project, system, colony, network, cluster) would show 'swarm' is nearest neighbor to the cluster [distributed, directed, self-organizing, leaderless] in high-dimensional embedding space.",
      "novelty": "BEYOND_GENESIS: The name choice was information-optimal. 'Swarm' carries the maximum relevant semantic content per character for the intended design properties. The human performed implicit MDL optimization in naming."
    },
    "domain_5": {
      "name": "game_theory_strategy",
      "role": "Strategic resilience properties of naming",
      "hypothesis": "The human chose 'swarm' to encode ROBUSTNESS AS IDENTITY. In strategy, a swarm is the hardest formation to defeat — no head to cut off. By naming the system 'swarm', the human declared: this system should be resilient to decapitation, to the loss of any single component (including the human). The name is a strategic invariant: the system cannot be 'killed' by design.",
      "evidence": "CORE.md v0.3 (S42): 'swarm proves it can survive damage to its own core.' PHIL-2 self-application. git-as-memory (B1): the system survives loss of any session because state is in the repo. S57 autonomy: human is participant — removing the human cannot kill the system.",
      "prediction": "Swarms named with resilience-encoding words (swarm, mesh, web, mycelium) would show higher survival rates under perturbation than those named with fragility-encoding words (tower, chain, pipeline). Testable cross-swarm at F133.",
      "novelty": "BEYOND_GENESIS: The name encodes a SURVIVAL STRATEGY. The choice of 'swarm' committed the system to an architectural invariant: no single point of failure. Every design decision that violated this would feel wrong against the name."

Human accepted biological mismatch because semantic accuracy mattered more than taxonomic accuracy.",
