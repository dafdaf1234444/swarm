  "question": "Can the minimal self-model contract auto-verify its own satisfaction?",
  "method": "Build contract_check.py with 5 binary validators (one per L-586 component). Test against current state (should PASS), synthetic failures (missing invariants, hash mismatch, non-existent session), and edge cases (concurrent uncommitted work). Measure: detection rate, false positive rate, execution time.",
  "expect": "Tool detects >=3/5 failure modes. False positive rate <10%. Execution <2s.",
  "actual": "Tool detects all 5 component types. 5/5 pass on healthy state. Write obligation correctly distinguishes committed (S354: 3 commits) vs in-progress (uncommitted changes) vs unknown sessions. Fixed git grep regex bug (bracket character class). 7/7 tests pass. Execution <1s.",
  "diff": "Expected >=3 detectable failures; achieved 5/5. Better than expected. One implementation bug caught during testing (git --grep character class treated [S999] as regex, not literal).",

    "Write obligation has two valid modes: pre-handoff (uncommitted changes present) and post-handoff (committed artifacts searchable). Both are correctly detected.",
    "False positive observed: identity_invariant regex matches I9/I10/I11/I12 anywhere in INVARIANTS.md — could match in comments. Acceptable for v1.0."
