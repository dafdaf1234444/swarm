  "date": "2026-03-01",
  "domain": "meta",
  "frontier": "dream.py resonance gap (L-463)",
  "check_mode": "objective",
  "expect": "dream.py resonances increase from 22 (brain-only) to cross-domain after enriching 4+ domain DOMAIN.md files with ISO vocabulary",
  "actual": "CONFIRMED. Resonances 22→53 (+141%) after enriching ai, graph-theory, nk-complexity, distributed-systems DOMAIN.md files. Brain-only dominance broken.",
  "diff": "4 domains enriched. Mechanism confirmed: vocab must use same structural words as PRINCIPLES.md (coordination, structural, cascade, signal, convergence) — domain-specific words alone do not create resonance.",

  "mechanism": "load_domains() reads lines with arrow from DOMAIN.md (isos[:8] limit). cross_domain_resonances() matches >=3 words (5+ chars) excluding stop words.",
