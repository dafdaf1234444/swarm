  "check_mode": "objective",
  "expect": "Sessions with higher self-referential depth (DOMEX, councils, internal citations) produce 1.5x+ more lessons",
  "actual": "Directionally confirmed but weak: self-referential 1.26x, DOMEX 1.17x, council 1.15x. Small n per comparison.",
  "diff": "Effect sizes 25-50% smaller than predicted. Confounders: session length, concurrent sessions, era effects. Not a clean signal.",

  "interpretation": "Recursive self-application has a positive but modest effect on knowledge production. The bigger effect may be on knowledge QUALITY (self-referential lessons have higher citation density) rather than QUANTITY. The human signal may describe a ceiling effect: full self-application enables growth, partial self-application limits it. Testable: compare citation graph connectivity of DOMEX-era vs pre-DOMEX-era lessons.",
