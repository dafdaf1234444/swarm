  "question": "Where does authority and invariant drift appear across canonical and derivative protocol files?",
  "method": "Built drift_scanner.py to extract 14 required protocol blocks from SWARM.md/CORE.md, then check all 6 bridge files for presence. Also check MSC section sync and version-tracking metadata.",
  "expect": "Scanner identifies >=3 requirement gaps between canonical and derivative files",
  "actual": "Scanner found 2 drift categories: 1 HIGH (node-interaction missing from 4/6 bridges, ~260 sessions undetected), 5 LOW (version-tracking absent from 5/6 bridges). MSC sections 100% synchronized — no divergence. After fix: 0 HIGH drifts, coverage 89.9%→94.4%.",
  "diff": "Expected >=3 gaps, found 2 categories (1 HIGH + 1 LOW). The HIGH drift was more severe than expected (~260 sessions), but fewer categories than predicted. MSC sync was better than expected (100% identical). The tool is more valuable as ongoing monitor than one-shot audit.",
