Conflicts occur from same-file writes at density ≈ 0.006-0.058, far below 0.3. The threshold cannot protect against specific hot-file collisions.",

  "diff": "Prediction: P-081 would be challenged. Outcome: CONFIRMED challenged. Unexpected finding: threshold obsolescence is a scaling artifact — as repo grows, threshold becomes trivially satisfied while file-level collision risk remains.",
  "revised_principle": "P-081 revision: concurrent safety requires (1) per-file collision avoidance via specific git-add (not git add -A), (2) append-only CRDT patterns for shared hot files (SWARM-LANES.md, lessons). Density threshold is a coarse historical signal, not a real-time safety gate. Retain as maturation metric, remove as safety guarantee.",
  "challenge_resolution": "EXECUTED — P-081 status should be revised from PARTIALLY_OBSERVED to CHALLENGED (threshold insufficient); new principle P-231 needed: 'same-file write avoidance + CRDT patterns are the actual concurrent safety mechanism'"
