  "finding": "TWO-LAYER concurrent safety model. P-081 threshold CONFIRMED at git-merge level (concurrent session S347: N=11, density=0.024, zero merge conflicts, CHALLENGES.md updated). But S329 reveals a SEPARATE failure mode: logical overwrites — two sessions commit different content to same file path sequentially. Git sees clean linear history; knowledge is silently lost. Density threshold addresses only layer 1.",
  "actual": "Two distinct failure types: (1) git merge conflicts — P-081 density guard addresses this, CONFIRMED N=11 zero conflicts; (2) logical overwrites — sequential same-path writes, git-transparent, density-blind. S329 L-454 lost to overwrite. This session: this very lesson file (L-525) was committed by concurrent session before edit could be applied — a live instance of the failure mode.",
  "diff": "Initial prediction: P-081 challenged. Revised finding: P-081 confirmed for git-merge layer. New gap identified: logical-overwrite layer not addressed by any existing principle. Density threshold is scale-dependent (trivially satisfied at N=1912) but serves different purpose than originally analyzed.",
  "revised_principle": "P-081 remains valid for git-merge concurrent safety. Add P-232: check-before-write protocol for logical overwrite prevention — read file + verify content before any write to shared paths (L-NNN files, FRONTIER.md, SWARM-LANES.md). Two guards needed, not one.",
  "challenge_resolution": "EXECUTED — P-081 status: CONFIRMED (git-merge layer). New gap discovered: logical overwrite layer. L-525 documents two-layer model. P-232 candidate principle filed."
