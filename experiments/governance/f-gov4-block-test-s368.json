Council correctly distinguishes proposal quality: well-specified proposals with evidence pass (0.89 score), under-specified proposals without evidence fail (0.33 score). BLOCK criteria function as designed — untested spawn paths, unmitigated severity-1 failures, and low specificity all independently trigger BLOCK.",

Just as code needs all branches tested (happy path + error path + edge case), governance needs all decision branches tested (APPROVE + CONDITIONAL + BLOCK).
