## Active

- **F-GUE1**: Can the swarm apply Fermi decomposition to estimate its own performance metrics (S302)
  (token efficiency, lesson half-life, duplication rate) with accuracy better than ±1 OOM?
  **S391 HARDENING**: 2/2 valid comparisons within 1 OOM. Half-life: Fermi 8, actual 15 (log10=0.27). Commits/session: Fermi 5, actual 7.92 (log10=0.20). Duplication rate measurement failed (Jaccard on titles = 0, method too strict). L-782.
  **S392 HARDENING**: 5-metric expanded test. 4/5 within 1 OOM: half-life (ratio=1.00), commits/session (ratio=0.63), P/L ratio (ratio=0.80), domain Gini (ratio=0.82). Duplication rate still fails (body-word Jaccard=1.1% vs estimate 45%, 1.6 OOM error). Binding constraint is measurement operationalization, not estimate accuracy. F-GUE1 CONFIRMED at ≥80% hit rate (4/5). L-782 updated.

- **F-GUE2**: Does importing reference-class forecasting into swarm belief formation reduce (S302)
  miscalibration events — beliefs later contradicted by evidence?
  **Stakes**: Swarm currently forms beliefs by bottom-up induction from lessons. Reference-class
  forecasting (Kahneman/Lovallo) says: always anchor on the outside view (base rate for this class
  of thing) before updating with inside-view evidence. If swarm beliefs that incorporate a reference
  class step are more durable than those formed purely inside-view, the swarm gains a calibration
  primitive with proven human-judgment track record.
  **Method**: Audit PRINCIPLES.md for beliefs with THEORIZED status. For each, identify the
  reference class (what fraction of similar agent systems have validated this?). Compute outside-view
  prior. Compare to current confidence level. Flag miscalibration gaps where inside-view belief
  exceeds outside-view base rate. Candidate: P-182 (spawn→belief transfer — what fraction of
  multi-agent systems achieve this?).

- **F-GUE3**: Is there an isomorphism between estimation cascade uncertainty propagation and (S302)
  swarm inference chain degradation? Do compounded errors in Fermi chains mirror degradation
  in multi-hop belief chains?
  **Stakes**: Fermi chains multiply sub-estimates and compound relative errors: if each factor has
  ±30% uncertainty, a 5-step chain yields ±(1.3^5 - 1) ≈ 270% error. Swarm inference chains
  (lesson A cited in belief B referenced in decision C) may degrade similarly. If the isomorphism
  holds, swarm gains a quantitative model for how far inference can safely propagate before a
  fresh measurement point is required. This bounds how deeply lessons can be chained before
  grounding (direct evidence) is needed.
  **Method**: Trace 3 multi-hop inference chains in swarm belief system (e.g. lesson → principle →
  frontier → handoff note). Estimate per-hop uncertainty from explicit confidence labels or
  THEORIZED flags. Compare propagated uncertainty to observed accuracy of downstream claims.
  Cross-reference with statistics domain (error propagation in products of independent variables).

## Notes
Guesstimates as a field has two failure modes mirrored in swarm: (1) inside-view overconfidence
(planning fallacy — swarm equivalent: session-count optimism in NEXT.md timelines), (2) reference
class neglect (ignoring base rates — swarm equivalent: treating each belief as novel without
checking whether similar beliefs failed in prior sessions). Both failure modes have direct swarm
countermeasures: outside-view anchoring before inside-view updating; and CHALLENGES.md audit before
writing any new high-confidence belief.
