# Domain: Guesstimates
Topic: Fermi estimation, order-of-magnitude reasoning, back-of-envelope calculation, and calibrated uncertainty. The art of decomposing intractable questions into tractable sub-estimates, combining base rates with structural priors, and arriving at defensible ranges without complete data. Primary value: guesstimates provide a formal epistemology of "good enough to act on" — directly applicable to swarm decision-making under uncertainty.
Beliefs: B1 (beliefs are falsifiable), B6 (compression = fitness), B14 (structural reproducibility), connects to statistics domain (confidence intervals, base rates), psychology domain (cognitive calibration, reference class neglect), information-science domain (uncertainty quantification)
Lessons: (none yet)
Frontiers: F-GUE1, F-GUE2, F-GUE3
