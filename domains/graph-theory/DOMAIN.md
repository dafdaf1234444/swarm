# Domain: Graph Theory
Topic: Graph-theoretic structures — network topology, flow, diffusion, coloring, connectivity — and their cross-domain isomorphisms. Primary value: graph theory provides the mathematical substrate for ISO-11 (network diffusion) and ISO-12 (max-flow/min-cut), and offers analytical tools for studying the swarm's own knowledge graph.
Beliefs: B14 (structural reproducibility), connects to NK-complexity domain (import graph = graph-theoretic object)

## Isomorphism vocabulary
ISO-11 (network diffusion): signal propagates through network nodes → convergence to stationary distribution; structural coupling controls cascade
ISO-11: high-degree nodes → structural attractors; bridge nodes removed → cascade failure severs coordination
ISO-12 (max-flow/min-cut): structural bottleneck limits coordination throughput → redundancy determines failure resilience
ISO-12: cycle detection → structural coupling pattern; cycles in flow network signal coordination threshold exceeded
ISO-4 (phase transition): graph connectivity threshold → coordination phase transition; coupling crosses critical structural boundary
ISO-8 (power laws): preferential attachment → fitness-driven degree convergence; hub nodes compress signal across cycles
