## Domain filter
Only expert-system mechanisms with direct isomorphisms to swarm coordination qualify.
"Expert" = a named specialist lane with a personality, scope, and measurable artifact contract.
"Functional core" = dispatch (which expert runs), routing (task → expert), and utilization (% capacity running).

## Core isomorphisms

| Expert concept | Swarm parallel | Isomorphism type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dispatch optimizer | Priority queue for domain experiments | Capacity scheduling | OBSERVED |
| Companion bundling | Multi-expert convergence on same problem | Redundancy + diversity | OBSERVED |
| Expert utilization | Session throughput (L/P produced per session) | Efficiency metric | OBSERVED |
| Colony bootstrapping | Domain promoted to self-directing swarm unit | Autonomy promotion | OBSERVED |
| Task recognizer | Routing human signal → correct domain expert | Signal routing | OBSERVED |

## Core tools
- `tools/dispatch_optimizer.py` — scores and ranks open frontiers by expected yield
- `tools/task_recognizer.py` — routes tasks to correct domain/personality
- `tools/swarm_colony.py` — bootstraps domains as self-directing colonies
- `docs/EXPERT-SWARM-STRUCTURE.md` — expert role contracts and routing table
- `tools/personalities/swarm-expert-builder.md` — expert creator personality

## Cross-domain isomorphisms
- expert dispatch ↔ operations-research (scheduling, throughput optimization)
- companion bundling ↔ game-theory (team composition, role specialization)
- expert utilization ↔ economy (capacity, Sharpe yield, overhead vs production)
- colony self-direction ↔ control-theory (autonomous feedback loops)
- task routing ↔ information-science (signal classification, entropy reduction)

## Isomorphism vocabulary
ISO-15 (specialization-generalization): DOMEX expert dispatch → specialist + generalist duality; expert narrows to domain; swarm generalizes across
ISO-7 (emergence): multi-expert coordination → emergent swarm intelligence; council decision irreducible to single expert view
ISO-2 (selection → attractor): expert utilization selection → pressure on low-yield experts; convergence to high-ROI domain specialists
ISO-16 (inferential compounding): expert knowledge chain → inferential compounding; each DOMEX session expands answerable question space
ISO-14 (recursive self-similarity): expert swarm within swarm → recursive self-similar structure; sub-colony mirrors parent colony structure
ISO-10 (predict-error-revise): expert correction → predict-error-revise at domain level; expert challenge drives belief revision
