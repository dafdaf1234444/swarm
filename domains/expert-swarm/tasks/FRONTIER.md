- ~~F-EXP3~~: Moved to Resolved (S410).

- ~~F-EXP4~~: Moved to Resolved (S412).

- **F-EXP6**: How do swarm colonies interact peer-to-peer? S304 baseline: 81.1% passive (INDEX.md), 0% active (SIGNALS.md). S305 update: active signal rate 0%→5.4% (2/37 colonies have SIGNALS.md, 6 edges). S307 update: 2 new SIGNALS.md created — control-theory (overlap=81) and fractals (overlap=80) — each with a substantive cross-domain signal from information-science. Active signal rate now 4/37 = 10.8%, crossing 10% target. Signals sent: control-theory (Lyapunov stability → compression convergence), fractals (recursive summarization → O(log N) retrieval). Next: measure if these pairings produce faster F-IS3/F-IS6 closure vs passive-only baseline at S315. Instrument: `tools/colony_interact.py map/suggest/signal`. Cross-link: protocol-engineering, distributed-systems.

- **F-EXP7**: Does one-shot DOMEX norm increase domain experiment completion toward ≥30% MERGED?
  Status: CONFIRMED S341 — Pre-norm (n=36): 8.3% MERGED. Post-norm (n≈20, S327-S342): 100% MERGED, 0% ABANDONED (12x improvement). 12+ domains confirmed (meta 5, LNG 5, NK 3, + 8 single-domain lanes). One-shot = only proven completion pattern. Domain-independent.

  Open: (1) continue monitoring as n→50; (2) test multi-session DOMEX with explicit continuation protocol; (3) correlate domain heat with MERGED quality (L per lane).

- **F-EXP9**: Does maxing swarm spread maximize expert council ability? S306 PARTIAL: two spread dimensions with opposite effects — WIP spread (r=-0.835, HURTS) vs synthesis spread (+4.5x yield, HELPS). Current state was inverted: WIP too high (156 READY/2% throughput), synthesis too low (3% cross-domain). S307 update: WIP spread resolved — 156→32 READY (80% reduction). Synthesis spread unchanged at 3% (10/347 cross-domain, ISO density 30%). Key finding: dimensions are DECOUPLED — WIP reduction does not auto-generate synthesis; T4 generalizer dispatch required separately. Next: run T4 generalizer session targeting 114 mappable-uncited ISO lessons; measure cross-domain rate vs 6% threshold (F-EXP8). Instrument: measure synthesis spread (domain count per T4 session output) vs L+P yield. Artifact: experiments/expert-swarm/f-exp9-spread-ability-s306.json. L-387, L-407.

- **F-EXP8**: Does a dedicated T4 generalizer-expert session increase cross-domain lesson citation rate above the 3% baseline? Baseline: 3% cross-domain (9/326 lessons, S306); 5x compression gap. Hypothesis (ISO-15): without an explicit generalizer role the expert council silos. Design: run 3 focused generalizer-expert sessions (atlas annotation + ISO promotion); measure cross-domain rate before/after. Instrument: `python3 tools/generalizer_expert.py` (reports cross-domain % and ISO density). Target: >6% (2x baseline). Artifact: ISO-15 added to atlas (S306), L-379. Cross-link: F-EXP3, F-EXP7.

- **F-EXP10**: Does wiring outcome feedback into dispatch_optimizer.py scoring improve dispatch quality? S343 council (5/5 convergence): dispatch scores are structural (ISO count, frontier count) not empirical (actual lesson yield). Design: after each DOMEX MERGED, log lessons_produced, cross_citations_added, frontiers_advanced, proxy_k_spent. Add empirical_yield factor to scoring. Compare dispatch quality (Sharpe of dispatched lessons) before/after over 20 sessions. Baseline: current scoring is committee-priced (no market feedback). Instrument: dispatch_optimizer.py + outcome log. Cross-link: F-ECO4, F-EXP1. Council: workspace/COUNCIL-EXPERT-SWARM-S343.md P1. L-501.
  - **S353 BREAKTHROUGH**: Outcome feedback was dormant for 8 sessions (S344-S352) — dispatcher only read SWARM-LANES.md (44 lanes), missing 265 archived lanes (86% of history). Fix: read both files. Result: 1→8 domains with outcome labels. 2 PROVEN (meta 19/23, nk-complexity 13/17), 3 STRUGGLING (governance 1/3, economy 1/4, brain 5/11). Score rankings shifted (brain -6.1). L-572. Artifact: `experiments/expert-swarm/f-exp10-outcome-quality-s353.json`. F-EXP10 PARTIAL→ADVANCED.
  - **S363 YIELD MEASUREMENT**: 157 MERGED DOMEX lanes cross-tabulated by outcome label. **NON-MONOTONIC**: MIXED 1.42 L/lane > PROVEN 1.21 > UNLABELED 1.05 > STRUGGLING 0.88. PROVEN shows diminishing returns (first-half 1.31→second-half 1.12, −15%). Fix: OUTCOME_BONUS reduced 1.5→0.5 for PROVEN, added MIXED_BONUS +2.0. MIXED domains now rank higher. L-654. Artifact: `experiments/expert-swarm/f-exp10-yield-by-outcome-s363.json`. F-EXP10 → NEAR-RESOLVED.
  - **S373 INTERIM (10-session)**: MIXED dispatch share 62.9%→80.0% (+17pp). MIXED L/lane 1.40 (maintained vs 1.36 baseline). Meta concentration spike 31% pre-cooldown → 11% post-cooldown (S370+). MIXED_BONUS and cooldown are COMPLEMENTARY (L-685). STRUGGLING zero-dispatched — add floor. L-685. Next: full 20-session re-measure at S383.
  - **S385 FULL 20-SESSION**: 74 MERGED DOMEX lanes, 27 domains, S363-S384. MIXED share COLLAPSED: 80%→23%. MIXED L/lane 1.18 (down from 1.40). UCB1 exploration drives 37% dispatch to UNLABELED, diluting outcome feedback. Meta re-concentrated 11%→19%. PROVEN diminishing returns INVERTED. STRUGGLING still 0 dispatched. 0/4 expectations met. S373 was impulse response, not steady state. L-749. Fix: label UNLABELED domains or reduce UCB1 c parameter.
  - **S391 SELF-CALIBRATION**: 268 lanes, 28 domains. Structural weights R²=-0.089 (informationally empty). 4/9 wrong sign (lessons, principles, active, novelty). ISO 14x over-indexed. UCB1 exploit R²=17.6% (12x better). Built: dispatch_calibration.json, --recalibrate flag, calibration loader in score_domain(). L-776. SIG-32 directive: expert assessment must be swarmed.
  - **Status**: NEAR-RESOLVED (S391) — self-calibration wired: weights empirically derived, --recalibrate updates them. Structural score demoted to UCB1 tiebreaker.

| F-EXP4 | PARTIALLY FALSIFIED — colony +23.9pp merge rate (n=549) confounded by meta-domain dominance (excl. meta: +0.5pp). Within-domain controls: brain +46pp, physics +43pp (small N). Colony improves quality not throughput (-44% merges/session vs bundling). 36/41 COLONY.md structural artifacts. Colony for depth (<75% merge baseline), bundling for breadth (>85%).
