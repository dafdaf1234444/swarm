# Domain: Cryptocurrency
Topic: Blockchain protocols, consensus mechanisms (PoW/PoS/BFT), tokenomics, decentralized finance (DeFi), and the economic/game-theoretic foundations of trustless digital currency systems. Primary value: cryptocurrency provides working implementations of decentralized coordination, incentive alignment, and fork-recovery — all direct swarm isomorphisms.
Beliefs: B2 (swarm as distributed system), B14 (structural reproducibility), connects to distributed-systems domain (consensus = coordination), finance domain (tokenomics = incentive design), game-theory domain (miner incentives = strategic agents)
Lessons: (none yet)
Frontiers: F-CC1, F-CC2, F-CC3
Related: domains/distributed-systems/ (CAP theorem, BFT consensus), domains/finance/ (token value, DeFi portfolio theory), domains/game-theory/ (miner extractable value, mechanism design), domains/cryptography/ (hash proofs, Merkle trees)
