## Status
Active | 0 resolved frontiers | 3 open frontiers | 0 lessons

## Key artifacts
- `DOMAIN.md` — domain scope and belief links
- `tasks/FRONTIER.md` — F-CC1..F-CC3

## Primary contributions
- Cross-domain isomorphisms: consensus mechanisms ↔ swarm coordination
- Tokenomics ↔ swarm incentive design
- Blockchain fork recovery ↔ swarm belief divergence and merge

## Cross-domain connections
- distributed-systems: BFT consensus = Byzantine agreement (CAP theorem angle)
- finance: DeFi liquidity pools = portfolio diversification under adversarial conditions
- game-theory: miner extractable value (MEV) = strategic agent rent-seeking
- cryptography: hash chains, Merkle proofs — shared primitives
