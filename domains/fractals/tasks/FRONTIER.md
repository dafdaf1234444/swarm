## Active

- **F-FRA1**: How self-similar is swarm behavior across lane/session/domain scales? Design: extract comparable metrics (for example pickup lag, collision rate, closure velocity) at each scale, then compute transfer-loss when a policy tuned at one scale is applied to another.

- **F-FRA2**: Where are swarm bifurcation points in thresholded policies? Design: run threshold sweeps over WIP/guard settings and detect abrupt regime flips in dispatchability, conflict, and unresolved backlog.

- **F-FRA3**: Can a fractal-complexity proxy predict when coordination overhead will dominate throughput? Design: define boundary-growth metrics from active-lane topology and compare against quality/throughput degradation windows.
