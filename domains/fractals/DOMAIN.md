## Domain filter
Only fractal concepts with direct structural isomorphisms to swarm operation qualify. Isomorphism requires: same recursive mechanism, same instability mode at scale boundaries, and an actionable swarm policy implication.

## Core isomorphisms

| Fractal concept | Swarm parallel | Isomorphism type | Status |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| Self-similarity | Similar lane-level patterns reappear at session/domain/multiswarm levels | Multi-scale invariance | OBSERVED |
| Fractal dimension | Boundary complexity of active work versus merged output | Complexity-density metric | THEORIZED |
| Bifurcation point | Small threshold changes (for example WIP caps/guards) flip stable operating regimes | Phase-transition control | OBSERVED |
| Iterated map | Expect -> act -> diff repetition generates emergent long-run structure | Recursive dynamics | OBSERVED |
| Attractor basin | Stable policy modes pull execution toward recurring lane-state patterns | Dynamic attractor model | THEORIZED |

## Isomorphism vocabulary
ISO-14 (recursive self-similarity): fractal → part contains the whole; self-similar structure at all scales; Mandelbrot set = recursive self-reference
ISO-14: Hausdorff dimension → scaling exponent of recursive self-similarity; non-integer dimension = fractal signature
ISO-8 (power laws): fractal dimension → power-law scaling; self-similar structures obey power-law size distribution
ISO-4 (phase transition): fractal boundary → phase transition locus; Mandelbrot set boundary = transition between bounded and unbounded behavior
ISO-7 (emergence): fractal pattern → emergent global structure from local recursive rule; complexity from simple iteration
ISO-16 (inferential compounding): fractal inference → each scale resolves new detail; answerable-question space grows with resolution
