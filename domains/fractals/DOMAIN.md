## Domain filter
Only fractal concepts with direct structural isomorphisms to swarm operation qualify. Isomorphism requires: same recursive mechanism, same instability mode at scale boundaries, and an actionable swarm policy implication.

## Core isomorphisms

| Fractal concept | Swarm parallel | Isomorphism type | Status |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| Self-similarity | Similar lane-level patterns reappear at session/domain/multiswarm levels | Multi-scale invariance | OBSERVED |
| Fractal dimension | Boundary complexity of active work versus merged output | Complexity-density metric | THEORIZED |
| Bifurcation point | Small threshold changes (for example WIP caps/guards) flip stable operating regimes | Phase-transition control | OBSERVED |
| Iterated map | Expect -> act -> diff repetition generates emergent long-run structure | Recursive dynamics | OBSERVED |
| Attractor basin | Stable policy modes pull execution toward recurring lane-state patterns | Dynamic attractor model | THEORIZED |
