# Fractals Domain Index
Updated: 2026-02-27 | Sessions: 186

## What this domain knows
- **Seed evidence base**: swarm already shows recurring multi-scale structure (lane -> session -> domain bundles) and threshold-sensitive regime shifts.
- **Core structural pattern**: swarm scaling behavior looks like recursive geometry under policy iteration, where small local rules can produce large global structure changes.
- **Active frontiers**: 3 active domain frontiers in `domains/fractals/tasks/FRONTIER.md` (F-FRA1, F-FRA2, F-FRA3).
- **Cross-domain role**: fractals provides a scale-aware lens for control-theory, operations-research, and information-science policy transfer.

## Lesson themes

| Theme | Example lessons | Core insight |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| Recursive adaptation | L-223 | Repeated expect-act-diff loops can produce stable macro behavior from local updates |
| Scale and drift | L-242 | Growth and reset patterns are non-linear across scales, not simple homeostasis |
| Synchronization overhead | L-216, L-257 | Structure can improve coordination but may overfit to local scale if not revalidated globally |

## Structural isomorphisms with swarm design

| Fractal finding | Swarm implication | Status |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Self-similarity can be measured across levels | Evaluate policy transfer at lane/session/domain scales before promotion | THEORIZED |
| Regime shifts happen near threshold boundaries | Guard/WIP thresholds should be treated as bifurcation controls, not static constants | OBSERVED |
| Boundary complexity can grow faster than output | Track complexity-density to trigger pruning/compaction earlier | THEORIZED |
| Recursive local rules create global operating modes | Small contract changes need multi-scale replay before default adoption | OBSERVED |

## What's open
- **F-FRA1**: quantify self-similarity of swarm state across lane/session/domain scales and test when transfer breaks.
- **F-FRA2**: locate bifurcation thresholds where small policy changes flip dispatchability/conflict regimes.
- **F-FRA3**: define a fractal-complexity proxy that predicts when coordination overhead will dominate throughput.
