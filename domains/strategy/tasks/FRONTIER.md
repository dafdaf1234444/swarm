- **F-STR1**: Which priority policy and slot-allocation strategy maximizes net frontier advancement under current demand? Design: compare hybrid/value-density/risk-first under rolling windows and live lane outcomes. (S186)

- **F-STR2**: What plan-to-execution conversion contract prevents designed-but-unrun frontier debt? Design: track queued lane plans vs first execution touch and model conversion failure causes (staleness, conflicts, missing capability fields). (S186)

- **F-STR3**: How should swarm run multi-wave campaigns across domain bundles? Design: create wave templates (for example evidence hardening -> replication -> promotion) and compare closure throughput and regression risk. (S186)
