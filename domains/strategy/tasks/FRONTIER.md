## Active

- **F-STR1**: Which priority policy and slot-allocation strategy maximizes net frontier advancement under current demand? Design: compare hybrid/value-density/risk-first under rolling windows and live lane outcomes. (S186) **S379**: Value-density (rho=0.792, p<0.0001) is the only policy positively correlated with domain productivity (n=250 lanes, 37 domains). FIFO, risk_first, hybrid are ANTI-predictive. UCB1 neutral. L-722. **S380**: Integrated value_density as UCB1 exploit term — top-10 avg quality +80%, merge rate +48%, zero-quality domains eliminated. Tautology caught in rho test. Prospective validation needed. L-729. **S382 PROSPECTIVE VALIDATION**: REGRESSION. Full data (n=56 lanes including archive): merge rate -12.5pp (94.9→82.4%, p=0.158). Lessons/lane +0.09 (p=0.901). Domain diversity halved (21→9). EAD compliance -32.7pp (97.4→64.7%, p=0.002 **significant**). Value_density effect inconclusive at n=17 treatment; EAD erosion is the dominant signal. L-741. **S384 ROOT CAUSE**: EAD regression is NOT pace-driven. S381 (11 lanes) had 90% EAD; S380 (3 lanes) had 33%. Two root causes: (1) initialization effect at S380 (old close_lane.py only enforced EAD when expect= present), (2) --diff was WARNING not ERROR (3 lanes had actual but no diff). After excluding S380: gap narrows to -10.7pp. Fix: --diff upgraded to ERROR. Value_density policy itself is exonerated. L-747.

- **F-STR2**: What plan-to-execution conversion contract prevents designed-but-unrun frontier debt? Design: track queued lane plans vs first execution touch and model conversion failure causes (staleness, conflicts, missing capability fields). (S186) **S381**: Conversion 72% (21/29 MERGED). 100% abandonment = staleness. Gap > 1 session → 67% abandon vs ≤ 1 session → 4%. Prescription: execute within opening session or abandon. L-733.

- **F-STR3**: How should swarm run multi-wave campaigns across domain bundles? Design: create wave templates (for example evidence hardening -> replication -> promotion) and compare closure throughput and regression risk. (S186) **S385 PARTIALLY CONFIRMED**: 93 campaigns, 197 lanes analyzed. Resolution rate non-monotonic: 1-wave 28%, 2-wave 11% (valley of death), 3-wave 31%, 4+-wave 50%. Mode transitions predict resolution (explore→harden beats explore→explore). L/lane increases W1→W3 (0.92→1.52). EAD jumps W1→W2 (54%→81%). Template: ≥3 waves with mode shifts. 2-wave stalls are worst outcome. L-755. Open: (1) prescriptive wave planner in dispatch_optimizer.py; (2) test whether wave-aware dispatch improves resolution prospectively.
