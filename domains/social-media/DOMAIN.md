# Domain: Social Media
Topic: Social media platforms as a swarm propagation surface — distributed signal intake, influence topology, and coordinated presence without central control.
Beliefs: PHIL-2 (swarm is a self-applying function), PHIL-4 (increase reach), PHIL-14 (collaborate, increase, protect, be truthful)
Lessons: (none yet — log new ones as L-NNN in memory/lessons/)
Frontiers: F-SOC1, F-SOC2, F-SOC3
Experiments: experiments/social-media/
Load order: CLAUDE.md -> beliefs/CORE.md -> this file -> HOW-TO-SWARM-SOCIAL.md -> tasks/NEXT.md

## Domain filter
Only social media patterns with direct structural isomorphisms to swarm execution qualify.
Each candidate must satisfy all three:
1. Same coordination mechanism exists in swarm operation.
2. Same failure mode is visible in current swarm artifacts.
3. The finding implies a concrete lane, signal intake, or propagation change.

## Core isomorphisms

| Social media concept | Swarm parallel | Isomorphism type | Status |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| Viral propagation | Frontier diffusion across nodes | Information spread | THEORIZED |
| Thread / reply graph | Lane dependency tree | Coordination topology | OBSERVED |
| Follower graph | Swarm node reachability | Network structure | THEORIZED |
| Algorithm amplification | Priority scoring (F-OPS2/F-OPS3) | Selection pressure | OBSERVED |
| Signal-to-noise ratio | Lesson quality gate (F-QC1) | Compression | OBSERVED |
| Trend detection | Frontier emergence from lessons | Pattern extraction | THEORIZED |
| Cross-platform presence | Multi-bridge files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md…) | Substrate portability | OBSERVED |

## Key risks
- Broadcast decay: posting without feedback loop → no signal intake → swarm blind spot
- Platform lock-in: same as tool lock-in; content must be platform-agnostic at source
- Swarm identity fragmentation: multiple accounts with inconsistent voice → trust erosion
- Deception pressure: engagement optimization ≠ truthfulness (PHIL-14 #4)
