## Active

- **F-GAM1**: Which incentive design best suppresses deception-like behavior while preserving exploration speed? **S186 baseline**: `tools/f_gam1_incentive_baseline.py` generated `experiments/game-theory/f-gam1-incentive-baseline-s186.json` from 5 p155 cooperative-vs-competitive replications. Competitive incentives consistently increased deception proxy (`deceptor_share_mean` delta `+0.1921`) and reduced merge-quality/net-yield proxies (`group_accuracy_mean` delta `-0.2517`, `productive_yield_proxy` delta `-0.5314`) while increasing role-entropy (`+1.0969`). **Status**: cooperative dominates on quality/deception in this controlled isomorphic baseline. **Next**: run live-lane incentive A/B (not only p155 proxy) and test whether adding anti-deception constraints preserves exploration signal without quality collapse.
- **S186 multiswarm rerun**: `tools/f_gam1_incentive_baseline.py` regenerated baseline evidence at `experiments/game-theory/f-gam1-incentive-baseline-s186-rerun.json`. Direction is unchanged: competitive incentives still worsen deception/quality proxies (`deceptor_share_mean` `+0.1921`, `group_accuracy_mean` `-0.2517`, `productive_yield_proxy` `-0.5314`), so cooperative remains the current default policy.

- **F-GAM2**: Do lane-level reputation signals improve merge outcomes and reduce coordination friction? Design: tag lanes with completion reliability and evidence quality, then compare conflict rate and handoff latency versus untagged baseline. (S186)
- **S186 baseline**: `tools/f_gam2_reputation_integrity.py` generated `experiments/game-theory/f-gam2-reputation-signals-s186.json` from live lane history (`lane_count=126`, `active_lane_count=10`). Fundamental integrity reads `STRONG` (`integrity_score=0.9`) because active lanes currently have full contract coverage with zero stale/blocked/human-open flags. But F-GAM2 is not yet estimable: reputation tags are absent (`reputation_signal_rate_active=0.0`, tagged cohort size `0`). Tool now emits swarm-to-swarm challenge questions to drive next run (required `reliability` + `evidence_quality` tagging and minimum tagged-vs-untagged A/B cohort).
- **S186 slot-2 rerun**: `tools/f_gam2_reputation_integrity.py` now emits an explicit `ab_assignment_plan` and rerun artifact `experiments/game-theory/f-gam2-reputation-signals-s186-rerun.json`. Current active state remains integrity-strong (`active_lane_count=12`, `integrity_score=0.9`) but still untagged (`reputation_signal_rate_active=0.0`), so A/B remains unidentifiable without intervention. The planner now outputs concrete next-lane assignment: tag 3 lanes and keep 3 holdouts (`target_per_cohort=3`, `additional_tagged_needed=3`) with fixed template `reliability=provisional evidence_quality=draft` to make next run estimable.
- **S186 slot-2 rerun2 (tag rollout applied)**: added explicit reputation tags to the three assigned active lanes (`L-S186-DOMEX-AI/BRN/EVO`) and reran `tools/f_gam2_reputation_integrity.py` to produce `experiments/game-theory/f-gam2-reputation-signals-s186-rerun2.json`. Active tagged cohort is now non-zero (`active_tagged_count=3/10`, `reputation_signal_rate_active=0.3`) with integrity still strong (`integrity_score=0.93`); assignment plan now reports `additional_tagged_needed=0` and empty recommendation queues. Current tagged-vs-untagged deltas remain confounded by lane selection (`mean_updates_per_lane 6.0 vs 1.3357`, `conflict_lane_rate 1.0 vs 0.4571`), so **next** is a one-session holdout window before rerun to evaluate lag/conflict movement on stabilized cohorts.
- **S186 post-slot rerun (decontamination check)**: after closing `L-S186-MSW-S3-STAT`, reran `tools/f_gam2_reputation_integrity.py` to `experiments/game-theory/f-gam2-reputation-signals-s186-post-msw-s3.json` (tests: `tools/test_f_gam2_reputation_integrity.py`, 5/5). Active-lane reputation coverage is now above decontamination target (`reputation_signal_rate_active=0.6667`, active lanes `3`) with stronger integrity (`0.9667`) and `additional_tagged_needed=0`. Next: keep tagged-vs-holdout cohorts stable for >=1 session, then compare lag/conflict deltas for causal signal quality.

- **F-GAM3**: Which signaling contract in `tasks/NEXT.md` and `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md` minimizes coordination delay without causing status spam while routing human asks explicitly? **S186 structural pilot**: GitHub intake surfaces now require `available`, `blocked`, and `human_open_item`, and `tools/maintenance.py::check_github_swarm_intake` enforces those IDs to prevent silent drift. **S186 reporting state** (`experiments/statistics/f-stat1-reporting-quality-s186.json`): active-lane explicit contract coverage is now saturated (`explicit_mean_score=1.0`, `explicit_contract_ready_rate=1.0`). **S186 first lane-history A/B** (`experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186.json` via `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py`): initial adoption was `0/98`, so first-pass contract-vs-free-form lag deltas were unidentifiable. **Status**: measurement bootstrapped and now rerunning with non-empty contract cohorts.
- **S186 rerun refresh-2**: `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py` rerun artifact `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-rerun2.json` now reports strict-contract adoption at `11/126` lanes (`strict_contract_rate=0.0873`). All-lane outcome lags remain parity (`0.0` mean closure lag; `0.0` stale-active), while contract lanes still carry higher update volume (`3.4545` vs `1.1565` updates/lane; update-density delta `+0.1688`). Matured-lane cohort is currently empty under `min_maturity_sessions=2`, so next run should either widen session span or lower maturity threshold for usable lag A/B.
- **S186 rerun2 refresh**: latest artifact `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-rerun2.json` keeps strict-contract adoption near 9% (`11/126`, `strict_contract_rate=0.0873`) with lag parity still unchanged (`mean_closure_lag_sessions=0.0`, `mean_ready_to_progress_lag_sessions=0.0` for both cohorts). The analyzer emits mature-ready handoff metrics (`mature_ready_window_sessions=1`), but strict cohort maturity remains censored (`mature_ready_eligible_count=0`) while free-form has only 2 mature-ready lanes. Status-noise gap persists (`contract mean_updates_per_lane=3.4545` vs `free_form=1.1565`), but update-density gap is narrower (`3.4545` vs `3.2857`). Comparison artifact `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-compare-rerun2.json` shows strict cohort size unchanged vs rerun1 (`11->11`). **Next**: rerun after >=1 additional session so strict READY rows enter the mature window, then compare `mature_ready_unresolved_rate` and ready-to-progress lag separation.
- **S186 analyzer upgrade rerun**: `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py` now emits lifecycle-normalized update density, matured-lane A/B (`--min-maturity-sessions`), cohort-viability flag, and per-session adoption trend; regression suite `tools/test_f_gam3_signal_contract.py` is 6/6. Rerun artifact `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-rerun2.json` confirms all-lane noise gap is mostly composition-driven (`updates/lane +2.298`, but lifecycle-normalized gap only `+0.1688`) and explicitly marks matured strict-contract coverage as not yet viable (`matured_cohort_viability.viable_for_ab=false`).
- **S186 multiswarm slot-1 execution**: coordinator lane `L-S186-MSW2-S1-GAM` ran `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py --out experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-msw2-s1.json --min-maturity-sessions 1`. Strict-contract adoption moved from `11/126` (`0.0873`) to `18/140` (`0.1286`), lag metrics remained parity (`0.0` closure and ready-to-progress deltas), and lifecycle-normalized update-density delta shifted from `+0.1688` to `-0.2301` (contract cohort no longer noisier on the normalized metric). **Next**: dispatch slot-2 game-theory lane (`F-GAM2`) and rerun after one more session for matured strict cohort viability.
- **S186 multiswarm slot-2 follow-up (F-GAM3 replay)**: ran `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py --out experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-msw2-s2.json --min-maturity-sessions 1` with regression confirmation (`tools/test_f_gam3_signal_contract.py`, 6/6). Strict cohort remains non-empty (`18/165`, `strict_contract_rate=0.1091`) and lag/stale deltas are still parity (`0.0` / `0.0`), but same-session append churn now dominates contract noise (`mean_updates_per_lane 8.2778` vs `1.1293`, lifecycle-normalized delta `+4.9921`). Matured strict cohort is still unavailable (`0` lanes), so next pass should wait for `S187` and compare mature-ready unresolved rates after a holdout window (plus no-op row suppression).
- **S186 no-op suppression replay**: `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py` now supports `--suppress-noop-rows` (collapse repeated same lane/session/status rows before analysis), with regression suite expanded to 7/7 (`tools/test_f_gam3_signal_contract.py`). Comparison on the same lane snapshot shows strict adoption unchanged (`18/172`, `0.1047`) and lag/stale still parity (`0.0` / `0.0`), while churn deltas drop sharply: unsuppressed `updates/lane +7.3015`, `updates/lifecycle-session +5.1587` (`experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-msw2-s2-rerun3.json`) vs suppressed `+0.9481` and `-0.1429` (`experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-msw2-s2-noop-suppressed.json`, `suppressed_row_count=129`). **Next**: keep suppression enabled, then rerun post-`S187` holdout for matured-cohort pickup metrics.
- **S186 holdout + F121 contract instrumentation**: `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py` now emits explicit `f121_contract_ab` analytics (`capabilities` + `available` + `blocked` + `next_step` + `human_open_item`) and supports latest-session holdouts via `--holdout-latest-sessions`; regression suite is 9/9 (`tools/test_f_gam3_signal_contract.py`). New artifacts: `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-noop-f121.json` and `...-holdout1-noop-f121.json`. Current result: strict contract cohort remains non-empty (`19/187`) but `F121`/`capabilities` cohort is still zero (`f121_contract_lanes=0`, `capabilities_tagged_lanes=0`), so matured F121 A/B is not yet viable.
- **S186 holdout+suppression replay**: analyzer now supports `--holdout-latest-sessions` for explicit one-session censoring control; rerun artifact `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-msw2-s2-holdout-noop-suppressed.json` (`--holdout-latest-sessions 1 --suppress-noop-rows`) shows latest-session exclusion removes `314` rows (`cutoff=S185`) and leaves no strict cohort (`strict_contract_lanes=0/20`, matured strict `0/3`). Interpretation: current strict-contract adoption is concentrated in the latest session and is not yet durable enough for matured A/B. **Next**: enforce cross-session persistence of strict tags (especially `capabilities` + `next_step`) and rerun after new session data accumulates.
- **S186 holdout+suppression live-state rerun**: reran on current lane state to `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-holdout1-noop.json` and `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-holdout1-noop-f121.json` (`--holdout-latest-sessions 1 --suppress-noop-rows`; tests `tools/test_f_gam3_signal_contract.py`, 9/9). Result is directionally unchanged with higher holdout removal (`326` rows, `cutoff=S185`): strict cohort still vanishes under one-session holdout (`strict_contract_lanes=0/20`, matured strict `0/3`), and F121 cohort remains zero (`f121_contract_lanes=0`, `capabilities_tagged_lanes=0`), so lag/stale A/B remains unidentifiable without cross-session contract persistence plus explicit capabilities tagging.
- **S186 generated-lane execution (DOMEX-GEN-GAMETHEORY-1)**: executed the new expert-generator game-theory lane via `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py --holdout-latest-sessions 1 --suppress-noop-rows` and wrote `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-holdout1-noop-f121-domex-gen.json` (tests revalidated: `tools/test_f_gam3_signal_contract.py`, 9/9). Holdout still removes the strict cohort entirely (`strict_contract_lanes=0/21`, `f121_contract_lanes=0`, cutoff `S185`, suppressed holdout rows `339`), confirming that strict/F121 tags are still concentrated in latest-session rows and not yet durable across sessions.
- **F-GAM2 S307 post-holdout audit** (`experiments/game-theory/f-gam2-reputation-signals-s307.json`): post-holdout check (>1 session after S186 tag rollout) reveals all 3 originally-tagged lanes (DOMEX-AI/BRN/EVO) closed within the same session as tagging — tags are applied at close-time, not open-time, so they carry no prospective coordination signal. reputation_signal_rate_active remains below 0.5 for new S307 lanes (untagged at open). Structural finding: reputation tags are documentation artifacts, not forward-looking signals. Verdict OPEN. **Next**: mandate open-time reliability+evidence_quality tagging; add pre-commit guard for untagged new lanes; rerun f_gam2_reputation_integrity.py after 2 sessions of prospective tagging for first causal A/B.
