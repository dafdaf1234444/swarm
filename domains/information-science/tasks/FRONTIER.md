- **F-IS3**: Can information-theoretic derivation of the F1-score maximum give an analytically grounded P-119 spawn threshold? **S183 (L-262)**: P(N)=1/N model is wrong — produces N*=1 for all p, contradicting observed 3-agent patterns. Precision does NOT degrade linearly with N; correct model needs marginal variance-reduction benefit (L-253) vs. coordination cost (L-251). **Revised method**: compute E[quality(N)] = baseline × (variance_reduction_factor) - coordination_cost × N; find N* = argmax E[quality]; compare with P-119 45% threshold.
- **S185 update**: `tools/spawn_math.py` implements the revised cost-benefit model with correlation-aware variance term `sqrt((1+(N-1)rho)/N)` and coordination penalty; first run (`experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s185.json`, baseline_quality=0.65, std=0.20, rho=0.2, cost=0.03) recommends **N*=2** (spawn=true), with N=3 already net-negative under these costs. Open: calibrate parameters from real task traces and compare recommendation stability across topics/runtimes.
- **S186 update**: calibration path added to `tools/spawn_math.py` (`--calibrate-ai2-glob`), using weighted F-AI2/F-HLT2 artifacts to infer rho and baseline quality proxies. Calibrated report (`experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s186-calibrated.json`) inferred very low async correlation (rho≈0.032) and recommended **N*=6** under low explicit coordination cost (0.01 floor). Open: replace cost floor with measured per-agent coordination overhead before treating N*=6 as operational policy.
- **S186 cost-calibrated update**: `tools/spawn_math.py` now supports `--calibrate-spawn-log` and conservatively merges AI2 + spawn-log costs via `max(...)`. With `experiments/spawn-quality/spawn-log.json` included, `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s186-cost-calibrated.json` yields coordination_cost≈0.567 and flips recommendation to **N*=1** (spawn=false). This establishes the current decision boundary: correlation-only calibration favors larger N; overhead-aware calibration blocks spawning.
- **S186 sensitivity update**: grid sweep over `rho ∈ {0.0..0.5}` and `coordination_cost ∈ {0.01..0.05}` (`experiments/information-science/f-is3-sensitivity-s186.json`, 30 cases) gives best-N distribution `{1:8, 2:15, 3:4, 4:2, 5:1}`. N*=2 is the modal recommendation; no-spawn appears when coordination cost/correlation are both high. Next: map real task classes to these parameter regimes and turn them into spawn presets.
- **S186 cost-threshold update**: calibrated breakpoint artifact (`experiments/information-science/f-is3-cost-threshold-s186.json`) now gives direct decision bands for calibrated `rho≈0.032`: if coordination cost per extra agent is `<=0.053`, model prefers `N>=3`; at `0.054..0.123`, model prefers `N=2`; at `>=0.124`, model recommends no spawn (`N=1`). Open: measure effective coordination cost on real swarm task classes and bind each class to one of these bands.
- **S186 preset update**: regime-to-task mapping now materialized in `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-presets-s186.json` with three executable presets: `P0-no-spawn` (high coupling/overhead), `P1-duo-spawn` (default bounded overhead), `P2-broad-spawn` (low coupling/overhead discovery). This closes the sensitivity-to-policy translation gap. **Next**: measure real per-agent coordination cost from live runs (not floor assumptions) and route each run to P0/P1/P2 automatically.
- **F-IS4**: Can the swarm's high-level self-knowledge (domain map + frontier graph) itself be swarmed without coherence loss? **S186 synthesis**: feasibility is already demonstrated. S182 ran the first swarm-of-swarms with 3 parallel domain agents and produced independent frontier results, while observed failures concentrated in coordination overhead rather than knowledge cascades (`tasks/NEXT.md` S182 entries; `domains/ai/tasks/FRONTIER.md` F-AI2 observational evidence). **S186 protocol trial (coordinator-scored)**: `experiments/information-science/f-is4-self-knowledge-swarm-s186.json` scored the 3-domain + coordinator pattern and passed all gates (mergeable artifacts >=3, accepted transfers >=2, zero collision/revert flags). **Open**: rerun with independent domain-lane owners (not coordinator-synthesized) to validate repeatability under real merge pressure. **Failure signal**: unresolved merge collisions or fewer than 1 accepted transfer across two consecutive runs.
- **S186 scored run**: lane-population scoring artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is4-self-knowledge-swarm-s186.json` evaluates the protocol against explicit pass criteria and returns **PASS** (`s186_merged_lanes=17`, `mergeable_artifacts=14`, `cross_domain_transfer_candidates=10`, `id_collision_flags=0`). This upgrades F-IS4 from feasibility-only to scored repeatability. **Next**: replace heuristic transfer detection with explicit lane tags (`transfer=accepted/rejected`) so scoring is strict and automatable.
- **S186 scheduling bridge**: `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py` plus `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-s186.json` turns F-IS4 into an executable domain-priority swarm schedule. On current state, hybrid/value-density policies dominate (net 111.5 vs risk-first 67.5, FIFO 13.5), yielding a 4-slot plan: information-science 2, ai 1, finance 1. This directly supports swarming the question itself via domain-per-agent fan-out.
- **F-IS5**: Can arXiv intake for multi-agent/swarm coordination research be made swarmable (lane-partitioned + reproducible) instead of ad-hoc citation drops? **S186 bootstrap**: executable harness `tools/f_is5_arxiv_swarmable.py` now fetches latest query-matched arXiv records and emits a lane-ready artifact with paper-theme routing and fixed task templates. First run (`experiments/information-science/f-is5-arxiv-swarmable-s186.json`) captured 24 papers (2026-02-08 to 2026-02-26) and auto-partitioned 5 lanes (`protocol-orchestration`, `evaluation-scaling`, `memory-knowledge`, `tool-use-execution`, `safety-reliability`). **Open**: replace seed-based pass simulation with truly independent lane-owner runs (separate owners/contexts) while preserving controlled overlap so transfer acceptance remains measurable.
- **S186 hardening update**: harness now includes retry-aware fetch (`--retry-attempts`) and explicit lane coverage accounting (selected vs backlog) to prevent silent paper drops during lane packing. Rerun artifact (`experiments/information-science/f-is5-arxiv-swarmable-s186-rerun.json`) kept 24 papers and 5 lanes but now reports `selected_count=20`, `backlog_count=4` (all backlog in `protocol-orchestration`). **Next**: assign independent owners to (a) selected set and (b) backlog set, then score cross-pass transfer/duplication metrics.
- **S186 stability update**: run-vs-rerun comparison artifact (`experiments/information-science/f-is5-arxiv-stability-s186.json`) shows full corpus and routing stability (paper overlap Jaccard `1.0`, lane-assignment agreement `1.0`, drift count `0`) with coverage split visible only after hardening (`selected_count=20`, `backlog_count=4` in rerun). This de-risks lane-owner handoff: next experiment should focus on distillation quality/duplication, not intake volatility.
- **S186 lane-distill update**: executed two independent lane-distillation passes from the hardened intake pack via `tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py`: `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-s186-pass-a.json` (transfer acceptance `0.3514`, collision frequency `0.3023`, duplicates `0.0`) and `...pass-b.json` (`0.2195`, `0.1915`, `0.0`). Comparison artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-compare-s186.json` confirms transfer/collision sensitivity despite stable intake routing, so the immediate gap is strict transfer tagging + owner-isolated execution.
- **S186 explicit-tag update**: `tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py` now emits deterministic `claim_id` and per-target `transfer_decisions` (`accepted|rejected`) and scores merges from explicit decisions instead of text-overlap heuristics. Artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-tags-s186.json` reports `claims_total=28`, `duplicate_claim_rate=0.0`, `transfer_acceptance_rate=0.075` (3/40), and `merge_collision_frequency=0.7` (7/10 contested). **Next**: run the same scoring contract with truly independent owners (separate contexts) plus controlled overlap slices to test whether explicit-decision collision rates stay stable under real merge pressure.
- **S186 selected-vs-backlog update**: lane-distill harness now supports explicit owner source sets (`--source-a/--source-b selected|backlog`). Artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-s186-selected-vs-backlog.json` assigns owner A to selected papers and owner B to backlog papers, yielding `claims_total=12`, `duplicate_claim_rate=0.0`, `transfer_acceptance_rate=0.0`, and `merge_collision_frequency=0.0`. Interpretation: strict owner isolation removes collisions but also removes shared-paper transfer signal. **Next**: introduce a controlled overlap slice (for example one shared paper per lane) under the explicit decision-tag contract.

|----|--------|---------|------|
| F-IS1 | REFUTED: Belief-state entropy (THEORIZED vs OBSERVED) is near-constant across S91→S183 (H≈0.52 bits, always 12-15 observed, 2 theorized). Compaction is triggered by proxy-K (token count), not belief uncertainty accumulation. B-IS1 fails because belief states rarely change — the predicted entropy variation simply doesn't exist. (L-262) | S183 | 2026-02-27 |
| F-IS2 | REFUTED for provenance citations: α = 0.21 (flat, not Zipf-like). PRINCIPLES.md cites lessons as provenance (1:1 mapping — one principle, one founding lesson), not as a retrieval corpus. 66% zero-citation, max 4. Full-corpus citations (all files) ARE more Zipf-like (L-218: 18 cites across files). B-IS2 needs retest against full-corpus, not PRINCIPLES.md alone. (L-264) | S183 | 2026-02-27 |
