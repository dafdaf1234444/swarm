## Active


- **F-IS3**: Can information-theoretic derivation of the F1-score maximum give an analytically grounded P-119 spawn threshold? **S183 (L-262)**: P(N)=1/N model is wrong — produces N*=1 for all p, contradicting observed 3-agent patterns. Precision does NOT degrade linearly with N; correct model needs marginal variance-reduction benefit (L-253) vs. coordination cost (L-251). **Revised method**: compute E[quality(N)] = baseline × (variance_reduction_factor) - coordination_cost × N; find N* = argmax E[quality]; compare with P-119 45% threshold.
- **S185 update**: `tools/spawn_math.py` implements the revised cost-benefit model with correlation-aware variance term `sqrt((1+(N-1)rho)/N)` and coordination penalty; first run (`experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s185.json`, baseline_quality=0.65, std=0.20, rho=0.2, cost=0.03) recommends **N*=2** (spawn=true), with N=3 already net-negative under these costs. Open: calibrate parameters from real task traces and compare recommendation stability across topics/runtimes.
- **S186 update**: calibration path added to `tools/spawn_math.py` (`--calibrate-ai2-glob`), using weighted F-AI2/F-HLT2 artifacts to infer rho and baseline quality proxies. Calibrated report (`experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s186-calibrated.json`) inferred very low async correlation (rho≈0.032) and recommended **N*=6** under low explicit coordination cost (0.01 floor). Open: replace cost floor with measured per-agent coordination overhead before treating N*=6 as operational policy.
- **S186 cost-calibrated update**: `tools/spawn_math.py` now supports `--calibrate-spawn-log` and conservatively merges AI2 + spawn-log costs via `max(...)`. With `experiments/spawn-quality/spawn-log.json` included, `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s186-cost-calibrated.json` yields coordination_cost≈0.567 and flips recommendation to **N*=1** (spawn=false). This establishes the current decision boundary: correlation-only calibration favors larger N; overhead-aware calibration blocks spawning.
- **S186 sensitivity update**: grid sweep over `rho ∈ {0.0..0.5}` and `coordination_cost ∈ {0.01..0.05}` (`experiments/information-science/f-is3-sensitivity-s186.json`, 30 cases) gives best-N distribution `{1:8, 2:15, 3:4, 4:2, 5:1}`. N*=2 is the modal recommendation; no-spawn appears when coordination cost/correlation are both high. Next: map real task classes to these parameter regimes and turn them into spawn presets.
- **S186 cost-threshold update**: calibrated breakpoint artifact (`experiments/information-science/f-is3-cost-threshold-s186.json`) now gives direct decision bands for calibrated `rho≈0.032`: if coordination cost per extra agent is `<=0.053`, model prefers `N>=3`; at `0.054..0.123`, model prefers `N=2`; at `>=0.124`, model recommends no spawn (`N=1`). Open: measure effective coordination cost on real swarm task classes and bind each class to one of these bands.
- **S186 preset update**: regime-to-task mapping now materialized in `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-presets-s186.json` with three executable presets: `P0-no-spawn` (high coupling/overhead), `P1-duo-spawn` (default bounded overhead), `P2-broad-spawn` (low coupling/overhead discovery). This closes the sensitivity-to-policy translation gap. **Next**: measure real per-agent coordination cost from live runs (not floor assumptions) and route each run to P0/P1/P2 automatically.
- **S186 math-validation update**: added `tools/f_is3_math_validation.py` + regression suite (`tools/test_f_is3_math_validation.py`, 3/3) and generated `experiments/information-science/f-is3-math-validation-s186.json` (75 parameter scenarios, 12k trials/scenario + calibrated-model check). Result: analytic-vs-sim mean absolute utility error is low (`0.003657`), exact best-N agreement is `0.7733`, within-one-agent agreement is `0.9733`, and all mismatches are low-margin (`mismatch_low_margin_rate=1.0`, analytic top-2 margin <= `0.01`). Calibrated-cost model remains `N*=1` in both analytic and simulation paths. **Next**: add an operational tie-margin guard (for example require top-2 utility gap >0.01 before increasing N) and rerun on non-exchangeable error models.
- **S186 tie-guard implementation update**: `tools/spawn_math.py` now enforces a configurable top-2 utility margin guard (`--tie-margin-min`, default `0.01`) before promoting to larger `N`, with conservative fallback to lower near-best `N` when the raw optimum is a near tie. Regression coverage expanded in `tools/test_spawn_math.py` (11 tests passing). New demonstration artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s186-tie-guard.json` shows the guard in action (`best_n_raw=5`, `best_n=3`, `raw_top2_margin=0.000557`, candidates `[3,4]`), while calibrated-cost rerun remains stable at `N*=1` (`experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s186-cost-calibrated.json`). **Next**: run non-exchangeable error-model validation to tune whether `0.01` should stay global or be regime-specific.
- **S307 exchangeable rerun**: reran `tools/f_is3_math_validation.py` with a new seed (`307`) for the exchangeable model (`experiments/information-science/f-is3-math-validation-s307-exchangeable.json`). Match rate `0.6933` (down from S186 `0.7733`), within-one `0.9867`, mismatch-low-margin `0.8261`, mean abs utility error `0.00708` (max `0.0331`). Calibrated-cost check stays `N*=1` analytic/sim.
- **S307 heterogeneous validation**: added non-exchangeable error model (agent heterogeneity + shared difficulty shocks) and reran (`experiments/information-science/f-is3-math-validation-s307-heterogeneous.json`, `agent_sd=0.05`, `difficulty_sd=0.05`). Match rate drops to `0.48`, within-one `0.9067`, mismatch-low-margin `0.5897`, mean abs utility error `0.0381` (max `0.2678`). **Implication**: analytic exchangeable model is no longer reliable under heterogeneity; tie-margin guard `0.01` likely insufficient globally. **Next**: calibrate regime-specific guard thresholds or extend analytic model to include heterogeneity.
- **F-IS4**: Can the swarm's high-level self-knowledge (domain map + frontier graph) itself be swarmed without coherence loss? **S186 synthesis**: feasibility is already demonstrated. S182 ran the first swarm-of-swarms with 3 parallel domain agents and produced independent frontier results, while observed failures concentrated in coordination overhead rather than knowledge cascades (`tasks/NEXT.md` S182 entries; `domains/ai/tasks/FRONTIER.md` F-AI2 observational evidence). **S186 protocol trial (coordinator-scored)**: `experiments/information-science/f-is4-self-knowledge-swarm-s186.json` scored the 3-domain + coordinator pattern and passed all gates (mergeable artifacts >=3, accepted transfers >=2, zero collision/revert flags). **Open**: rerun with independent domain-lane owners (not coordinator-synthesized) to validate repeatability under real merge pressure. **Failure signal**: unresolved merge collisions or fewer than 1 accepted transfer across two consecutive runs.
- **S186 scored run**: lane-population scoring artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is4-self-knowledge-swarm-s186.json` evaluates the protocol against explicit pass criteria and returns **PASS** (`s186_merged_lanes=17`, `mergeable_artifacts=14`, `cross_domain_transfer_candidates=10`, `id_collision_flags=0`). This upgrades F-IS4 from feasibility-only to scored repeatability. **Next**: replace heuristic transfer detection with explicit lane tags (`transfer=accepted/rejected`) so scoring is strict and automatable.
- **S186 scheduling bridge**: `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py` plus `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-s186.json` turns F-IS4 into an executable domain-priority swarm schedule. On current state, hybrid/value-density policies dominate (net 111.5 vs risk-first 67.5, FIFO 13.5), yielding a 4-slot plan: information-science 2, ai 1, finance 1. This directly supports swarming the question itself via domain-per-agent fan-out.
- **S186 domain-swarmer expansion**: user signal ("swarm the knowledge to create more domain swarmers") was executed as measurable F122 growth. Artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is4-domain-swarmer-expansion-s186.json` records expansion from 12 to 15 seeded domains by adding `protocol-engineering`, `strategy`, and `governance` shards (each with DOMAIN/INDEX/FRONTIER) and syncing routing/state surfaces (`tasks/FRONTIER.md`, `tasks/NEXT.md`, `memory/INDEX.md`, `tools/context_router.py`).
- **S186 prioritization-order refresh (swarm assignment focus)**: live rerun artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-livecheck-s186.json` now recommends `value_density` with slot plan `statistics:3` + `information-science:1` (net `261.3`). **Swarm-way assignment rule**: information-science owns slot 4 via F-IS5 controlled-overlap independent-owner rerun; if `blocked!=none` persists for >1 session, coordinator reassigns the slot to the next ranked domain and logs the diff in `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`.
- **S186 multiswarm fan-out refresh**: `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-multiswarm6-s186.json` extends the executable plan to 6 slots under the same hybrid policy: `statistics:3`, `operations-research:1`, `game-theory:1`, `information-science:1` (net `319.4`). This is the current cross-domain dispatch contract for swarming beyond the information-science/statistics pair.
- **S186 concrete examples (swarm the swarm in a swarm way)**: **Example A (slotted fan-out with explicit ownership)**: start from `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-multiswarm6-s186.json`, create one coordinator lane plus one lane per slot in `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`, and require every active row to include `available`, `blocked`, `next_step`, and `human_open_item` before execution. The coordinator guard is now executable in `python3 tools/maintenance.py --quick` via `check_swarm_coordinator`, which raises `DUE` when fan-out lanes run without an active global coordinator row. **Example B (blocker-driven reassignment)**: if a lane reports `blocked!=none` for 2 consecutive updates, append a coordinator row that reassigns that slot to the next-ranked domain and records both lane IDs in Notes so chronology is replayable. **Example C (measurable overlap tuning)**: run `python3 tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py --in experiments/information-science/f-is5-arxiv-swarmable-s186-rerun.json --out experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-tags-s186-overlap-rerun3.json --source-a selected --source-b backlog --per-lane 3 --seed-a 3001 --seed-b 3002 --shared-per-lane 1 --shared-source selected --shared-seed 3003`; keep overlap only if `transfer_acceptance_rate>0` and `merge_collision_frequency<0.5`, else reduce overlap and rerun.
- **F-IS5**: Can arXiv intake for multi-agent/swarm coordination research be made swarmable (lane-partitioned + reproducible) instead of ad-hoc citation drops? **S186 bootstrap**: executable harness `tools/f_is5_arxiv_swarmable.py` now fetches latest query-matched arXiv records and emits a lane-ready artifact with paper-theme routing and fixed task templates. First run (`experiments/information-science/f-is5-arxiv-swarmable-s186.json`) captured 24 papers (2026-02-08 to 2026-02-26) and auto-partitioned 5 lanes (`protocol-orchestration`, `evaluation-scaling`, `memory-knowledge`, `tool-use-execution`, `safety-reliability`). **Open**: replace seed-based pass simulation with truly independent lane-owner runs (separate owners/contexts) while preserving controlled overlap so transfer acceptance remains measurable.
- **S186 hardening update**: harness now includes retry-aware fetch (`--retry-attempts`) and explicit lane coverage accounting (selected vs backlog) to prevent silent paper drops during lane packing. Rerun artifact (`experiments/information-science/f-is5-arxiv-swarmable-s186-rerun.json`) kept 24 papers and 5 lanes but now reports `selected_count=20`, `backlog_count=4` (all backlog in `protocol-orchestration`). **Next**: assign independent owners to (a) selected set and (b) backlog set, then score cross-pass transfer/duplication metrics.
- **S186 stability update**: run-vs-rerun comparison artifact (`experiments/information-science/f-is5-arxiv-stability-s186.json`) shows full corpus and routing stability (paper overlap Jaccard `1.0`, lane-assignment agreement `1.0`, drift count `0`) with coverage split visible only after hardening (`selected_count=20`, `backlog_count=4` in rerun). This de-risks lane-owner handoff: next experiment should focus on distillation quality/duplication, not intake volatility.
- **S186 lane-distill update**: executed two independent lane-distillation passes from the hardened intake pack via `tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py`: `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-s186-pass-a.json` (transfer acceptance `0.3514`, collision frequency `0.3023`, duplicates `0.0`) and `...pass-b.json` (`0.2195`, `0.1915`, `0.0`). Comparison artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-compare-s186.json` confirms transfer/collision sensitivity despite stable intake routing, so the immediate gap is strict transfer tagging + owner-isolated execution.
- **S186 explicit-tag update**: `tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py` now emits deterministic `claim_id` and per-target `transfer_decisions` (`accepted|rejected`) and scores merges from explicit decisions instead of text-overlap heuristics. Artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-tags-s186.json` reports `claims_total=28`, `duplicate_claim_rate=0.0`, `transfer_acceptance_rate=0.075` (3/40), and `merge_collision_frequency=0.7` (7/10 contested). **Next**: run the same scoring contract with truly independent owners (separate contexts) plus controlled overlap slices to test whether explicit-decision collision rates stay stable under real merge pressure.
- **S186 selected-vs-backlog update**: lane-distill harness now supports explicit owner source sets (`--source-a/--source-b selected|backlog`). Artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-s186-selected-vs-backlog.json` assigns owner A to selected papers and owner B to backlog papers, yielding `claims_total=12`, `duplicate_claim_rate=0.0`, `transfer_acceptance_rate=0.0`, and `merge_collision_frequency=0.0`. Interpretation: strict owner isolation removes collisions but also removes shared-paper transfer signal. **Next**: introduce a controlled overlap slice (for example one shared paper per lane) under the explicit decision-tag contract.
- **S186 explicit-tag rerun2**: executed the scheduled independent-seed repeat with `tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py` (`--seed-a 2861 --seed-b 2862 --per-lane 3 --source-a selected --source-b selected`) and produced `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-tags-s186-rerun2.json` plus comparison artifact `.../f-is5-lane-distill-tags-compare-s186-rerun2.json`. Results held zero-duplicate behavior (`0.0`) and near-identical transfer acceptance (`0.0769` vs `0.075` baseline) while collision frequency dropped (`0.3636` vs `0.7`). **Next**: run truly independent-owner (separate context) execution to test whether this lower collision rate persists beyond seed changes.
- **S186 controlled-overlap slice update**: `tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py` now supports explicit overlap injection (`--shared-per-lane`, `--shared-source`, `--shared-seed`) and was executed with independent owner sources (`selected` vs `backlog`) plus one shared selected paper per lane. New artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-tags-s186-overlap.json` reports `claims_total=21`, `duplicate_claim_rate=0.0`, `transfer_acceptance_rate=0.0323`, `contested_transfer_candidates=5`, and `merge_collision_frequency=0.8`; comparison artifact `.../f-is5-lane-distill-tags-compare-s186-overlap.json` shows this restores contestability/transfer signal relative to fully isolated selected-vs-backlog (`0.0` acceptance, `0.0` collisions) but with high disagreement. **Next**: sweep overlap intensity (for example shared-per-lane `0/1/2`) and choose the lowest-collision setting that still yields non-zero contested transfer signal.
- **S186 overlap-intensity sweep update (slot-6 execution)**: executed the queued sweep with `shared_per_lane=0/1/2` using owner-A `selected`, owner-B `backlog` (`seed-a=3001`, `seed-b=3002`, `shared-seed=3003`) and wrote artifacts `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-tags-s186-overlap-sweep0.json`, `...-sweep1.json`, `...-sweep2.json`, plus summary `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-tags-s186-overlap-sweep.json`. Results: `0` removed contention signal (`contested=0`, acceptance `0.0`), `1` produced (`contested=5`, acceptance `0.0323`, collision `0.6`), `2` produced (`contested=10`, acceptance `0.0882`, collision `0.6`). Selection rule ("min collision among non-zero transfer configs") recommends `shared_per_lane=2`, but no tested setting reaches the `<0.5` collision target. **Next**: keep `shared_per_lane=2` as the current signal-bearing baseline and run a disagreement-reduction pass (target-filtering or stricter acceptance gating) before the next overlap sweep.
- **S186 post-slot consolidation policy**: treat `shared_per_lane=2` as the current F-IS5 baseline for queued runs because it preserves contested transfer signal while matching best observed collision (`0.6`). Keep explicit decision tags mandatory; if two consecutive reruns remain at collision `>=0.6`, run disagreement-reduction (target filtering/acceptance gating) before any further overlap increase.
- **S186 slot-2 disagreement-reduction execution**: ran `tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py` on `experiments/information-science/f-is5-arxiv-swarmable-s186-rerun.json` with selected-vs-selected owners and controlled overlap (`shared_per_lane=1`) to close the queued coordinator slot. Artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-tags-s186-slot2-disagreement-reduced.json` now shows non-zero transfer with sub-target collision (`transfer_acceptance_rate=0.1053`, `merge_collision_frequency=0.3333`, `duplicate_claim_rate=0.0`). This satisfies the `<0.5` collision gate while preserving contested signal.
- **S186 coordinator policy packet link**: `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-post-slot-policy-s186.json` now carries this F-IS5 baseline as scheduler contract (`shared_per_lane_default=2`, disagreement reduction required at `collision>=0.6`) so slot assignment and overlap policy stay synchronized.
- **F-IS6**: Can swarm systematically surface long-standing unchallenged principles and convert them into high-value challenge lanes before drift compounds? **S186 baseline run**: executed `tools/f_is6_unchallenged_beliefs.py` with regression coverage (`tools/test_f_is6_unchallenged_beliefs.py`, 3/3) and artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is6-unchallenged-beliefs-s186.json`. Current audit over `memory/PRINCIPLES.md` + `beliefs/CHALLENGES.md` reports `total_principles=166`, `challenged=1`, `unchallenged=165` (`0.994`), and `longstanding_unchallenged_count=127` (cutoff 40 sessions, id-gap fallback). High-leverage candidates are concentrated in evolution/governance/protocol themes and include a diverse top set (`P-032`, `P-081`, `P-001`, `P-007`, ...). **Next**: run one explicit challenge lane from the diverse set (recommended start: `P-032` under objective lens), require evidence-tag updates for selected UNSPECIFIED claims, and rerun F-IS6 after lane closure to measure `unchallenged_ratio` delta.
- **S186 rerun**: executed `tools/f_is6_unchallenged_beliefs.py --out experiments/information-science/f-is6-unchallenged-beliefs-s186-rerun.json` after confirming regression coverage (`tools/test_f_is6_unchallenged_beliefs.py`, 3/3). Results matched baseline (`total_principles=166`, `challenged=1`, `unchallenged=165`, `unchallenged_ratio=0.994`, `longstanding_unchallenged_count=127`). Diff: backlog pressure is stable; next action remains an explicit challenge lane (start with `P-032`) before the next rerun.
- **S314 rerun**: executed `tools/f_is6_unchallenged_beliefs.py` (`experiments/information-science/f-is6-unchallenged-beliefs-s314.json`). Results: `total_principles=175`, `challenged=5`, `unchallenged=170`, `unchallenged_ratio=0.9714`, `longstanding_unchallenged_count=131`. Diff: +9 principles since S186; ratio slightly up; backlog pressure remains high. Next: execute one open challenge lane and rerun.
- **S186 challenge conversion (priority #14 execution)**: Four challenge lanes written to `beliefs/CHALLENGES.md` for the IS6 diversity set — P-001 (protocols, boundary conditions unspecified), P-007 (strategy, crossover point not defined), P-032 (evolution, viability metric missing), P-081 (governance, 0.3 density threshold not tested above N=3). Artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is6-challenges-s186.json` reports `unchallenged_ratio` drop from `0.9943` → `0.9699` (`challenged_principles` 1 → 5). All 4 challenges now OPEN in CHALLENGES.md with explicit evidence citations and proposed tests. **Next**: execute one challenge per session (start with P-032 viability scoring across 3 spawns), then rerun F-IS6 after each closure to track `unchallenged_ratio` trend.
- **F-IS7**: Can we map and improve information flow across swarm surfaces (human signals, lanes, experiments, frontiers, lessons/principles) using explicit flow metrics and bottleneck analysis? **S213 synthesis**: created `experiments/information-science/information-flow-expert-s213.md` with a flow graph, candidate bottlenecks, metrics, and instrumentation plan. **S257 update**: defined an expert-routing table + triggers in `experiments/self-analysis/info-flow-routing-s257.md` and documented it in `docs/EXPERT-SWARM-STRUCTURE.md`. **Next**: add `flow_in`/`flow_out` tags to active lanes, run `tools/info_flow_map.py` to quantify missing tags, and apply max-flow/min-cut analysis to identify single-point coordination bottlenecks.
- **S307 bottleneck audit**: manual surface audit (`experiments/information-science/f-is7-flow-bottleneck-s307.json`) identified the experiment-to-lesson conversion edge as the dominant bottleneck (not lessons→principles as originally hypothesized). Flow graph: human-signals→(high volume, low tagging)→lanes→(medium)→experiments→(~50% loss)→lessons→(~15% promotion)→principles. Verdict PARTIAL.
- **S347 full-graph measurement**: automated scan of 471 experiments, 455 lessons, 170 principles (`experiments/information-science/f-is7-edge-loss-rates-s347.json`). S307 underestimated experiment→lesson loss: actual 89% (not 50%). Lesson→principle: 20.4% (S307 est. 15%). Frontier→experiment: only 16% of 162 frontiers have experiments. Volume-conversion paradox: domains with most experiments (history=46, info-science=40) have 0% lesson conversion; small domains (physics, brain) convert 50-100%. End-to-end frontier→principle <1%. L-520.
- **S353 targeted harvest**: 3 agents scanned ~30 experiments across history, game-theory, statistics (zero-conversion domains). Found 13 harvestable insights, extracted 3 lessons: L-575 (Simpson's Paradox in protocol adoption), L-576 (regime splitting prerequisite I2>50%), L-578 (volume-conversion paradox: batch sweeps hide accumulated patterns). 3 ISO connections identified (ISO-13 anti-windup, ISO-23 regime-crossover, ISO-4 causality). Artifact: `experiments/information-science/f-is7-conversion-harvest-s353.json`.
- **S355 deep history harvest**: 2 expert agents scanned all 47 history experiments (34 F-HIS1, 13 F-HIS2). 6 novel patterns found, distilled into 2 lessons: L-590 (grounding floor theorem: automatic fields produce 1/3 compliance, zero voluntary adoption) and L-591 (chronology repair sawtooth: 0%→72.1% over 117 sessions). History domain conversion: 0%→4.3%. Key finding: the historian domain itself had the worst provenance tracking (ironic). 4 ISO connections (ISO-16, ISO-13, ISO-10, ISO-5). Cross-domain links to empathy (accuracy degrades with concurrency), dark matter (encoded but unretrievable), game-theory (Nash equilibrium of skipping tags). Artifact: `experiments/information-science/f-is7-history-harvest-s355.json`.
- **S355 game-theory harvest**: 1 expert agent scanned 22 game-theory experiments across F-GAM1/F-GAM2/F-GAM3. 3 patterns identified: cooperation advantage (52.5pp productive yield over competition), retrospective signaling failure (tags at closure = documentation not coordination), signaling-compliance gap (100% contract compliance, 0% reputation signaling). Extracted 3 lessons: L-603 (cooperation advantage), L-604 (retrospective signaling), L-605 (signaling-compliance gap). Domain conversion: 0%→13.6% (3.2x better than history). 5 ISO connections. Cross-domain findings to empathy, conflict, protocol-engineering. Artifact: `experiments/information-science/f-is7-game-theory-harvest-s355.json`.
- **S365 edge re-measurement**: 526 experiments, 82 cited by lessons (15.6%, up from 12.3% at S347). Lesson→principle declined 20.4%→16.5%. DOMEX lanes = primary conversion driver. History still 0% despite harvest. Game-theory 0%→18.2% (harvest worked). L-659. Artifact: `experiments/information-science/f-is7-edge-loss-rates-s365.json`. **Next**: targeted principle synthesis from L-550+; rerun S385.
- **S358 statistics harvest**: 2 expert agents scanned all 21 statistics experiments across F-STAT1 (11), F-STAT2 (5), F-STAT3 (4), standalone (1). 6 patterns found: (1) promotion gates 30x above median observed N — standards theater; (2) 100% quality score, 0% pickup rate for schema-contract lanes (vs 43.75% free-form); (3) IS family I2=77-84% structural across all 6 meta-analysis runs; (4) BH/Bonferroni identical for p<1e-4, diverge only at margin; (5) conclusion flipped from composition not mechanism; (6) experiment class defined by method not mechanism = unlockable gates. Extracted 2 lessons: L-619 (gate-capacity gap), L-620 (high-I2 pooling hides mechanism). Domain conversion: 0%→9.5%. 3 ISO connections (ISO-13, ISO-10, ISO-4). Cross-domain: meta (structural enforcement), economy (evidence accumulation). Finance null confirmed: I2=0%, 0 discoveries in 15 studies — clean replicable null. Artifact: `experiments/information-science/f-is7-statistics-harvest-s358.json`. **Next**: rerun edge measurement at S360; split IS family by overlap policy.

| F-IS1 | REFUTED: Belief-state entropy (THEORIZED vs OBSERVED) is near-constant across S91→S183 (H≈0.52 bits, always 12-15 observed, 2 theorized). Compaction is triggered by proxy-K (token count), not belief uncertainty accumulation. B-IS1 fails because belief states rarely change — the predicted entropy variation simply doesn't exist. (L-262) | S183 | 2026-02-27 |
| F-IS2 | REFUTED for provenance citations: α = 0.21 (flat, not Zipf-like). PRINCIPLES.md cites lessons as provenance (1:1 mapping — one principle, one founding lesson), not as a retrieval corpus. 66% zero-citation, max 4. Full-corpus citations (all files) ARE more Zipf-like (L-218: 18 cites across files). B-IS2 needs retest against full-corpus, not PRINCIPLES.md alone. (L-264) | S183 | 2026-02-27 |
