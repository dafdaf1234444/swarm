- **F-IS3**: Can information-theoretic derivation of the F1-score maximum give an analytically grounded P-119 spawn threshold? **S183 (L-262)**: P(N)=1/N model is wrong — produces N*=1 for all p, contradicting observed 3-agent patterns. Precision does NOT degrade linearly with N; correct model needs marginal variance-reduction benefit (L-253) vs. coordination cost (L-251). **Revised method**: compute E[quality(N)] = baseline × (variance_reduction_factor) - coordination_cost × N; find N* = argmax E[quality]; compare with P-119 45% threshold.
- **S185 update**: `tools/spawn_math.py` implements the revised cost-benefit model with correlation-aware variance term `sqrt((1+(N-1)rho)/N)` and coordination penalty; first run (`experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s185.json`, baseline_quality=0.65, std=0.20, rho=0.2, cost=0.03) recommends **N*=2** (spawn=true), with N=3 already net-negative under these costs. Open: calibrate parameters from real task traces and compare recommendation stability across topics/runtimes.
- **S186 update**: calibration path added to `tools/spawn_math.py` (`--calibrate-ai2-glob`), using weighted F-AI2/F-HLT2 artifacts to infer rho and baseline quality proxies. Calibrated report (`experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s186-calibrated.json`) inferred very low async correlation (rho≈0.032) and recommended **N*=6** under low explicit coordination cost (0.01 floor). Open: replace cost floor with measured per-agent coordination overhead before treating N*=6 as operational policy.
- **S186 cost-calibrated update**: `tools/spawn_math.py` now supports `--calibrate-spawn-log` and conservatively merges AI2 + spawn-log costs via `max(...)`. With `experiments/spawn-quality/spawn-log.json` included, `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s186-cost-calibrated.json` yields coordination_cost≈0.567 and flips recommendation to **N*=1** (spawn=false). This establishes the current decision boundary: correlation-only calibration favors larger N; overhead-aware calibration blocks spawning.
- **S186 sensitivity update**: grid sweep over `rho ∈ {0.0..0.5}` and `coordination_cost ∈ {0.01..0.05}` (`experiments/information-science/f-is3-sensitivity-s186.json`, 30 cases) gives best-N distribution `{1:8, 2:15, 3:4, 4:2, 5:1}`. N*=2 is the modal recommendation; no-spawn appears when coordination cost/correlation are both high. Next: map real task classes to these parameter regimes and turn them into spawn presets.
- **S186 cost-threshold update**: calibrated breakpoint artifact (`experiments/information-science/f-is3-cost-threshold-s186.json`) now gives direct decision bands for calibrated `rho≈0.032`: if coordination cost per extra agent is `<=0.053`, model prefers `N>=3`; at `0.054..0.123`, model prefers `N=2`; at `>=0.124`, model recommends no spawn (`N=1`). Open: measure effective coordination cost on real swarm task classes and bind each class to one of these bands.
- **S186 preset update**: regime-to-task mapping now materialized in `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-presets-s186.json` with three executable presets: `P0-no-spawn` (high coupling/overhead), `P1-duo-spawn` (default bounded overhead), `P2-broad-spawn` (low coupling/overhead discovery). This closes the sensitivity-to-policy translation gap. **Next**: measure real per-agent coordination cost from live runs (not floor assumptions) and route each run to P0/P1/P2 automatically.
- **F-IS4**: Can the swarm's high-level self-knowledge (domain map + frontier graph) itself be swarmed without coherence loss? **S186 synthesis**: feasibility is already demonstrated. S182 ran the first swarm-of-swarms with 3 parallel domain agents and produced independent frontier results, while observed failures concentrated in coordination overhead rather than knowledge cascades (`tasks/NEXT.md` S182 entries; `domains/ai/tasks/FRONTIER.md` F-AI2 observational evidence). **Open**: turn this from ad-hoc success into a repeatable protocol. **Run design**: claim 3 domain lanes + 1 coordinator lane; each domain lane must ship (a) one domain self-model delta and (b) one cross-domain transfer candidate; coordinator lane merges accepted transfers into global FRONTIER/NEXT. **Pass criteria**: at least 3 mergeable artifacts, at least 2 accepted cross-domain transfers, 0 unresolved ID collisions, and no contradiction requiring revert. **Failure signal**: unresolved merge collisions or fewer than 1 accepted transfer across two consecutive runs.

| ID | Answer | Session | Date |
|----|--------|---------|------|
| F-IS1 | REFUTED: Belief-state entropy (THEORIZED vs OBSERVED) is near-constant across S91→S183 (H≈0.52 bits, always 12-15 observed, 2 theorized). Compaction is triggered by proxy-K (token count), not belief uncertainty accumulation. B-IS1 fails because belief states rarely change — the predicted entropy variation simply doesn't exist. (L-262) | S183 | 2026-02-27 |
| F-IS2 | REFUTED for provenance citations: α = 0.21 (flat, not Zipf-like). PRINCIPLES.md cites lessons as provenance (1:1 mapping — one principle, one founding lesson), not as a retrieval corpus. 66% zero-citation, max 4. Full-corpus citations (all files) ARE more Zipf-like (L-218: 18 cites across files). B-IS2 needs retest against full-corpus, not PRINCIPLES.md alone. (L-264) | S183 | 2026-02-27 |
