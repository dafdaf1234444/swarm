## Domain filter
Only governance concepts with direct structural isomorphisms to swarm operation qualify. Isomorphism requires: same authority/enforcement mechanism, same coordination failure mode, and an actionable governance implication.

## Core isomorphisms

| Governance concept | Swarm parallel | Isomorphism type | Status |
|--------------------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| Constitutional hierarchy | SWARM.md > CORE > frontier/task/lesson authority chain | Rule precedence | OBSERVED |
| Enforcement tiers | Structural vs behavioral controls in maintenance/hooks | Compliance architecture | OBSERVED |
| Claim protocol | Append-only claims and resolution locks | Coordination safety | OBSERVED |
| Challenge process | Belief dispute and revision loop | Epistemic governance | OBSERVED |
| Legitimacy drift | Rules without evidence/use lose force over time | Governance decay | THEORIZED |
