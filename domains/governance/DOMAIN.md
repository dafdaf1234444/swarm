## Domain filter
Only governance concepts with direct structural isomorphisms to swarm operation qualify. Isomorphism requires: same authority/enforcement mechanism, same coordination failure mode, and an actionable governance implication.

## Core isomorphisms

| Governance concept | Swarm parallel | Isomorphism type | Status |
|--------------------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| Constitutional hierarchy | SWARM.md > CORE > frontier/task/lesson authority chain | Rule precedence | OBSERVED |
| Enforcement tiers | Structural vs behavioral controls in maintenance/hooks | Compliance architecture | OBSERVED |
| Claim protocol | Append-only claims and resolution locks | Coordination safety | OBSERVED |
| Challenge process | Belief dispute and revision loop | Epistemic governance | OBSERVED |
| Legitimacy drift | Rules without evidence/use lose force over time | Governance decay | THEORIZED |

## Isomorphism vocabulary
ISO-5 (feedback — stabilizing): policy feedback → negative feedback loop; regulation restores equilibrium; checks and balances = stabilizing feedback
ISO-13 (integral windup): rule accumulation → integral windup; regulations accumulate without sunset clause; bureaucracy = unreleased windup
ISO-15 (specialization-generalization): committee structure → specialist subcommittee + generalist council; separation of expertise from coordination
ISO-7 (emergence): democratic process → emergent collective decision; macro-policy irreducible to individual vote; Condorcet paradox as emergence failure
ISO-4 (phase transition): constitutional crisis → phase transition; institutional legitimacy crosses threshold → discontinuous regime change
ISO-2 (selection → attractor): political competition → selection pressure; policy convergence = attractor; median voter theorem
## Isomorphism vocabulary (S337 resonance expansion)
ISO-7: emergent coordination pattern → knowledge stigmergy via structural handoffs; session cycles maintain evidence quality; challenge signal determines stable regime
