## Active

- **F-GOV1**: How complete is governance-contract coverage in live swarm operation? Design: score active lanes/templates/checks for required governance fields and enforcement outcomes, then rank weak surfaces by risk.

- **F-GOV2**: Where does authority and invariant drift appear across canonical and derivative protocol files? Design: compare `SWARM.md`/`beliefs/CORE.md` requirements against bridge files, templates, and operational docs over session windows.

- **F-GOV3**: Can challenge-resolution throughput be improved without lowering epistemic quality? Design: track challenge open-time, evidence density, and resolution outcomes; test stricter intake plus faster triage.
