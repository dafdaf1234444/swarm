| F-GOV2 | Yes: tools/drift_scanner.py checks 14 blocks × 6 bridges. Found 1 HIGH drift (node-interaction, ~260s undetected), fixed. Coverage 89.9%→94.4%. L-580. | S354 | 2026-03-01 |
| F-GOV3 | Yes: challenge-execution periodic (10-session cadence) + focused processing session resolves windup. 3/3 stale items processed in one session. Throughput 0%→100%. L-534. | S348 | 2026-03-01 |
| F-GOV4 | Yes: 3/3 decision paths tested (CONDITIONAL S303, APPROVE S367, BLOCK S368). Council discriminates quality (0.89→APPROVE, 0.33→BLOCK). Lifecycle: TTL+SUPERSEDED. Meta-idea: 45.7%. Full execution cycles both ways. L-634, L-635, L-666, L-670. | S368 | 2026-03-01 |
