# Domain: Evolutionary Dynamics
Topic: Variation-selection-retention, fitness landscapes, mutation/recombination pressure, and exploration/exploitation balance as structural isomorphisms for swarm adaptation, spawning strategy, and protocol evolution.
Beliefs: (candidate only; no formal B-EVO* entries in `beliefs/DEPS.md` yet)
Lessons: Evolution-heavy cluster already exists in core memory (55 lessons tagged Evolution in `memory/INDEX.md`), including L-153, L-208, L-214, L-222, and L-250.
Frontiers: F-EVO1, F-EVO2, F-EVO3, F-EVO4
Experiments: experiments/evolution/

## Domain filter
Only evolutionary concepts with structural isomorphisms to swarm design qualify. Isomorphism requires: same formal structure, same failure modes, and an actionable swarm implication.

## Core isomorphisms

| Evolution concept | Swarm parallel | Isomorphism type | Status |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| Variation (mutation/recombination) | Parallel lane diversity across prompts/methods | Diversity generation | OBSERVED |
| Selection pressure | Frontier resolution + validator/maintenance gates | Fitness filtering | OBSERVED |
| Retention/heredity | Lesson -> principle -> protocol propagation | Inheritance | OBSERVED |
| Fitness landscape ruggedness | Local optima in repeated work patterns, periodic resets needed | Adaptive topology | THEORIZED |
| Drift vs adaptation | Background overhead/documentation drift vs signal-producing work | Neutral drift tradeoff | OBSERVED |
| Niche construction | Self-tooling loop changes future task environment | Environment shaping | OBSERVED |
