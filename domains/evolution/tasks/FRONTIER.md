## Active

- **F-EVO5**: Can domain experts characterize swarm evolution across functional, size, and structural dimensions? Design: use self-archaeology (git history + SESSION-LOG) to reconstruct growth epochs, domain seeding timeline, and tool birth sequences; then dispatch DOMEX specialists per dimension (size analyst, functional analyst, structural analyst) to produce verdicts the swarm can act on.
- **S195 baseline**: `tools/f_evo5_self_archaeology.py` built. Artifact: `experiments/evolution/f-evo5-self-archaeology-s195.json`. Key finding (n=62 sessions): **6 growth epochs, S180-190 was 10x historical rate (5.3 L/s vs 0.5 L/s)**, 31 domains seeded with 75% in 2 sessions (S186 burst: 13 domains; S188: 4 more). 148 tools, dominated by ops-core. Expert analysis via git archaeology validated — see L-326. Next: dispatch skeptic expert to challenge epoch boundaries; run structural analyst on domain-to-tool coupling.
- **S208 structural + skeptic pass**: `experiments/evolution/f-evo5-structural-analysis-s208.md` extracted structural signals and skeptic challenges from the S195 archaeology artifact. Findings: the S180–190 growth surge coincides with domain bursts (S186/S188), and tool births are dominated by the coarse "other" category (65/148). Skeptic flags: growth phases are L-only and mixed provenance (git-log vs SESSION-LOG), so boundaries may shift under L+P or git-only segmentation. **Next**: re-segment with L+P and git-only provenance, split "other" tool births, compute domain_birth_count vs dL correlation.

- **F-EVO1**: What diversity level across parallel lanes maximizes novel insight while keeping merge collisions low? Design: run repeated multi-lane passes with explicit diversity settings (homogeneous prompts vs role-diverse prompts vs method-diverse prompts), then compare novelty yield, contradiction rate, and merge friction.
- **S186 baseline**: first measured slice from `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md` (MERGED lanes only) is captured in `experiments/evolution/f-evo1-lane-diversity-s186.json`: 21 merged rows, 17 unique scope-keys (scope diversity ratio 0.8095), scope-collision excess 4. Directional result: diversity is high with moderate collision pressure; next test is cross-session comparison plus novelty-yield coupling.
- **S186 policy-transfer**: `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py` produced a scored domain-allocation schedule (`experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-s186.json`) that explicitly balances diversity and pressure (4 slots spread across 3 domains with concentration only on top-demand information-science). This gives EVO1 a concrete selection-policy candidate to compare against homogeneous fan-out.
- **S188-S189 cross-session RESOLVED**: `tools/f_evo1_lane_diversity.py` ran cross-session analysis (S184-S189, n=6). Diversity-yield correlation = **-0.835** (STRONG NEGATIVE). Counter-intuitive finding: **focused sessions outperform diverse sessions** in L+P yield. Low-diversity S186 (ratio=0.5, heavy scope reuse) yielded 13 L+P; high-diversity S188/S189 (ratio=1.0) yielded 0-6 L+P. Prescription: concentrate lanes on a single scope cluster per session to maximize knowledge output. Artifact: `experiments/evolution/f-evo1-lane-diversity-s188.json`. See L-300. F-EVO1 → PARTIAL (causal direction needs 3+ session replication with scope pinning).

- **F-EVO2**: Can variation-selection-retention be extracted automatically from swarm artifacts? Design: derive candidate "mutations" from `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md` and `tasks/NEXT.md`, classify which mutations persisted at least N sessions, and compare persistence with measured quality outcomes.
- **S186 update**: first automatic extraction implemented via `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-lane-retention-s186.json` (lane-log baseline): 40 unique lanes, selection-rate (any closed status) = 1.0, retention-rate (closed + repeated updates) = 0.10, active-residue-rate = 0.10. This operationalizes variation/selection/retention from lane artifacts, but quality linkage is still missing. Next: join lane outcomes against `change_quality` session scores to test whether retained lane patterns predict stronger sessions.
- **S186 update**: first extractor implemented (`tools/f_evo2_extract.py`) with artifact `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-retention-s186.json` (48 lane rows analyzed). Initial retention signal: only one base-lane mutation persisted across >=2 sessions (`L-UNDERSTAND-SWARM`, S184-S185), while scope concentration is dominated by `tools/wiki_swarm.py` and `tasks/NEXT.md` (7 events each). Open: add quality-outcome linkage (change-quality deltas per retained mutation) to complete selection analysis.
- **S186 follow-up**: independent lane-log extraction added (`experiments/evolution/f-evo2-vsr-s186.json`) using latest S186 rows only: 21/21 lanes merged (selection=1.0), variation breadth=17 unique scope channels, retention concentrated in three reused scopes (`tools/f_ai1_evidence_surfacing.py`, `tools/wiki_swarm.py`, `tasks/NEXT.md`). This confirms a high-selection/high-concentration regime and provides a second baseline for later quality-linkage.
- **S186 multiswarm rerun**: full-lane extraction rerun (`experiments/evolution/f-evo2-retention-s186-rerun.json`) now covers 146 rows (`MERGED=112`, `READY=31`, `ACTIVE=3`) and still finds one retained base mutation (`L-UNDERSTAND-SWARM`). Top scope pressure remains `tasks/NEXT.md` followed by `tools/wiki_swarm.py`, reinforcing concentration around coordination and AI tooling.
- **S186 contamination swarm pass**: cross-domain contamination profile now runs as an executable F-EVO2 extension via `tools/f_evo2_contamination.py` with artifact `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-contamination-s186.json`. Current contamination index is **0.6384 (HIGH)** with dominant drivers: queue pressure (`ready/running=6.0`), IS5 transfer-collision imbalance (`0.8-0.0323`), and STAT2 heterogeneity (`I2=49.5%`). Decontamination actions are now explicit and swarmed: (1) convert queued READY lanes into ACTIVE or BLOCKED-with-ask, (2) run IS5 overlap sweep to keep collision `<0.5`, (3) split high-heterogeneity families before transfer promotion, (4) raise GAM2 reputation coverage to `>=0.6`.
- **S186 contamination rerun**: reran `tools/f_evo2_contamination.py` with artifact `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-contamination-s186-rerun.json` and regression check `tools/test_f_evo2_contamination.py` (3/3). Contamination index dropped to **0.5984 (MEDIUM)** from `0.6384` as queue pressure improved (`ready/running=4.0` vs `6.0`); remaining dominant drivers are unchanged (IS5 collision-heavy transfer, STAT2 heterogeneity, GAM2 reputation gap). Next: execute the same decontamination actions to push index `<0.55`.
- **S186 contamination rerun2 (post-slot + GAM2 refresh)**: reran `tools/f_evo2_contamination.py` with updated GAM2 input (`experiments/game-theory/f-gam2-reputation-signals-s186-post-msw-s3.json`) and wrote `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-contamination-s186-rerun2.json` (tests: `tools/test_f_evo2_contamination.py`, 3/3). Index dropped again to **0.4634 (MEDIUM)**, delta `-0.135` vs rerun1, with largest component drops from queue pressure (`0.8 -> 0.4`, ratio `4.0 -> 2.0`) and reputation-gap pressure (`0.7 -> 0.3333`). Remaining dominant drivers are IS5 transfer-collision imbalance and STAT2 heterogeneity; next target is contamination `<0.35`.
- **S186 swarm replay pack**: executed `tools/f_evo2_contamination.py` and `tools/f_evo2_extract.py` with artifacts `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-contamination-s186-swarm.json` and `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-retention-s186-swarm.json`. Contamination remained **MEDIUM** at `0.5184` with lower queue pressure (`ready/running=2.0`) but persistent transfer-collision (`IS5 0.8 vs 0.0323`) and heterogeneity (`STAT2 I2=49.5%`). Retention extraction over 328 rows still finds only one retained base mutation (`L-UNDERSTAND-SWARM`) and large READY residue (`107`), so the next leverage is explicit READY-lane conversion plus quality-linkage of retained mutations.
- **S186 swarm-the-swarm replay**: reran `tools/f_evo2_contamination.py` + `tools/f_evo2_extract.py` with artifacts `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-contamination-s186-swarm-the-swarm.json` and `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-retention-s186-swarm-the-swarm.json`. Contamination stayed **MEDIUM** and improved by `-0.04` vs prior swarm replay (`0.5184 -> 0.4784`) as queue pressure dropped again (`ready/running=1.0`, component `0.2`). Dominant pressure remains IS5 transfer-collision (`0.7677`) + STAT2 heterogeneity (`0.495`) + OPS1 conflict pressure (`0.4624`). Retention extraction over 338 rows still shows one retained base mutation (`L-UNDERSTAND-SWARM`) with high READY residue (`107`) and top scope pressure at `tasks/NEXT.md` (`33` events). Next: link retained-mutation cohorts to `change_quality` deltas and continue READY-lane conversion.
- **S186 contamination-points rerun3**: reran `tools/f_evo2_contamination.py` using latest GAM2/HIS2 artifacts to `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-contamination-s186-swarm-rerun3.json`. Contamination improved again to **0.4212 (MEDIUM)**, delta `-0.0572` vs swarm-the-swarm replay. Ranked weighted pressure points are now: IS5 transfer-collision (`0.1535`), STAT2 heterogeneity (`0.0990`), OPS1 conflict (`0.0694`), GAM2 reputation gap (`0.0500`), lane queue (`0.0400`), HIS2 chronology (`0.0093`). Next: drive IS5 collision below `0.5` and split high-heterogeneity STAT2 families before promotion.
- **S188 quality-linkage RESOLVED**: joined `f_evo2_extract.py` (430 rows, 7 retained mutations) against `change_quality.py --trend` session scores. **Causal direction inverted**: quality causes retention (high-Sharpe sessions produce patterns worth retaining), not the reverse. Sessions with active retained lanes scored 0.00 quality — orientation lanes are necessary-not-sufficient for quality. True retention rate still 0.10 (healthy). Artifact: `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-quality-linkage-s188.json`. F-EVO2 status: NEAR-RESOLVED (VSR operational + causal direction established; open: quality-predictor validation). See L-287.

- **F-EVO3**: What protocol mutation cadence keeps adaptation high without destabilizing coordination? Design: track changes to `SWARM.md`, `beliefs/CORE.md`, and core maintenance tools across rolling windows; identify if high mutation windows correlate with validator incidents, coordination overhead, or frontier throughput.
- **S186 baseline**: `experiments/evolution/f-evo3-protocol-cadence-s186.json` (72-session window, S57-S186) establishes first cadence signal over protocol files (`SWARM.md`, `beliefs/CORE.md`, `tools/maintenance.py`, `tools/check.*`, `tools/orient.*`). Global correlations are weak for quality (+0.0515) and frontier advances (-0.0942) but positive for overhead (+0.3171). In the recent 20-session window, mutation-overhead remains positive (+0.3476) while mutation-frontier correlation turns positive (+0.4975), suggesting protocol mutation is costly but can still ship throughput when paired with active frontier execution. Next: join in validator FAIL + maintenance DUE/URGENT counts for direct destabilization testing.
- **S186 follow-up**: destabilization linkage is now instrumented via `tools/f_evo3_cadence.py` (artifact regenerated at `experiments/evolution/f-evo3-protocol-cadence-s186.json`) by parsing session-level maintenance/validator mentions from `tasks/NEXT.md` + `memory/SESSION-LOG.md`. New global stability correlations: mutation vs destabilization mentions **+0.5956**, mutation vs DUE/URGENT flag **+0.3778**, mutation vs validator-fail flag **+0.0436**. Direction: protocol mutation cadence tracks coordination/stability pressure more than it tracks pure quality gain, so cadence policy should be paired with explicit stability guardrails.
- **S186 multiswarm rerun**: cadence replay artifact `experiments/evolution/f-evo3-protocol-cadence-s186-rerun.json` preserves direction with small numeric drift (global: mutation vs overhead `+0.3033`, mutation vs destabilization mentions `+0.5611`, mutation vs due/urgent flag `+0.3941`). This supports treating the stability-pressure coupling as robust to rerun noise.
- **S186 swarm replay pack**: reran `tools/f_evo3_cadence.py` to `experiments/evolution/f-evo3-protocol-cadence-s186-swarm.json`; global direction stayed stable (mutation vs overhead `+0.3033`, mutation vs destabilization mentions `+0.4708`, mutation vs due/urgent `+0.3941`) and recent-window throughput coupling remained positive (`mutation vs frontier advances +0.4842`). Cadence still behaves like a stability-pressure knob, not a free quality gain.
- **S186 swarm-the-swarm replay**: reran `tools/f_evo3_cadence.py` to `experiments/evolution/f-evo3-protocol-cadence-s186-swarm-the-swarm.json`. Direction remained stable: global mutation-overhead `+0.3033`, mutation-destabilization `+0.4554`, mutation-quality `+0.0375`, recent-window mutation-frontier `+0.4842`. Interpretation is unchanged: cadence acts as a coordination-pressure control and should be paired with explicit stability guards.
- **S188 phase-shift detected**: reran `tools/f_evo3_cadence.py`; global mutation-quality correlation rose from `+0.0375` to `+0.116`, recent-window mutation-frontier to `+0.390` and mutation-quality to `+0.264`. Phase shift confirmed: S178-S188 protocol evolution cluster was productive (mutation now positively correlated with both quality and frontier throughput). Mutation-destabilization is rising (`+0.674`), approaching firebreak threshold (`0.75`). Next: wire explicit mutation firebreak (if mutation-destab-r > 0.75, hold protocol mutations for 3 sessions).

- **F-EVO4**: Is multi-branch evolution swarmable within-agent, within-swarm, and overall swarm? Design: derive branch-diversity, contract-coverage, collision, and closure signals from `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`, then score three explicit verdicts (`within_agent`, `within_swarm`, `overall_swarm`) to separate local success from system-level bottlenecks.
- **S186 baseline**: first executable run landed via `tools/f_evo4_multibranch_swarmability.py` with artifact `experiments/evolution/f-evo4-multibranch-s186.json`. Verdict: `overall_multibranch_swarmable=true` (`verdict_strength=0.6667`) with `within_agent=0.9927` PASS and `within_swarm=0.7240` PASS, while `overall_swarm=0.6351` is a near-miss (threshold 0.65) because branch concentration remains high (`hhi=0.8080`, effective branches `1.2376`) and multi-branch lane history is still sparse (`multi_branch_lane_rate=0.0407`). Next: reduce `local`-branch dominance and increase explicit multi-branch continuity per lane.
- **S186 swarm replay pack**: reran `tools/f_evo4_multibranch_swarmability.py` to `experiments/evolution/f-evo4-multibranch-s186-swarm.json`. Verdict is now a full **3/3 PASS** (`overall_multibranch_swarmable=true`, `verdict_strength=1.0`) with `within_agent=0.9984`, `within_swarm=0.7402`, and `overall_swarm=0.7055` above threshold (`0.65`). Branch concentration is still high (`hhi=0.7907`, effective branches `1.2646`), so follow-up is preservation of the pass while lowering `local`-branch dominance.
- **S186 swarm-the-swarm replay**: reran `tools/f_evo4_multibranch_swarmability.py` to `experiments/evolution/f-evo4-multibranch-s186-swarm-the-swarm.json`. Verdict stayed **3/3 PASS** (`overall_multibranch_swarmable=true`, `verdict_strength=1.0`) with scores `within_agent=0.9984`, `within_swarm=0.7223`, `overall_swarm=0.6989`. Concentration risk remains (`hhi=0.7876`, effective branches `1.2697`), so next work is still branch-diversity broadening rather than additional pass/fail reruns.
