## Active

- **F-EVO1**: What diversity level across parallel lanes maximizes novel insight while keeping merge collisions low? Design: run repeated multi-lane passes with explicit diversity settings (homogeneous prompts vs role-diverse prompts vs method-diverse prompts), then compare novelty yield, contradiction rate, and merge friction.
- **S186 baseline**: first measured slice from `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md` (MERGED lanes only) is captured in `experiments/evolution/f-evo1-lane-diversity-s186.json`: 21 merged rows, 17 unique scope-keys (scope diversity ratio 0.8095), scope-collision excess 4. Directional result: diversity is high with moderate collision pressure; next test is cross-session comparison plus novelty-yield coupling.
- **S186 policy-transfer**: `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py` produced a scored domain-allocation schedule (`experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-s186.json`) that explicitly balances diversity and pressure (4 slots spread across 3 domains with concentration only on top-demand information-science). This gives EVO1 a concrete selection-policy candidate to compare against homogeneous fan-out.

- **F-EVO2**: Can variation-selection-retention be extracted automatically from swarm artifacts? Design: derive candidate "mutations" from `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md` and `tasks/NEXT.md`, classify which mutations persisted at least N sessions, and compare persistence with measured quality outcomes.
- **S186 update**: first automatic extraction implemented via `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-lane-retention-s186.json` (lane-log baseline): 40 unique lanes, selection-rate (any closed status) = 1.0, retention-rate (closed + repeated updates) = 0.10, active-residue-rate = 0.10. This operationalizes variation/selection/retention from lane artifacts, but quality linkage is still missing. Next: join lane outcomes against `change_quality` session scores to test whether retained lane patterns predict stronger sessions.
- **S186 update**: first extractor implemented (`tools/f_evo2_extract.py`) with artifact `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-retention-s186.json` (48 lane rows analyzed). Initial retention signal: only one base-lane mutation persisted across >=2 sessions (`L-UNDERSTAND-SWARM`, S184-S185), while scope concentration is dominated by `tools/wiki_swarm.py` and `tasks/NEXT.md` (7 events each). Open: add quality-outcome linkage (change-quality deltas per retained mutation) to complete selection analysis.
- **S186 follow-up**: independent lane-log extraction added (`experiments/evolution/f-evo2-vsr-s186.json`) using latest S186 rows only: 21/21 lanes merged (selection=1.0), variation breadth=17 unique scope channels, retention concentrated in three reused scopes (`tools/f_ai1_evidence_surfacing.py`, `tools/wiki_swarm.py`, `tasks/NEXT.md`). This confirms a high-selection/high-concentration regime and provides a second baseline for later quality-linkage.

- **F-EVO3**: What protocol mutation cadence keeps adaptation high without destabilizing coordination? Design: track changes to `SWARM.md`, `beliefs/CORE.md`, and core maintenance tools across rolling windows; identify if high mutation windows correlate with validator incidents, coordination overhead, or frontier throughput.
- **S186 baseline**: `experiments/evolution/f-evo3-protocol-cadence-s186.json` (72-session window, S57-S186) establishes first cadence signal over protocol files (`SWARM.md`, `beliefs/CORE.md`, `tools/maintenance.py`, `tools/check.*`, `tools/orient.*`). Global correlations are weak for quality (+0.0515) and frontier advances (-0.0942) but positive for overhead (+0.3171). In the recent 20-session window, mutation-overhead remains positive (+0.3476) while mutation-frontier correlation turns positive (+0.4975), suggesting protocol mutation is costly but can still ship throughput when paired with active frontier execution. Next: join in validator FAIL + maintenance DUE/URGENT counts for direct destabilization testing.
- **S186 follow-up**: destabilization linkage is now instrumented via `tools/f_evo3_cadence.py` (artifact regenerated at `experiments/evolution/f-evo3-protocol-cadence-s186.json`) by parsing session-level maintenance/validator mentions from `tasks/NEXT.md` + `memory/SESSION-LOG.md`. New global stability correlations: mutation vs destabilization mentions **+0.5956**, mutation vs DUE/URGENT flag **+0.3778**, mutation vs validator-fail flag **+0.0436**. Direction: protocol mutation cadence tracks coordination/stability pressure more than it tracks pure quality gain, so cadence policy should be paired with explicit stability guardrails.
