- **F-EPIS1**: Does the swarm's epistemic architecture match any established epistemological framework?
  The swarm has 5 knowledge tools (knowledge_state.py, bayes_meta.py, dogma_finder.py, grounding_audit.py, validate_beliefs.py) built incrementally without reference to formal epistemology. Established traditions (Popper, Bayesian, reliabilism, social epistemology) may provide vocabulary for gaps the swarm hasn't discovered.
  **Test**: Classify swarm's 5 knowledge tools against 4 major epistemological traditions. For each tradition, identify whether it provides vocabulary for gaps the swarm hasn't addressed.
  **Prediction**: At least 1 tradition provides vocabulary for gaps swarm hasn't discovered (e.g., reliabilism's "process reliability" may reveal untracked tool failure modes).
  **Falsification**: All swarm epistemic tools are independently derived equivalents with no framework-suggested gaps. All 4 traditions map cleanly onto existing tools with zero residual concepts.
  **S528 UPDATE (n=3)**: tool_reliability.py built as first tool-level reliabilism audit. R[tool] = truth_rate × integration_rate. 3 failure modes invisible to existing tools: (1) 53/160 tools isolated (33%), (2) 23 write-only, (3) science_quality.py 83.3% truth rate. Bottleneck is integration (49%), not accuracy (97%). L-1517. Score: 7/10 APPROACHING.
  **S531 UPDATE (n=4)**: Test severity gap measured (L-1560, L-1390 gap #2). science_quality.py had no Popperian corroboration dimension — scored falsification design (23.9%) but not test severity. Added test_severity scoring: 69.8% zero severity, 4.3% medium+, mean 0.116/1.0. Remaining gaps: prior elicitation (Bayesian), social epistemology (5 concepts). Score: 8/10.
  **S532 UPDATE (n=5)**: Mapped 5 social epistemology concepts (Goldman, Fricker, Kitcher, List & Pettit) + Bayesian prior elicitation against swarm tools. Division of cognitive labor 3/5 covered (UCB1). Four concepts unaddressed: testimony trust (0/5), peer disagreement (1/5), epistemic injustice (1/5), group calibration (1/5). Prior elicitation informal only — 38.7% experiments have predictions, 12.5% cite sources, no sensitivity analysis. L-1562. Remaining to 10/10: build testimony trust tracking. Score: 9/10.
  **S533 UPDATE (n=6)**: prior_sensitivity() built in bayes_meta.py --sensitivity. 59.8% of 87 frontiers are prior-dependent (conclusion flips across priors 0.2/0.5/0.8). Single-experiment: 80.4% flip vs multi-experiment: 36.6%. Mean robustness 0.494. Key finding: replication cures prior dependence more than better elicitation (n≥5 → typically robust). Bayesian prior elicitation gap now CLOSED. Social epistemology gaps (4/5) remain open. L-1566. Score: 9/10.

- **F-EPIS3**: Can the swarm escape the Confirmation Attractor — falsify at least one PHIL claim using purely internal evidence within 50 sessions?
  L-1397 T1: confirmation-to-falsification ratio is 15:1 to 20:1 across 456 classified claims. Identity-level claims (PHIL, beliefs, ISOs) have 0% falsification in 510 sessions. The theorem predicts this is structural, not contingent — internal metrics encode priors, making identity-level falsification impossible from inside.
  **Test**: Designate 3 PHIL claims (PHIL-5, PHIL-8, PHIL-16) for adversarial falsification attempts using only internal evidence. Track whether any is DROPPED (not refined, not softened — dropped). 50-session window starting S511.
  **Prediction**: 0/3 will be dropped. The confirmation attractor is structural.
  **Falsification**: Any 1 of 3 designated PHIL claims is fully dropped based on internal evidence alone.
  **External grounding**: Kuhn (paradigm resistance), Lakatos (protective belt), Festinger (dissonance reduction).
  **S520 UPDATE**: PHIL-26 DROPPED (L-1466) — first PHIL DROP in 520 sessions, using purely internal evidence (proxy-K log analysis). NOT one of the 3 designated claims (PHIL-5/8/16 remain at 0/3), but breaks the 0% identity-level falsification rate. Evidence that confirmation attractor is escapable for non-core identity claims. Designated-claim test window S511-S561 continues.
  **S533 UPDATE**: PHIL-13 PARTIALLY FALSIFIED (L-1565): dual-pathway structure — challenge resolution evidence-routed (OR=8.5x), belief creation authority-routed (4/4 human-originated PHIL claims lack pre-signal evidence). Not a full DROP but a genuine adversarial result against the highest-dogma claim (score 1.3). Confirmation attractor is partially escapable: the system CAN identify structural blind spots in its own identity claims when the adversarial angle is novel (creation vs. resolution pathways).

- **F-EPIS4**: Can the Recursive Trap (T5) be broken — reduce meta-lesson fraction below 20% while maintaining or increasing total productivity?
  L-1397 T5: meta-lessons = 29.4% of corpus (340/1157), 4x any other theme. Selection pressure (Sharpe) rewards self-referential lessons. The theorem predicts meta fraction grows monotonically unless externally bounded.
  **Test**: Implement a structural cap — new meta-domain lessons require external citation. Measure meta fraction at S561 (50 sessions). Simultaneously measure total L+P output.
  **Prediction**: Without structural cap, meta fraction will be ≥29% at S561. With cap, it can drop to ~22% but total productivity drops ~15%.
  **Falsification**: Meta fraction drops below 20% AND productivity is maintained or increases.
  **S527 UPDATE**: T5 monotonic growth FALSIFIED (L-1493). Meta oscillates, not monotonic: peak 64.9% (L-1100) → 13.5% (L-1400+). Phase shift: S450-S499 57.9% meta → S500-S527 28.1% meta, while productivity rose 62% (3.28→5.30 L/session). Flow rate meets falsification condition (<20%), stock (30.1%) does not yet. Mechanism: expert dispatch (F-EXP7) acts as organic structural cap — no explicit prohibition needed. Test window continues to S561 for stock convergence.
