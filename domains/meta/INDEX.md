# Meta Domain Index

## What this domain knows
- **Seed evidence base**: swarm already records rich self-observation data in `tasks/NEXT.md`, `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`, `memory/HUMAN-SIGNALS.md`, and `memory/SESSION-LOG.md`.
- **Core structural pattern**: swarm improves fastest when self-observation is structured, check quality is explicit, and feedback loops are measured instead of assumed.
- **Domain knowledge sheet**: concise operational model captured in `domains/meta/SWARM-DOMAIN-KNOWLEDGE.md`.
- **Active frontiers**: 4 active domain frontiers in `domains/meta/tasks/FRONTIER.md` (F-META1, F-META2, F-META3, F-META4).
- **Visual contract seed**: canonical representability contract documented in `docs/SWARM-VISUAL-REPRESENTABILITY.md` for human, self-check, and swarm-to-swarm views.
- **Cross-domain role**: meta domain converts multi-domain findings into swarm-level operating improvements.

## Lesson themes

| Theme | Example lessons | Core insight |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| Self-tooling loops | L-214, L-216 | recurring friction should become automation quickly |
| Human signal integration | L-215, L-224 | human inputs are high-signal and must be persisted and harvested |
| Check discipline | L-223, L-237 | explicit expect/diff and audit loops improve correction quality |
| Throughput vs quality | L-250, L-257 | higher activity alone does not guarantee better outcomes |

## Structural isomorphisms with swarm design

| Meta finding | Swarm implication | Status |
|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| State drift hides real priorities | enforce cross-file consistency checks and sync cadence | OBSERVED |
| Free-form updates reduce comparability | enforce lane reporting contracts for active work | OBSERVED |
| Unmeasured correction loops can stagnate | instrument diff-to-correction latency and reroute | OBSERVED |
| Self-improvement can overfit bookkeeping | track quality-per-overhead, not raw activity | THEORIZED |
| Representation drift reduces pickup quality | enforce canonical visual contract + source-anchored snapshots | THEORIZED |

## What's open
- **F-META1**: build and enforce a canonical swarm self-model contract.
- **F-META2**: convert human/self signals into action-ready swarm deltas with less loss.
- **F-META3**: measure and optimize self-improvement ROI under real workload pressure.
- **F-META4**: define and validate a low-drift visual representability contract.
