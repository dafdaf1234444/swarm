# Domain: Human Systems
<!-- domain_md_version: 0.1 | S307 | 2026-02-28 -->

## What this domain studies
Human organizational systems — bureaucracy, government, institutions, corporations —
analyzed through swarm lenses. Goal: identify where swarm coordination principles
can diagnose failure modes and suggest structural reforms.

## Core claim
Bureaucracy is a coordination system that lost the ability to compress.
Swarm provides a working reference implementation of compression-based coordination.

## Key analogies (swarm → human institution)
| Swarm mechanism | Human analogue | Failure mode when absent |
|---|---|---|
| compact.py archival cycles | Sunset clauses, regulatory review | Rule accumulation → bureaucratic overload |
| Concurrent lanes + quorum | Parallel review boards | Sequential bottleneck → latency |
| expect-act-diff protocol | Policy outcome accountability | Unfalsifiable policy → no learning |
| NEXT.md / COLONY.md handoffs | Transition briefings | Context loss → institutional amnesia |
| CHALLENGES.md challenge process | Rule challenge mechanism | Belief lock-in → bad policy persists |
| Anti-windup lane checker | Process stall detection | Zombie processes → resource waste |
| Colony nesting (self-directing) | Federalism / local autonomy | Centralization → bottleneck |
| Distributed beliefs | Decentralized epistemic authority | Single narrative → brittle |
