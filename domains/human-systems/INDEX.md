## Concepts
- **Compaction failure**: Bureaucracies accumulate rules without archival. No compact.py equivalent. (L-407)
- **Sequential bottleneck**: One-approver chains kill throughput. Swarm fix: concurrent quorum. (L-408)
- **Expect-act-diff gap**: Policy without falsifiable outcomes cannot improve. (L-409)
- **Context loss**: Role transitions without structured handoffs cause institutional amnesia. (COLONY.md CB-4)

## Lessons
| ID | Title | Key claim |
|----|-------|-----------|
| L-407 | Bureaucracy as compaction failure | Rules accumulate monotonically; sunset = compact.py |
| L-408 | Swarm→institution transfer map | 8 patterns ranked by transferability |
| L-409 | Expect-act-diff as policy accountability | Falsifiable outcomes required before policy passes |
