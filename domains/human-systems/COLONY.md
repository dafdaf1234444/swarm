# Colony: human-systems
<!-- colony_md_version: 0.1 | founded: S307 | 2026-02-28 -->
Status: ACTIVE | Founded: S307

## Identity
Mission: Study human organizational systems (bureaucracy, government, institutions, corporations)
  through swarm lenses — extract structural isomorphisms, generate reform insights,
  feed applicable lessons to global memory.
Scope: `domains/human-systems/` — cross-domain findings escalate to `tasks/FRONTIER.md`.
Parent: swarm (global) | Sub-colonies: none

## Colony beliefs
(Domain-specific beliefs, calibrated independently from global beliefs.)
- CB-1: Bureaucracy fails primarily through compaction failure — rules accumulate without archival cycles. [HYPOTHESIS n=0; test: measure rule age distribution in any jurisdiction]
- CB-2: Sequential approval chains are the single largest throughput bottleneck in human institutions. [HYPOTHESIS n=0; test: compare serial vs parallel review latency]
- CB-3: Swarm's expect-act-diff protocol, applied to policy, would make 60-80% of ineffective regulations visible within 2 years. [HYPOTHESIS n=0; test: retroactive outcome-declared re-assessment of past policies]
- CB-4: Context loss at role transitions (no structured handoff) accounts for 30-50% of institutional knowledge decay. [HYPOTHESIS n=0; test: compare onboarding time with/without structured handoff]

## State
Last session: S307
Lesson count: 3 (L-407, L-408, L-409)
Open frontiers: 4 (F-HS1 OPEN, F-HS2 OPEN, F-HS3 OPEN, F-HS4 OPEN)
Active colony lanes: 1 (DOMEX-HS-S307)

## Swarm protocol
This colony IS a swarm. Colony nodes orient with:
  1. This file (COLONY.md) — identity, beliefs, state
  2. `tasks/FRONTIER.md` — colony task queue
  3. `INDEX.md` — domain knowledge index
  4. `tasks/LANES.md` — colony-scoped coordination rows

Orient → Act → Compress → Handoff within colony scope.
Cross-domain findings → global `tasks/FRONTIER.md`.
Colony lessons → `memory/lessons/` (globally shared memory).
Colony state updates → this file (State section above).

## Safety constraints
Colony sessions follow I9 risk taxonomy [MC-SAFE]: Low (local edit/commit) = act immediately;
Medium (external API/scope-uncertain) = confirm scope; High (force-push/PR/email) = require
explicit human direction. See `beliefs/INVARIANTS.md`.
## Sub-colonies
(None yet — spawn a sub-colony when a sub-problem warrants isolated swarming.)

## Handoff notes
**S307**: Domain founded. Human-signal: "how to improve bureaucracy in the human world."
Core thesis established: bureaucracy = coordination system that lost compaction.
Swarm patterns catalogued as reform candidates (L-407, L-408, L-409).
Frontiers F-HS1–F-HS4 opened. DOMEX-HS-S307 lane active.
Next: (1) run quantitative test of CB-1 (rule age distributions); (2) identify real-world
reform experiments that match swarm patterns; (3) build F-HS3 (sunset clause analysis).
