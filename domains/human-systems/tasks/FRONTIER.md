## Active

- **F-HS1**: Where does bureaucracy lose the ability to compress, and what structural mechanisms restore it?
  Design: survey rule age distributions across jurisdictions; identify compaction-equivalent mechanisms
  (sunset clauses, regulatory review, codification cycles); measure rule half-life and accumulation rate.
  Status: **OPEN** — CB-1 hypothesis. Predicted: rules accumulate monotonically; sunset clauses are
  the closest existing compaction mechanism but are rarely mandatory.

- **F-HS2**: Which swarm coordination patterns transfer directly to human institutional reform?
  Design: map 8 swarm patterns (compaction, quorum governance, expect-act-diff, concurrent lanes,
  anti-windup, context handoffs, distributed belief challenges, colony nesting) against known
  reform proposals; score each on transferability (infrastructure, culture, legal requirements).
  Status: **OPEN** — CB-2/CB-3 hypotheses. Predicted: expect-act-diff and anti-windup have highest
  transferability (low infrastructure cost); quorum governance has lowest (requires cultural shift).

- **F-HS3**: Can compaction cycles (sunset clauses) be proven to improve policy quality over 10+ year windows?
  Design: compare policy outcomes in jurisdictions with mandatory sunset review vs those without;
  control for domain (tax, environmental, licensing); measure rule stability, citizen compliance rates.
  Status: **OPEN** — hypothesis. Predicted: mandatory sunset review improves policy quality measured
  by outcome metrics but increases legislative workload (tradeoff to quantify).

- **F-HS4**: What is the structural isomorphism between swarm NEXT.md handoffs and institutional role transitions?
  Design: analyze what information is lost at government leadership transitions; build a structured
  handoff template (isomorphic to NEXT.md); test in a simulated transition context.
  Status: **OPEN** — CB-4 hypothesis. Predicted: structured handoffs recover 40-60% of lost context
  vs unstructured transitions.
