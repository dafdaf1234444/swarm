## Isomorphism vocabulary
ISO-5 (feedback): structural signal decay → cascade failure; coordination without feedback → convergence failure pattern
ISO-5: failure cascade → stigmergy decay; redundancy restores structural coordination signal across cycles
ISO-4 (phase transition): coordination threshold → structural phase; coupling signal crosses critical cascade boundary
ISO-4: consensus protocol → coordination convergence; structural cycles signal phase transition in coordination pattern
ISO-12: structural bottleneck → coordination failure cascade; redundancy compression determines convergence threshold
ISO-11: cascade failure propagates through structural coupling → convergence requires coordination signal pattern
