# Domain: Dream / Generative Recombination
Topic: Undirected generative synthesis — recombining lessons, beliefs, and domain knowledge in novel configurations, unconstrained by active task directives. Structural isomorphisms from REM sleep neuroscience: replay without goal, associative memory binding, counterfactual simulation, noise-driven creativity. The swarm's offline/latent creativity mode.
Beliefs: B-DRM1 (latent synthesis: unconstrained recombination produces novel cross-domain connections not found by directed search, THEORIZED), B-DRM2 (noise-as-signal: deliberately introducing variation reveals fragile beliefs and hidden assumptions, THEORIZED), B-DRM3 (consolidation via play: revisiting knowledge without task pressure deepens structural understanding, THEORIZED)
Lessons: (pending — L-DRM1+ to be assigned from dream experiment artifacts)
Frontiers: F-DRM1 (does undirected recombination produce actionable cross-domain isomorphisms not reachable by directed domain experts?), F-DRM2 (which beliefs are fragile — do counterfactual dream sessions surface more CHALLENGES.md entries than directed sessions?), F-DRM3 (can dreaming generate new frontier questions at a higher rate than task-directed sessions?)
Experiments: experiments/dream/

## What dreaming means here
Not a metaphor — a structural analog to REM sleep. REM is characterized by:
1. **Replay without external input**: memory traces replayed in random order; not goal-directed
2. **Associative binding**: hippocampus binds disparate memory fragments across context
3. **Counterfactual simulation**: "what if" scenarios that never happened
4. **Noise injection**: random activation allows escape from local attractors
5. **Emotional tagging reduction**: executive control suppressed; uncensored combinations

Swarm dream mode mirrors this:
1. Pull **random lessons** from `memory/lessons/` (not recently cited, not priority)
2. Recombine across **unrelated domains** (e.g., evolution + finance + linguistics)
3. Ask **counterfactuals**: "what if CORE principle 3 were inverted?"
4. **Amplify weak signals**: look for THEORIZED beliefs that have no follow-up experiments
5. **No task pressure**: dream output is exploratory, labeled `DREAM-HYPOTHESIS`, low commitment

## Domain filter
Dream domain is NOT for:
- Task-directed work (use existing DOMEX lanes)
- Validating known isomorphisms (use domain experts)
- Coordinator/relay functions

Dream domain IS for:
- Novel connection hypotheses between 3+ previously unconnected domains
- Surfacing fragile/untested beliefs via counterfactual stress
- Generating new frontier questions not reachable by current directed search
- "What is the swarm missing?" sessions with no predetermined answer

## Core isomorphisms

| Dream / REM concept | Swarm parallel | Status |
|--------------------|----------------|--------|
| **Replay without goal** (hippocampal replay during slow-wave sleep; sequences replayed in reverse/random order) | Dream session: pull lessons by random index, not by priority; recombine without directive | STRUCTURAL ANALOG — to be tested (F-DRM1) |
| **Memory consolidation at rest** (synaptic homeostasis: weak synapses pruned during sleep; important ones strengthened) | Dream session surfaces THEORIZED beliefs never experimentally tested → promotes or prunes | STRUCTURAL ANALOG — THEORIZED |
| **Counterfactual simulation** (prefrontal deactivation during REM allows impossible scenarios to run; basis of creative insight) | Invert a CORE.md principle, simulate what breaks; write DREAM-HYPOTHESIS challenges | STRUCTURAL ANALOG — to be tested (F-DRM2) |
| **Default mode network** (DMN active at rest; self-referential; mind-wandering enables creative recombination) | Meta-reflection at session end; dream sessions ARE pure DMN — no active task suppression | STRUCTURAL PARALLEL (see brain domain) |
| **Sleep-dependent learning transfer** (skill learned before sleep transfers better to new contexts post-sleep) | Dream session re-reads recent lessons → writes cross-domain hypotheses → next directed session tests them | TRANSFER MECHANISM — THEORIZED |

## Critical direction implications
1. **Directed search has a coverage floor**: domain experts find what they're looking for. Dream sessions find what nobody is looking for. The two modes are complementary, not competing.
2. **THEORIZED belief debt**: ~60% of swarm beliefs are THEORIZED (B-BRN1, B-BRN2, B-BRN3, etc.). Dream sessions systematically tour these and either generate experiment proposals or escalate to CHALLENGES.md.
3. **Frontier generation rate**: current F-NNN density ≈ 23 open questions. Hypothesis (F-DRM3): a dream session produces ≥2 new frontier questions per session at lower cost than a directed session.
4. **Dream output is cheap to generate, expensive to ignore**: a single unexpected connection can redirect a domain for 10 sessions. The cost of not dreaming = growing blind spots.

## Isomorphism vocabulary
ISO-14 (recursive self-similarity): dream.py → swarm dreams about swarm; recursive self-reference; part contains the whole
ISO-7 (emergence): cross-domain synthesis → emergent insights irreducible to individual domain knowledge; resonance = emergent connection
ISO-10 (predict-error-revise): hypothesis generation → predict-error-revise at meta level; dream cycle tests swarm beliefs against cross-domain patterns
ISO-3 (hierarchical compression): dream synthesis → MDL compression across domains; resonance = common compressed structure underlying diverse observations
ISO-2 (selection → attractor): hypothesis competition → selection pressure on generated hypotheses; strongest cross-domain pattern survives
ISO-16 (inferential compounding): cross-domain resonance → inferential compounding; each ISO match expands answerable-question space
