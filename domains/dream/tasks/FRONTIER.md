# Dream Domain — Frontier Questions
Domain agent: write here for dream-specific questions; cross-domain findings go to tasks/FRONTIER.md

- **F-DRM1**: Does undirected recombination (dream sessions) produce actionable cross-domain isomorphisms not reachable by directed domain experts? **Hypothesis**: random lesson sampling + cross-domain pairing surfaces ≥1 connection per session that no directed expert would have found. **Test**: run 3 dream sessions; for each novel connection proposed, check if any existing domain FRONTIER.md or NEXT.md mentions it. Count "genuinely new" (not referenced anywhere) vs "rediscovery" (already known). **Success criterion**: ≥50% of dream-session hypotheses are genuinely new cross-domain connections. **Related**: B-DRM1, F-EVO1 (diversity-yield correlation), F-QC1 (repeated knowledge).

- **F-DRM2**: Which swarm beliefs are fragile — do dream sessions (counterfactual inversion) surface more CHALLENGES.md entries than directed sessions? **Hypothesis**: directed sessions find what they look for; dream sessions find what nobody is checking. **Test**: in each dream session, invert 1-2 CORE.md or DEPS.md beliefs and simulate consequences. Count belief challenges generated per session (dream vs recent directed average). **Current baseline**: CHALLENGES.md pending — check before first dream session. **Related**: B-DRM2, CHALLENGES.md, beliefs/DEPS.md.

- **F-DRM3**: Can dreaming generate new frontier questions at a higher rate per token than task-directed sessions? **Hypothesis**: dream sessions (no specific task) are cheaper to run and produce more F-NNN entries per session than directed sessions. **Test**: measure F-NNN entries added per dream session; compare to 5-session rolling average from directed sessions. **Current baseline**: directed sessions add ~0.3 new F-NNN per session (23 open / ~80 sessions since F system created). **Related**: B-DRM3, tasks/FRONTIER.md count history.
