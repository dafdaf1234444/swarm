# Dream Domain Index
Updated: 2026-02-28 S190 | Seeded by dream-expert initialization

## What this domain knows
- **Dream = swarm REM mode**: undirected generative recombination across lessons/domains/beliefs
- **5 structural analogs** mapped from REM neuroscience to swarm operation
- **3 core beliefs**: B-DRM1 (latent synthesis), B-DRM2 (noise-as-signal), B-DRM3 (consolidation via play) — all THEORIZED, require experimental validation
- **3 open frontier questions**: F-DRM1 (recombination yield), F-DRM2 (belief fragility detection), F-DRM3 (frontier generation rate)
- **Key insight**: ~60% of swarm beliefs are THEORIZED with no follow-up experiments — dream sessions are the mechanism to surface and test them

## Isomorphism status

| REM concept | Swarm parallel | Verified? |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Replay without goal | Random lesson recombination (not priority-driven) | NOT YET — F-DRM1 |
| Memory consolidation at rest | THEORIZED belief surfacing + promotion/pruning | NOT YET |
| Counterfactual simulation | CORE principle inversion + DREAM-HYPOTHESIS | NOT YET — F-DRM2 |
| Default mode network | Dream sessions = pure DMN activation | STRUCTURAL (see brain domain B-DMN) |
| Sleep-dependent transfer | Dream → directed session → better test | NOT YET — F-DRM3 |

## Lessons from this domain
(none yet — first dream sessions will produce L-DRM1+)

## Cross-domain hooks
- Brain domain: sleep consolidation ↔ compaction; DMN ↔ meta-reflection (F-BRN2, F-BRN3)
- Evolution domain: variation injection ↔ noise-as-signal (B-DRM2); drift vs selection
- Psychology domain: insight problem-solving; incubation effect; unconscious thought theory
- Quality domain: undirected sessions may surface repeated-knowledge patterns (F-QC1)
- Meta domain: dream sessions are self-model stress tests — what does the swarm think it knows?
