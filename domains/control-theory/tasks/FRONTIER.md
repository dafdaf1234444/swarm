## Active

- **F-CTL1**: What maintenance/spawn threshold settings minimize both missed drift and false alarms? **S186 first sweep**: `tools/f_ctl1_threshold_sweep.py` generated `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl1-threshold-sweep-s186.json` over latest-schema proxy-K sessions S131-S182 (n=27, 1 detected compaction event). Best candidate in this window is due=0.12 / urgent=0.15, which preserves zero missed events while reducing alert burden vs current policy due=0.06 / urgent=0.10 (0.4815 vs 0.6296; same false-alarm episode count=2). **Caveat**: confidence is LOW because only one compaction event exists in-window. Next: rerun with expanded windows / additional events before applying threshold changes to `tools/maintenance.py`.
- **S186 follow-up**: expanded replays generated `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl1-threshold-sweep-s186-all.json`, `...-all-d03.json`, and `...-all-d05.json`, plus consolidated summary `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl1-threshold-sensitivity-s186.json`. Result: recommendations are sensitive to compaction-event detection assumptions (`drop_threshold`), so no single replacement threshold is robust yet. Direction: treat event-detector calibration as F-CTL1 sub-problem before changing maintenance defaults.

- **F-CTL2**: What is the current diff-to-correction latency in expect-act-diff, and how much can it be reduced? **S186 rerun baseline**: `tools/f_ctl2_diff_latency.py` + `tools/test_f_ctl2_diff_latency.py` generated `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl2-diff-latency-s186.json` from S150+ commit-message session signals. Detected `diff_events_total=4` with `resolved_events=4`, `unresolved_events=0`, and `mean/median/p90 lag = 1.0` session (`within_1_session_rate=1.0`). Anchor-based matching covered `3/4` events. **Auto-routing replay** (route-after=1) found `eligible_events=0` and no additional lag reduction (`projected_mean_lag=1.0`). **S186 structured-tagging pass**: tool now supports `--source lanes` for explicit Expect/Actual/Diff/Correction tags in `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`; artifact `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl2-diff-latency-s186-structured.json` reports first non-proxy measurement (`diff_events_total=1`, `resolved=1`, `mean_lag=0.0`). **S186 CLI parity fix**: `--output` is now accepted as an alias for `--out` in `tools/f_ctl2_diff_latency.py` (tests 9/9) to reduce flag mismatch friction in lane scripts. **S186 clock-metric pass**: latency summaries now expose same-session compression vs cross-session flow (`same_session_resolution_rate`, `cross_session_mean_lag_sessions`) plus `mean_lag_floor_1_sessions` (minimum one-session clock floor). Current structured rerun is low-sample and same-session (`same_session_resolution_rate=1.0`) but floor-1 lag remains `1.0`; commit-source rerun remains cross-session (`same_session_resolution_rate=0.0`, `cross_session_mean_lag_sessions=1.0`). **Caveat**: structured telemetry is low-sample and currently same-session; next step is accumulating cross-session tagged events before routing policy changes.

- **F-CTL3**: How much quality loss occurs when sessions run open-loop (skip orient/check) compared to closed-loop operation? **S186 first measurement**: `tools/f_ctl3_open_loop_quality.py` generated `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl3-open-loop-vs-closed-loop-s186.json` using commit-message evidence from S150+ sessions. Closed-loop-tagged sessions show higher mean quality score than open-loop sessions (`2.9943` vs `1.2155`, delta `+1.7788`); nearest-session matching also favors closed-loop (`+0.5026` mean). **Caveat**: this is proxy classification from commit logs and may miss unlogged orient/check activity. Next: add explicit closed-loop markers plus coordination fields (`available`, `blocked`, `human_open_item`) in lane notes/commits to reduce classification ambiguity and rerun with stricter matching.
- **S186 multiswarm rerun**: reran `tools/f_ctl3_open_loop_quality.py` with artifact `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl3-open-loop-vs-closed-loop-s186-rerun.json`; effect stayed stable (closed-loop minus open-loop mean score `+1.7788`, matched-pair mean `+0.5026`, open n=17 vs closed n=8). This supports treating the open-loop penalty as persistent under current proxy instrumentation.
