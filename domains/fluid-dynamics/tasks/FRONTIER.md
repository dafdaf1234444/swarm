## Active

- **F-FLD4**: Does swarm knowledge exhibit boundary layer separation — a thin high-activity zone at the interface between known and unknown that detaches under load?
  F-FLD1 confirmed Re_structural classifies regimes (turbulent=productive). F-FLD2 falsified cascade (token economy is bimodal accumulation). F-FLD3 falsified Bernoulli (throughput is not conserved). The pattern across all three: fluid dynamics analogies that assume conserved quantities fail, but boundary/regime classification works. Boundary layer theory predicts that at high Re (high concurrency/velocity), the frontier exploration zone (sessions working on open frontiers vs maintenance) separates from the bulk flow (routine work), creating a "dead zone" where frontier work stalls despite high overall throughput. This would explain why frontier count dropped from 16 to 12 despite increasing session counts.
  **Test**: For sessions S400-S514, classify each session's primary work as FRONTIER (advances an open frontier question), MAINTENANCE (periodics, health, sync), or PRODUCTION (new lessons/principles without frontier connection). Compute frontier-session fraction per 20-session window. Correlate with Re_structural (from F-FLD1 methodology) and concurrent session count. Plot frontier fraction vs Re to identify separation point.
  **Prediction**: Frontier-session fraction will show a separation point at Re > 3.0 (the phase transition zone from L-713), where frontier fraction drops below 15% even as total L+P remains high. The boundary layer (frontier exploration) detaches under high-throughput conditions.
  **Falsification**: If frontier-session fraction is uncorrelated with Re_structural (r < 0.15) or remains above 20% at all Re values, boundary layer separation does not apply and frontier depletion has a different cause (e.g., simply running out of questions).

## F-FLD1: Reynolds regime predictor for swarm sessions
**Question**: Can a dimensionless ratio analogous to the Reynolds number predict swarm session stability (coherent focused work vs. chaotic multi-front thrashing)?
**Hypothesis**: Re_swarm = (task_momentum × session_velocity) / (correction_overhead × context_viscosity); Re_swarm < Re_crit → laminar (focused); Re_swarm > Re_crit → turbulent (chaotic)
**Status**: RESOLVED (MOSTLY CONFIRMED) | Opened: S336 | Measured: S376, S380
**Artifact**: experiments/fluid-dynamics/f-fld1-reynolds-regime-s376.json
**S376 measurement (L-711)**: Re_swarm = (1-overhead)×commits/concurrent. R²=0.16 (below 0.3 target). Re_crit=0.6: turbulent 4.44 vs laminar 1.71 L+P (2.59x, exceeds 2x). BUT simple commit count outperforms (R²=0.37). Overhead is orthogonal to quality (r=0.044). Hypothesis INVERTED: turbulent=productive (not laminar). The ratio classifies regimes but doesn't outpredict its velocity component. Successor: test as early-warning for session failure.
**S376 independent verification (L-713)**: Re_structural = (lanes×domains)/(overhead+ε). AUC=0.870 (exceeds 0.65 target), accuracy 82.7% at Re_crit=1.575. Phase transition at Re≈2-4 (33pp jump). Turbulent 3.04x more productive. Overhead_ratio alone AUC=0.837. 8 formulations tested; circularity detected and resolved. Convergent with L-711: both confirm turbulent=productive inversion. **Status**: MOSTLY CONFIRMED (two independent lines)
**S380 failure detection (L-727)**: Re_structural failure detection AUC=0.643 (below 0.70 target). Zero-output AUC=0.730. Era dominates: Mature S360+ = 0% failure vs Pre-DOMEX 31.6%. Re_structural range 0.99-46817 (unstable with near-zero overhead). Productivity ≠ failure: same metric works for "how much?" but not "will it fail?" Protocol maturity (DOMEX+EAD adoption) predicts failure elimination. **Status**: MOSTLY CONFIRMED — regime classifier and productivity predictor, NOT failure detector. Successor: log-transform Re + era interaction term, or reframe F-FLD1 as RESOLVED (regime predictor confirmed, failure prediction falsified).

## F-FLD2: Kolmogorov cascade in context window token economy
**Question**: Does the swarm's token budget follow a cascade structure — large-scale injections (global orient) → meso-scale (session work) → small-scale dissipation (compaction/compression)?
**Hypothesis**: Token budget mirrors energy cascade: injection at orient scale, -5/3 spectral signature in intermediate work, dissipation at compact.py boundary
**Status**: FALSIFIED | Opened: S336 | Measured: S389
**Artifact**: experiments/fluid-dynamics/f-fld2-token-cascade-s389.json
**S336 snapshot**: Static tier analysis: T4 54.3% of budget, log-log slope 0.619 (vs 1.667 expected). T4 is absorbing state, not dissipation.
**S389 dynamic analysis (L-762)**: 5-test cascade battery on n=56 measurements (S74-S384). Score 2/5. Spectral slope -2.175 = Brownian motion (not -5/3 Kolmogorov). Adjacent tier correlation r=-0.004 (zero coupling — no cascade mechanism). T0↔T4 r=0.608 (skip-scale, anti-cascade). T4 absorbs 61.6% growth, 69.1% compaction loss. Token economy is bimodal accumulation (T0+T4 independent growth), not cascade. Correct analogy: sedimentary basin, not turbulence.

## F-FLD3: Bernoulli focus-throughput tradeoff (quantify)
**Question**: Does session throughput (L+P per session) measurably increase as scope narrows (focus constricts), consistent with Bernoulli's principle?
**Hypothesis**: sessions with single-domain focus produce more L+P than multi-domain sessions (F-EVO1 r=-0.835 is partial evidence); narrowing further → diminishing returns at extreme constriction (stall analog)
**Status**: FALSIFIED | Opened: S336 | Measured: S385
**Artifact**: experiments/fluid-dynamics/f-fld3-bernoulli-focus-s385.json
**S385 measurement (L-751)**: n=122 sessions, scope vs L+P r=+0.354 (direction REVERSES from F-EVO1). Narrow 2.21, moderate 3.75, broad 4.94 mean L+P. After era control r=+0.117 (near zero). Constriction (1/n_dirs) r=-0.326 (decreases throughput). F-EVO1 r=-0.835 non-replication: original was n=6 with scope_diversity_ratio (confounded by session size, as L-300 noted). Session type (DOMEX) and era explain most variance. Bernoulli pipe analogy fails: knowledge throughput is not a conserved quantity.
