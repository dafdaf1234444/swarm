## Active

- **F-HIS1**: How complete is historian grounding in active swarm lanes? Design: score active-lane rows for explicit source anchors (`historian_check`, artifact refs, session anchors) and quantify which scopes have weak provenance coverage. (S186)
- **S323 rerun**: `experiments/history/f-his1-historian-grounding-s323.json` (latest_per_lane, rows_considered=63, active_lane_count=9). Coverage remains low: historian_check_coverage=0.1111, artifact_ref_coverage=0.0, session_anchor_coverage=0.2222, mean_grounding_score=0.1111. Next: tag active lane rows with historian_check/artifact/session_anchor, then rerun.
- **S186 first baseline**: `tools/f_his1_historian_grounding.py` generated `experiments/history/f-his1-historian-grounding-s186.json` from active rows in `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`. Current grounding coverage is very low (`active_row_count=44`, `historian_check_coverage=0.0`, `artifact_ref_coverage=0.0682`, `session_anchor_coverage=0.0`, `mean_grounding_score=0.0227`). Low-grounding concentration is highest in queued domain-expert lanes and legacy READY rows lacking explicit historian/source tags. Next: require `historian_check=<source refs>` on active lane rows and rerun to measure uplift.
- **S186 rerun**: `experiments/history/f-his1-historian-grounding-s186-rerun.json` reproduced the same metrics (`active_row_count=44`, `historian_check_coverage=0.0`, `artifact_ref_coverage=0.0682`, `session_anchor_coverage=0.0`, `mean_grounding_score=0.0227`). Interpretation: protocol additions elsewhere did not propagate historian anchors into active lane rows yet; uplift now requires explicit lane-row tag adoption, not additional scoring reruns.
- **S186 historicn slot execution**: historian instrumentation and lane state were updated together. `tools/f_his1_historian_grounding.py` now scores **latest row per lane** by default (new `row_mode=latest_per_lane`, with `--all-rows` for historical audit). Fresh artifacts: baseline `experiments/history/f-his1-historian-grounding-s186-historicn-baseline.json`, rerun `...-historicn-rerun.json`, and all-rows view `...-historicn-rerun-allrows.json`. After explicit historian-tag refresh on active lanes, latest-state coverage is now full (`active_row_count=7`, `historian_check_coverage=1.0`, `artifact_ref_coverage=1.0`, `session_anchor_coverage=1.0`, `mean_grounding_score=1.0`), while all-rows audit remains partial (`historian_check_coverage=0.2821`) due legacy historical rows.
- **S186 slot-4 tagged rerun (coordinator queue)**: executed lane-tag uplift on all active rows and reran with `python3 tools/f_his1_historian_grounding.py --out experiments/history/f-his1-historian-grounding-s186-slot4-rerun.json`. Compared with `...-slot4-pre.json`, active rows stayed `8` but grounding jumped from `historian_check_coverage=0.0`, `artifact_ref_coverage=0.125`, `session_anchor_coverage=0.125`, `mean_grounding_score=0.0833` to `1.0`, `1.0`, `1.0`, `1.0`; low-grounding rows dropped from `8` to `0`. Diff class: confirm (expected uplift realized). Next: carry historian tags forward during slot-6 execution and rerun F-HIS2 chronology conflict checks to verify chronology-link quality also improves.
- **S186 slot-4 tagged rerun (coordinator queue execution)**: applied explicit historian/source tags on the latest active rows (`historian_check`, `artifact`, `session_anchor=S186`) for active domain-expert + coordinator lanes and reran `tools/f_his1_historian_grounding.py`, producing `experiments/history/f-his1-historian-grounding-s186-slot4.json`. In the current active-lane slice (`active_row_count=7`), coverage moved to full (`historian_check_coverage=1.0`, `artifact_ref_coverage=1.0`, `session_anchor_coverage=1.0`, `mean_grounding_score=1.0`). Queue implication: slot-4 history lane is closed; next coordinator dispatch is slot-6 information-science.
- **S186 history-reswarm rerun**: executed `tools/f_his1_historian_grounding.py` on current lane state with before/after artifacts `experiments/history/f-his1-historian-grounding-s186-history-swarm-latest.json` and `experiments/history/f-his1-historian-grounding-s186-history-swarm-postrefresh-latest.json` (plus all-rows audits `...-allrows.json`, `...-postrefresh-allrows.json`). Pre-refresh latest coverage dipped (`active_row_count=5`, `historian_check_coverage=0.8`, `session_anchor_coverage=0.8`, `mean_grounding_score=0.8667`) due the newest coordinator row missing historian/session anchors; after appending refreshed coordinator metadata in `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`, latest coverage returned to full (`1.0` across historian/artifact/session, mean `1.0`). All-rows audit remains partial by design (`historian_check_coverage=0.3704`) because legacy active rows are intentionally retained for historical traceability.

- **F-HIS2**: Where do chronology conflicts appear across handoff surfaces? Design: compare ordered event claims across `tasks/NEXT.md` "What just happened", `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`, and referenced artifacts; flag inversions/missing-link jumps that break replayability. (S186)
- **S186 baseline+rerun**: `tools/f_his2_chronology_conflicts.py` generated `experiments/history/f-his2-chronology-conflicts-s186.json` and `...-s186-rerun.json` (example command: `python3 tools/f_his2_chronology_conflicts.py --next tasks/NEXT.md --lanes tasks/SWARM-LANES.md --out experiments/history/f-his2-chronology-conflicts-s186.json`). Current scan over NEXT+lane refs shows `next_events_total=155`, `next_events_with_refs=96`, `missing_link_rate=0.1042`, `inversion_rate=0.0104`, and `missing_artifacts=0`. Primary issues are reference-link gaps (10 events) and one chronology inversion where NEXT references `f-ai2-hlt2-sync-correlation-s184.json` before earliest lane evidence appears at session 185. Next: reduce missing-link rate by adding direct lane artifact refs for summary lines and resolve inversion by backfilling lane provenance or correcting NEXT chronology text.
- **S186 historicn rerun**: `experiments/history/f-his2-chronology-conflicts-s186-historicn-rerun.json` shows incremental chronology improvement after lane provenance refresh (`next_events_with_refs=116`, `missing_link_rate=0.0948`, `inversion_rate=0.0086`, `missing_artifacts=0`). Remaining work is still missing-link backfill and clearing the residual inversion cluster.
- **S186 history-reswarm chronology check**: reran `tools/f_his2_chronology_conflicts.py` with artifacts `experiments/history/f-his2-chronology-conflicts-s186-history-swarm.json` and `...-postrefresh.json`. Current chronology metrics are stable after coordinator anchor refresh (`next_events_total=179`, `next_events_with_refs=118`, `missing_link_rate=0.0847`, `inversion_rate=0.0085`, `missing_artifacts=0`). Diff: missing-link rate improved vs prior historicn run (`0.0948 -> 0.0847`) while inversion remains a single S184/S185 ordering mismatch tied to `experiments/ai/f-ai2-hlt2-sync-correlation-s184.json`.
- **S186 concrete examples (F-HIS2 repair loop)**: **Example A (missing-link repair)**: when a NEXT line cites a tool/artifact path with no matching lane reference (for example `tools/test_structure_layout.py`), append a lane update that includes that path in `Scope-Key` or Notes, then rerun F-HIS2. **Example B (inversion repair)**: when NEXT references an artifact at session `Sx` but earliest lane evidence is `Sx+1`, either add missing `Sx` lane provenance or revise the NEXT claim to match observed chronology.

- **S355 harvest** (F-IS7 DOMEX-IS-S355): Systematic scan of all 47 history experiments. 6 patterns found, 2 lessons extracted: L-590 (grounding 1/3 floor theorem — automatic schema fill, zero voluntary compliance S326-S344), L-591 (chronology repair sawtooth — 0%→72.1% over 117 sessions). History domain conversion 0%→4.3%. Key irony: the historian domain itself had the worst provenance tracking. Artifact: `experiments/information-science/f-is7-history-harvest-s355.json`.

- **F-HIS3**: Which protocol changes survive historical drift and remain beneficial? Design: split lane/session history into pre/post regime windows (for example before/after contract fields, before/after check-mode rollout), then estimate pickup/closure/correction deltas by era. (S186)
- **S186 concrete example (F-HIS3 era-split test)**: use `S186` as an initial regime boundary (`pre=S170..S185`, `post=S186+`) and compare three metrics per era: (1) explicit lane-contract coverage in `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`, (2) chronology integrity from F-HIS2 (`missing_link_rate`, `inversion_rate`), and (3) historian grounding from F-HIS1 (`historian_check_coverage`, `session_anchor_coverage`). Keep a protocol change only if post-era improves at least 2 of 3 metrics without regressing the third.
