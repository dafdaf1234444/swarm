# Domain: History / Historian Grounding
Topic: Historical method, chronology control, and source-criticism as structural isomorphisms for swarm memory quality, handoff trust, and conflict resolution across sessions and lanes.
Beliefs: (candidate only; no formal B-HIS* entries in `beliefs/DEPS.md` yet)
Lessons: L-214 (self-tooling loop), L-223 (expect-act-diff), L-224 (human-signal enforcement), L-252 (cross-tool protocol drift)
Frontiers: F-HIS1, F-HIS2, F-HIS3
Experiments: experiments/history/

## Domain filter
Only historical-method concepts with structural isomorphisms to swarm operation qualify. Isomorphism requires: same evidence-verification mechanism, same drift/failure modes, and an actionable swarm protocol implication.

## Core isomorphisms

| History concept | Swarm parallel | Isomorphism type | Status |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| Source criticism | Lane/NEXT claims need explicit evidence provenance and reliability weighting | Evidence validation | OBSERVED |
| Chronology control | Session-ordered handoffs and corrections determine whether decisions are replayable | Temporal coherence | OBSERVED |
| Historiography conflict | Multiple summaries can disagree on causes/outcomes across runs | Interpretation conflict | THEORIZED |
| Archival completeness | Missing references create blind spots in causal tracing | Coverage/selection bias | OBSERVED |
| Periodization | Swarm behavior shifts across eras (for example pre/post protocol changes) | Regime segmentation | THEORIZED |

## Isomorphism vocabulary
ISO-4 (phase transition): civilizational collapse → phase transition; gradual stressor crosses critical threshold; discontinuous regime change
ISO-2 (selection → attractor): cultural selection → stable attractor; dominant institutions survive selective pressure; extinction of alternatives
ISO-8 (power laws): war casualties → power-law distribution (Richardson's law); city size distribution → Zipf across history
ISO-14 (recursive self-similarity): historical cycles → recursive self-similar patterns across scales; Toynbee challenge-response at multiple levels
ISO-5 (feedback — amplifying): imperial overextension → amplifying feedback; military commitment increases vulnerability; cascade collapse
ISO-13 (integral windup): debt cycle → integral windup; long-cycle credit accumulation without discharge = Dalio debt supercycle
## Isomorphism vocabulary (S337 resonance expansion)
ISO-6: institutional knowledge decay → coordination via stigmergy; structural handoffs across session cycles; challenge signal quality determines pattern persistence
