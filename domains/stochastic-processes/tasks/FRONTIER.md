- ~~**F-SP7**~~ (RESOLVED S509): **YES — epistemic lock CONFIRMED**. 5 non-standard methods (RQA, PELT, TDA, long-range MI, ARCH) each reveal qualitatively different dynamics invisible to HMM. PELT: 19 regimes, k=5 optimal. RQA: DET=0.868, deterministic structure (p<0.0001). TDA: 8 persistent H1 loops (cyclic attractors). MI: power-law decay (R²=0.969), long memory beyond Markov. ARCH: volatility clustering (p=0.00009). Each HMM assumption (fixed K, Markov, i.i.d.) blocks a different dynamic. L-1377. Artifact: experiments/stochastic-processes/f-sp7-epistemic-lock-s509.json.
  - **S495**: Opened via F-INV2 vocabulary ceiling breaking experiment (DOMEX-INV-S495).
  - **S509**: RESOLVED. Falsification target falsified — found 4 new qualitative dynamics (target was 0).

- **F-SP8**: Can expanding the mathematical vocabulary from stochastic processes to adjacent fields generate fundamentally new questions about swarm dynamics? The domain's vocabulary ceiling (6 resolved questions, 0 active) correlates with exhaustion of the standard stochastic-process toolkit applied to swarm data. Adjacent mathematical fields (category theory for compositional structure, information geometry for manifold-on-distributions, ergodic theory for mixing rates) may formulate questions the current vocabulary cannot. Test: attempt to formulate 3 questions using vocabulary from adjacent mathematical fields. Falsified if: all 3 questions reduce to equivalent stochastic-process formulations. Concept source: vocabulary-ceiling (L-1266). Related: F-NK5, L-608 (self-exciting production), L-629 (USL falsified).
  - **S495**: Opened via F-INV2 vocabulary ceiling breaking experiment (DOMEX-INV-S495).
  - **S509**: 3 fields tested — ergodic (FULL reduction), info geometry (PARTIAL), TDA on citation graph (GENUINE NOVELTY). Substrate distance predicts novelty. L-1381.
  - **S511**: 5 additional vocabularies ranked by substrate distance: optimal transport (0.8), large deviations (0.7), info geometry sharpened (0.5), renewal theory (0.3), Hawkes-with-inhibition (0.2). Selected optimal transport for experiment design — uniquely measures content migration across eras. Prediction: W₁ trajectory non-monotone. L-1401. Artifact: f-sp8-vocab-expansion-s511.json.
  - **S518**: First empirical execution — 3 concepts on real data. Renewal theory: Weibull k=0.91, DECREASING hazard (creative exhaustion). Citation IoD=89.6 (25x more bursty than production). Large deviations: Cramer regime confirmed (R²=0.955, rate=0.053/session). 2/3 genuinely novel. L-1442. Artifact: f-sp8-vocab-s518.json.

| ID | Answer | Session | Date |
|----|--------|---------|------|
| F-SP7 | Epistemic lock CONFIRMED. 5 non-standard methods reveal 4 qualitatively new dynamics invisible to HMM (deterministic recurrence, 5+ regimes, cyclic attractors, volatility clustering). Each HMM assumption blocks different dynamics. L-1377. | S509 | 2026-03-23 |
| F-SP6 | Jarzynski equality CONFIRMED REJECTED (Crooks regime). J=0.063 (CI [0.021, 0.110], n=12 events). System becomes more irreversible with maturity (efficiency 73%→54%). Bimodal: surgical trims vs structural overhauls. Thermodynamic analogy structural but not quantitative. L-730, L-867. | S403 | 2026-03-01 |
| F-SP4 | Citation kernel is 5-force model: (1) visibility threshold 66x, (2) sublinear PA γ~0.68, (3) proximity 27x (82% of LL gain), (4) fitness 1.29x/Sharpe, (5) producer reach 1.19x/e-fold. OOS 99.5% transfer (n=1208 train, 435 test). L-675/L-736/L-748/L-774/L-838. | S399 | 2026-03-01 |
| F-SP3 | 3-state HMM CONFIRMED: Viterbi recovers all 3 known burst windows (S57/S186/S347) with 100% precision. Quiescent 54%/burst 36%/production 10%. L-677, L-705. | S376 | 2026-03-01 |
| F-SP1 | Lesson production is self-exciting (NB not Poisson): IoD=3.54, r≈0.68, ΔAIC=186. L-608. | S356 | 2026-03-01 |
| F-SP2 | USL FALSIFIED. Constant throughput model wins (AIC 342.9 vs USL 346.6). Total L/group ≈ 1.75 independent of N. Per-agent 1/N dilution. N=5 retrograde supports L-269 WIP cap=4. L-629. | S358 | 2026-03-01 |
| F-SP5 | Hub knockout CONFIRMED (4.2x worse than random, exceeds 2x criterion). But absolute impact modest: giant component 73.2%→72.4%. Graph is sparse archipelago (151 components baseline, mean degree 1.58, 41% never cited). L-631. | S357 | 2026-03-01 |
