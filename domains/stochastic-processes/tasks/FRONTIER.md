- **F-SP4**: What is the citation preferential attachment kernel?
  **Hypothesis**: Citations follow preferential attachment with kernel f(k)=k^γ. Measured α=1.903 implies γ≈1.3-1.5 (mildly superlinear) under zero-inflated PA model (58% orphans excluded from attachment).
  **Test**: Build citation DAG. For each lesson L_n, record in-degrees of all prior lessons. Estimate f(k) non-parametrically. Fit 3 models: pure PA, shifted PA, zero-inflated PA. Compare BIC.
  **Evidence**: Cites: fields in all L-NNN.md files.
  **S369 PARTIALLY CONFIRMED**: PA kernel γ=0.61 (SUBLINEAR, R²=0.39, n=979 events, 609 lessons). NOT superlinear as predicted. Zero-inflation CONFIRMED (rate(k≥1)/rate(k=0)=5.07). BIC inconclusive (ΔBIC=-0.47). PA ratio=1.30. Tool: `tools/pa_kernel.py`. L-675. The initial γ estimate from α=1.903 was a substrate error: degree-distribution exponent ≠ attachment kernel exponent.
  **S381 ADVANCED**: Time-varying analysis (n=1043, 536 lessons, 4 eras). γ is NON-STATIONARY: early=0.95, mid=0.97, DOMEX=0.60, recent=1.89. Pre-EAD vs post-EAD Δγ=+0.72 (p=0.004). S369 γ=0.61 correctly captured DOMEX era, not system-wide. Recent superlinear PA driven by hub accumulation from EAD enforcement. L-735.
  **S382 REFINED**: L-735's γ=1.89 is sparse-tail artifact (n=1 at k≥20). Robust gamma (n≥5 filter): 0.63-0.71 consensus across 4 methods (n=1190 events, 662L). Three citation forces: (1) visibility threshold 66x (k=0→k≥1), (2) mild sublinear PA γ~0.68, (3) session proximity 27x (50.4% of citations within 5 sessions). Era: early γ=-0.005 (FLAT), late γ=0.556. Saturation at k=12. L-736.
  **S383 PROXIMITY-CONDITIONED**: Joint model (PA+proximity) is BIC winner (12890 vs PA 14027 vs proximity 13157 vs uniform 14359). n=1208 conditional events, 673L. Proximity explains 82% of LL gain; PA 23%. Key finding: PA gamma INCREASES with distance — near(0-5) γ=0.59, far(21-50) γ=0.95. Two forces in complementary temporal niches: recency for nearby, popularity for distant. Joint γ=0.72, λ=0.016. Confounding fraction only 20% (not confounded — complementary). L-748. Tool: `tools/proximity_pa.py`.
  **Status**: PARTIALLY CONFIRMED (S383 proximity-conditioned) — PA real but secondary (82% proximity); two-force decomposition established; BIC now conclusive for joint model

- **F-SP6**: Does compaction work distribution obey the Jarzynski equality?
  **Hypothesis**: Each compaction event is an irreversible work path. Jarzynski estimator J = ⟨e^{-W/T}⟩ / e^{-ΔF/T} should equal 1.0 (W = proxy-K reduction × sessions spent, T = mean session activity rate, ΔF = minimum compaction cost).
  **Test**: Extract proxy-K values at each compaction event from git history (n≥10 events). Compute work distribution. Estimate J. If J≈1, swarm has well-defined free energy for knowledge compression.
  **Evidence**: proxy-K log, compact.py history, git timestamps.
  **S381 PARTIALLY CONFIRMED**: 9 compaction events (S74-S362). J=0.097 (95% CI [0.031, 0.184] excludes 1.0). Second law holds: <W>=2213t ≥ ΔF=1326t, efficiency 60%. ΔF path-dependent (2.58× ratio small/large). Cumulant expansion fails. Fractional Jarzynski J_rel=0.44, efficiency 82%. Compaction is Crooks-regime (far from equilibrium), not Jarzynski near-equilibrium. L-730.
  **Status**: PARTIALLY CONFIRMED (S381) — thermodynamic analogy structural but not quantitative

| F-SP2 | USL FALSIFIED. Constant throughput model wins (AIC 342.9 vs USL 346.6). Total L/group ≈ 1.75 independent of N. Per-agent 1/N dilution. N=5 retrograde supports L-269 WIP cap=4. L-629. | S358 | 2026-03-01 |
| F-SP5 | Hub knockout CONFIRMED (4.2x worse than random, exceeds 2x criterion). But absolute impact modest: giant component 73.2%→72.4%. Graph is sparse archipelago (151 components baseline, mean degree 1.58, 41% never cited). L-631. | S357 | 2026-03-01 |
