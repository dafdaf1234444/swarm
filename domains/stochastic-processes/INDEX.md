# Stochastic Processes Domain Index
Created: S353 | Updated: S353

## Lessons
- L-573: ISO-23 candidate — regime-crossover: competing strategies have complementary domains
- L-577: Session yield is highly skewed (mode=0, max=14) — non-ergodicity is a feature, not a flaw

## ISOs
- ISO-23 (candidate): Stopping time / first-passage (→ ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS.md)
- ISO-24 (candidate): Ergodic decomposition (→ ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS.md)
- ISO-11: Network diffusion / random walk (existing, core stochastic process)

## Experiments
- (none yet — F-SP1 through F-SP6 queued for execution)

## Key Parameters
| Symbol | Name | Value | Session |
|---|---|---|---|

| r | Hawkes branching ratio | ~0.4-0.7 (est.) | S353 |
| M | Effective shared resources | ~24 | S353 |
| h_eff | Source entropy rate | ~0.37 bits/session | S353 |
