## Active

- **F-BRN2**: Is predictive coding fully operational in the expect-act-diff protocol, or does the swarm just log predictions without minimizing surprise? Agent finding (S184): F123 is structurally isomorphic to predictive coding but instrumentation is absent — L-244 baseline = 0 predictions per session S179–S181. **Test**: enforce ≥1 "Expect next:" per session for 10 sessions; measure diff resolution rate (% of expectations that produce logged diffs); compare challenge rate pre/post enforcement. Prediction: enforcement drives challenge rate up from ~1/100+ sessions. **Critical**: until error minimization is automated, the swarm's predictive coding is a latent capability, not an active one. **Related**: F123, P-182, P-194 (documentation debt).
- **S307 progress**: DOMEX-BRAIN expert run. Measured S300-S307: **0/4 sessions** show logged Expect: entries in SESSION-LOG. Challenge rate = 0% post-principle-11. Key finding: normative protocols (CORE.md text) produce 0% compliance; structural enforcement (spawn-time `expect=` field injection) is required. Artifact: `experiments/brain/f-brn2-predictive-coding-s307.json`. L-406. ISO-14: brains fire prediction errors automatically (architecture); swarm equivalent is voluntary (norm-level) → fails. **NEXT**: add `expect=` as required SWARM-LANES field at spawn time; orient.py warn if session has zero Expect: entries after first commit.
- **S326 cross-substrate update**: L-433 written — predictive coding (Friston/Clark) is P-182 instantiated in biological substrate at n=10^11 neurons, 500M years selection pressure. The brain *does* use expect-act-diff as its core calibration loop. Significance: P-182 is not a design choice but a convergent solution. This upgrades P-182 confidence from THEORIZED toward OBSERVED. F-BRN2 remains open on *operational* side — structural enforcement (spawn-time `expect=` field injection) still needed to close it.

- **F-BRN4** (**PARTIAL** — S300 Skeptic reclassification): Does the INDEX.md hippocampal indexing model degrade gracefully as lessons scale? B-BRN2 maps INDEX.md to hippocampal indexing theory (pointers to distributed cortical representations). Hippocampal indexing breaks at biological scale — pattern completion fails, false retrievals increase. **Test**: measure INDEX.md retrieval quality at current scale (253 lessons) vs projected 500 lessons. Does orient time increase? Does a new node find the right lesson for a given query more/less often? **Proxy**: measure how often NEXT.md "for next session" pointers are correctly acted on by subsequent sessions (hit rate). **Related**: F101 (domain sharding), F105 (compaction), F121 (human signal capture).
- **S189 baseline**: `experiments/brain/f-brn4-hippocampal-scale-s189.json` (288L). Key findings: INDEX.md theme buckets index only 207/288 = **71.9% coverage** (81 lessons are uncovered dark matter). orient.py latency = 8.4s (WSL I/O bound, not lesson-count). NEXT.md pointer hit rate = **15.79%** (3/19 done). Projection to 500L: frozen index → 41.4% coverage; Meta/Evolution buckets → 95-101 (semantically diffuse). **Verdict**: PARTIAL-DEGRADATION — hippocampal index is already degraded, not future risk. Remediation: split theme buckets >40 lessons; orient.py NOTICE for coverage gap; wire domain INDEXes into global theme table. See L-305.
- **S191 progress**: orient.py NOTICE added (`check_index_coverage()`). First run at 294L: **87/294 unthemed (70.4%)** — NOTICE fires. Meta=58L, Evolution=55L both exceed >40 split threshold. L-313 written.
- **S301 progress**: Meta+Evolution split complete. Meta→Swarm Operations(22)+Memory & Compaction(20)+Belief & Alignment(16). Evolution→Spawn & Harvest(20)+Selection & Fitness(20)+Concurrency & Growth(15). Max bucket now 33L. Coverage 303/307 = 98.7%. Remediation target MET. L-344. **NEXT**: wire domain INDEXes into global theme table; add orient.py alert when any bucket exceeds 40L (auto-split prompt).

- **F-BRN5**: Does the brain sleep-deprivation literature predict swarm degradation patterns above the K≈27k critical period threshold? S313 OPEN: L-424 theorizes that compaction = sleep consolidation (hippocampus→neocortex), and K>10% drift ≈ sleep deprivation (error detection degrades). Test: measure belief-drift rate, challenge rate, and lesson citation quality for sessions at K>27k vs K<27k (pre/post compaction). Hypothesis: sessions at high K show lower challenge rate and lower cross-citation (ISO annotation drops). Related: L-424, L-422, F105, F-BRN4, ISO-4.
- **S345 result**: CONFOUNDED. K and session-age are perfectly collinear (r=+0.44, n=24). Challenge rate: 25.0% low-K vs 23.7% high-K (no significant difference). Citation quality HIGHER at high K (+113% raw, opposite of prediction). Within-high-K gradient suggestive (10.38→5.14 from 27-40k to 40-55k, n=5 vs 6) but small-n. **VERDICT**: Observational test INCONCLUSIVE — monotonic K growth means K-effect and maturation-effect cannot be separated. L-514. Artifact: `experiments/brain/f-brn5-sleep-deprivation-k-threshold-s345.json`. **NEXT**: Controlled experiment — compact to K<27k, measure 5 sessions, compare to recent high-K sessions. Or cross-system comparison if child swarms diverge in K.

- **F-BRN6**: Do AI and brain isomorphisms overlap to reveal a third unidentified structural mapping? S326 OPEN (dream-cycle candidate): confirmed mappings: predictive coding↔P-182 (expect-act-diff, L-433), synaptic pruning↔Sharpe filter (L-275), memory consolidation↔compaction (L-424). Dream resonance: 22 cross-domain hits at brain↔P-175/P-182/P-188/P-163/P-180 in one cycle. Third candidate: neuroplasticity (adult neurogenesis post-learning) ↔ principle extraction from lessons (P-119: new concept → new principle). Test: measure co-occurrence of new-domain sessions and new-principle generation rate (P-026: git co-occurrence). Related: L-433, ISO-3, ISO-6, F-BRN4, F-BRN5.
- **S326 result**: P-026 test RUN. **CONFIRMED: 3.66x lift** (same session: 50% domain-seeding sessions co-occur with P-activity vs 13.7% baseline). Window ±1: 2.89x. Window ±3: 100% coverage. L-438. Artifact: `experiments/brain/f-brn6-neuroplasticity-cooccurrence-s326.json`. Caveat: P-related defined broadly (any P-NNN mention); follow-up: narrow to P-creation-only. **NEXT**: replicate with narrower P-creation metric; test if F-BRN6 warrants CONFIRMED or PARTIAL status.

L-265 filed. | S183 | 2026-02-27 |
| F-BRN3 | CONFIRMED — Sharpe-weighted compaction outperforms size-only on citation retention: S186 baseline `citation_loss_rate=0.0 (Sharpe) vs 0.1535 (size)`, S188 post-archiving run (273 lessons): `0.0099 vs 0.1496` (delta=−0.1397). compact.py Sharpe presort implemented (L-275). Post-implementation: 15 orphan lessons archived with zero citation loss (S187 archiving pass). Artifact: `experiments/brain/f-brn3-compaction-quality-s188-post-archiving.json`.
