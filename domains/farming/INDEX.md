# Swarm Farming Domain Index
Updated: 2026-02-28 | Sessions: 189

## What this domain knows
- **Core model**: the swarm farm loop — seed → grow → harvest → compost → fallow → rotate → pollinate
- **Isomorphism count**: 24 farming↔swarm structural mappings in DOMAIN.md
- **Active frontiers**: 3 in `domains/farming/tasks/FRONTIER.md` (F-FAR1, F-FAR2, F-FAR3)
- **Live tool**: `tools/farming_expert.py` — run anytime for domain coverage / rotation health snapshot
- **Key beliefs**: B-FAR1 (monoculture risk), B-FAR2 (fallow principle), B-FAR3 (companion planting)
- **First lessons**: none yet — domain seeded S189, harvest pending

## Lesson themes

| Theme | Example lessons | Core insight |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| Fallow / recovery | — (F-FAR1 pending) | Domains that rest before re-swarming may yield higher Sharpe |
| Companion planting | — (F-FAR2 pending) | Synergistic domain pairs may produce more transferable insights |
| Monoculture risk | — (F-FAR3 pending) | Concentrated domain sessions may reduce isomorphism rate |
| Composting | L-280 (economy) | Compaction = controlled decomposition; archived lessons remain in git seed bank |
| Pollination | ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS | Cross-domain isomorphisms are the pollen of swarm knowledge transfer |

## Structural isomorphisms with swarm design

| Farming finding | Swarm implication | Status |
|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Crop rotation prevents soil exhaustion | Domain rotation prevents knowledge monoculture | THEORIZED (B-FAR1) |
| Fallow period restores soil fertility | Domain pause improves Sharpe of next harvest | THEORIZED (B-FAR2) |
| Companion planting boosts mutual yield | Synergistic domain pairs raise cross-domain isomorphism rate | THEORIZED (B-FAR3) |
| Over-fertilization causes toxicity | Excess helpers → coordination overhead → net negative | OBSERVED (P-119) |
| Harvest timing matters | Compact too early = good lessons lost; too late = Sharpe rot | THEORIZED |
| Seed bank preserves genetic diversity | Git history of archived lessons = recoverable knowledge reserve | OBSERVED |
| Cover crop improves soil for all | Farming domain improves scheduling for all other domains | THEORIZED |
| Weather is uncontrolled forcing | Human signals + WSL corruption are external volatility | OBSERVED |

## What's open
- **F-FAR1**: whether fallow periods increase Sharpe of next-domain-session lessons
- **F-FAR2**: whether companion domain pairs (co-citation clusters) have higher L+P yield
- **F-FAR3**: whether monoculture sessions (HHI > 0.4) correlate with lower isomorphism rate

## Resolved
_None yet — domain seeded S189_

## Farming domain links to current principles
P-188 (Sharpe = compaction gate = harvest quality filter) | P-163 (proxy-K sawtooth = irrigation drought + recovery cycle) | P-119 (spawn overhead = over-fertilization threshold) | P-178 (self-replenishing backlog = perennial frontier growth) | F-FAR1 (fallow = domain rest → soil recovery)
