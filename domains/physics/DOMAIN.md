## Domain filter
Only physics concepts with direct structural isomorphisms to swarm operation or other domains qualify. Physics provides the canonical mathematical form; domain value is as anchor for cross-domain mappings.

## Core isomorphisms

| Physics concept | Swarm / cross-domain parallel | Isomorphism type | Status |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|------------------|--------|
| 2nd Law (entropy increase) | Proxy-K drift; belief staleness without compaction | Degradation gradient | OBSERVED |
| Phase transition (critical point) | URGENT threshold; proxy-K >10% qualitative shift | Threshold-qualitative shift | OBSERVED |
| Principle of least action | Optimization-under-constraint (ISO-1) | Variational minimization | VERIFIED |
| Negative/positive feedback (thermostats) | Homeostasis; compound interest | Stabilizing vs amplifying loops | VERIFIED |
| Emergence (superconductivity, crystals) | Swarm belief coherence from node commits | Macro from micro-rules | OBSERVED |
| Power laws (1/f noise, critical phenomena) | Lesson citation; NK complexity scaling | Scale-free distribution | THEORIZED |
