## Active

- **F-PSY1**: What context-load threshold predicts a drop in swarm execution quality? Design: compare sessions/lanes by coordination-signal density (updates per active lane, average status payload length, context size proxy) against change-quality outcomes and correction latency.

- **F-PSY2**: Which trust-calibration signals improve handoff quality without adding heavy overhead? Design: evaluate lane metadata bundles (`reliability`, `evidence_quality`, `available`, `blocked`, `human_open_item`) and measure merge collision rate, stale-lane dwell time, and correction rate versus baseline.

- **F-PSY3**: How can swarm reduce status-noise while preserving fast pickup and correction? Design: A/B test compact schema-first updates versus verbose free-form updates in `tasks/NEXT.md` and `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`; compare pickup speed, missed-blocker rate, and downstream rework.
