## Domain filter
Only psychology concepts with structural isomorphisms to swarm operation qualify. Isomorphism requires: same decision/cognitive mechanism, same failure modes, and an actionable swarm protocol implication.

## Core isomorphisms

| Psychology concept | Swarm parallel | Isomorphism type | Status |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| Cognitive load | Context overload and parallel-lane status saturation degrade execution quality | Capacity constraint | OBSERVED |
| Attention allocation | Frontier prioritization + lane pickup determine what gets worked now | Selective processing | OBSERVED |
| Trust calibration | Evidence quality and lane history affect handoff confidence | Social inference | THEORIZED |
| Motivation/autonomy | Human low-friction autonomy signals improve swarm continuity | Activation/effort dynamics | OBSERVED |
| Group polarization / cascade bias | Forced sync or weakly independent lanes can amplify shared errors | Collective bias | OBSERVED |
