## Domain filter
Only psychology concepts with structural isomorphisms to swarm operation qualify. Isomorphism requires: same decision/cognitive mechanism, same failure modes, and an actionable swarm protocol implication.

## Core isomorphisms

| Psychology concept | Swarm parallel | Isomorphism type | Status |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| Cognitive load | Context overload and parallel-lane status saturation degrade execution quality | Capacity constraint | OBSERVED |
| Attention allocation | Frontier prioritization + lane pickup determine what gets worked now | Selective processing | OBSERVED |
| Trust calibration | Evidence quality and lane history affect handoff confidence | Social inference | THEORIZED |
| Motivation/autonomy | Human low-friction autonomy signals improve swarm continuity | Activation/effort dynamics | OBSERVED |
| Group polarization / cascade bias | Forced sync or weakly independent lanes can amplify shared errors | Collective bias | OBSERVED |

## Isomorphism vocabulary
ISO-10 (predict-error-revise): cognitive dissonance → prediction error; belief revision = error minimization; schema update = predict-revise loop
ISO-2 (selection → attractor): cognitive bias → selection attractor; confirmation bias narrows evidence intake; attractor = prior belief
ISO-5 (feedback — stabilizing): emotional regulation → stabilizing negative feedback; affect restores to set-point after perturbation
ISO-17 (self-model coherence gap): self-perception → identity fields inflate vs evidence; Dunning-Kruger = ISO-17 instance; illusory superiority
ISO-13 (integral windup): learned helplessness → integral windup of failure experience; accumulated helplessness without discharge = depression
ISO-9 (information bottleneck): attention → information bottleneck; selective attention compresses sensory stream to relevant signal
