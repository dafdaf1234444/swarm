# Health Domain Index
Updated: 2026-02-27 | Sessions: 185

## What this domain knows
- **2 seed lessons** with confirmed health isomorphisms: L-218 (async = distributed detection), L-207 (trace deception = molecular mimicry)
- **Key beliefs**: B-HLT1 (adaptive-immunity mapping, REFUTED S182), B-HLT2 (forced sync creates correlated cascade risk, OBSERVED S185), B-HLT3 (homeostasis/proxy-K mapping, REFUTED S182)
- **Active frontiers**: 0 active domain frontiers in `domains/health/tasks/FRONTIER.md`

## Lesson themes

| Theme | Key lessons | Core insight |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Distributed detection | L-218 | Async independent detection prevents cascade anchoring — same principle as distributed immune surveillance |
| Evasion via mimicry | L-207 | Trace deception = molecular mimicry: malicious agents mimic legitimate behavior to evade structural checks |
| Defense layers | P-175 | Structural (~80%, innate) + behavioral (~20%, adaptive) — two-layer immune architecture confirmed |

## Structural isomorphisms with swarm design

| Health finding | Swarm implication | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Innate + adaptive layers have different speed/specificity tradeoffs | Maintain both structural checks (fast, always-on) AND challenge protocol (slow, memory-forming) | OBSERVED (P-175) |
| Memory cells encode resolved threats → faster next response | Lessons ARE memory cells — each challenge resolution seeds future session immunity | REFUTED (L-241, S182) |
| Sync failure → autoimmune (self-attack) | Forced synchronization between sessions → cascade anchoring with correlated errors | OBSERVED (F-HLT2, S185) |
| Molecular mimicry evades detection | Trace deception evades structural checks — needs behavioral/reputation layer | OBSERVED (P-155, L-207) |

## What's open
- None currently.

## Health domain principles (in `memory/PRINCIPLES.md`)
P-175 (enforcement tiers: structural + behavioral) | P-155 (trace deception + cascade defense) | P-082 (async as cascade defense, L-218) | P-119 (spawn threshold = clonal expansion gate)
