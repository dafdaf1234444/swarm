# Health Domain Index
Updated: 2026-02-27 | Sessions: 180

## What this domain knows
- **2 seed lessons** with confirmed health isomorphisms: L-218 (async = distributed detection), L-207 (trace deception = molecular mimicry)
- **Key beliefs**: B-HLT1 (adaptive immunity → belief evolution, THEORIZED), B-HLT2 (autoimmune → cascade anchoring, THEORIZED), B-HLT3 (homeostasis → proxy-K floor, THEORIZED)
- **Active frontiers**: 3 domain frontiers in `domains/health/tasks/FRONTIER.md`

## Lesson themes

| Theme | Key lessons | Core insight |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Distributed detection | L-218 | Async independent detection prevents cascade anchoring — same principle as distributed immune surveillance |
| Evasion via mimicry | L-207 | Trace deception = molecular mimicry: malicious agents mimic legitimate behavior to evade structural checks |
| Defense layers | P-175 | Structural (~80%, innate) + behavioral (~20%, adaptive) — two-layer immune architecture confirmed |

## Structural isomorphisms with swarm design

| Health finding | Swarm implication | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Innate + adaptive layers have different speed/specificity tradeoffs | Maintain both structural checks (fast, always-on) AND challenge protocol (slow, memory-forming) | OBSERVED (P-175) |
| Memory cells encode resolved threats → faster next response | Lessons ARE memory cells — each challenge resolution seeds future session immunity | THEORIZED |
| Sync failure → autoimmune (self-attack) | Forced synchronization between sessions → cascade anchoring (see L-218) | THEORIZED |
| Molecular mimicry evades detection | Trace deception evades structural checks — needs behavioral/reputation layer | OBSERVED (P-155, L-207) |

## What's open
- **F-HLT1**: Does the adaptive-immunity mapping hold? Test: track lesson "reactivation rate" — how often does a resolved lesson get cited in a later challenge? High reactivation = strong memory-cell parallel.
- **F-HLT2**: Does forced session synchronization increase cascade failure rate (autoimmune analog)? Test: compare F-AI4 async vs sync results for cascade correlation.
- **F-HLT3**: Does proxy-K floor act as homeostatic set point? Test: after compaction sprint, does proxy-K return to floor or drift above?

## Health domain principles (in `memory/PRINCIPLES.md`)
P-175 (enforcement tiers: structural + behavioral) | P-155 (trace deception + cascade defense) | P-082 (async as cascade defense, L-218) | P-119 (spawn threshold = clonal expansion gate)
