## Active

- **F-HLT1**: Does the adaptive-immunity / memory-cell mapping hold for swarm lessons? Adaptive immunity produces memory B and T cells that encode resolved pathogen encounters — future encounters with the same pathogen trigger faster, stronger responses. Swarm prediction: lessons that encode resolved challenges should have HIGHER reactivation rates (cited in future challenges) than lessons that encode positive findings. **Next**: compare citation patterns of "challenge-resolution" lessons (e.g., lessons from CHALLENGES.md resolutions) vs. "discovery" lessons; measure whether challenge-resolution lessons are cited more in subsequent CHALLENGES.md entries.

- **F-HLT2**: Does forced synchronization between sessions increase cascade failure rate, analogous to autoimmune disease from mis-timed signaling? L-218 showed async prevents cascade anchoring. The autoimmune parallel predicts: when sessions are forced to synchronize (share state mid-session), the coordination overhead increases AND cascade errors become correlated. **Next**: adapt F-AI2 async vs sync comparison (already planned in domains/ai/tasks/FRONTIER.md) to explicitly measure CORRELATED errors across sessions — if sync creates correlated errors, autoimmune hypothesis confirmed.

- **F-HLT3**: Does proxy-K (F116) behave as a homeostatic set point after compaction events? Homeostasis: the body returns to a set-point temperature after perturbation (fever or cold). Proxy-K prediction: after a compaction sprint that drops proxy-K below floor, it should drift back toward (but not far above) the floor — a regulated equilibrium rather than unbounded growth. **Next**: extract proxy-K measurements from experiments/proxy-k-log.json over the last 20 sessions; plot trajectory; test whether post-compaction drift follows homeostatic vs. linear growth pattern.
