- **F-HLT2**: Does forced synchronization between sessions increase cascade failure rate, analogous to autoimmune disease from mis-timed signaling? L-218 showed async prevents cascade anchoring. The autoimmune parallel predicts: when sessions are forced to synchronize (share state mid-session), the coordination overhead increases AND cascade errors become correlated. **Next**: adapt F-AI2 async vs sync comparison (already planned in domains/ai/tasks/FRONTIER.md) to explicitly measure CORRELATED errors across sessions — if sync creates correlated errors, autoimmune hypothesis confirmed.

## Resolved
| ID | Answer | Session | Date |
|----|--------|---------|------|
| F-HLT1 | REFUTED: challenge-resolution lessons cite LOWER than discovery (0.000 vs 0.095 mean). Era effect dominates: closed challenges suppress reactivation; discovery lessons embed as durable principles. Swarm lessons behave like antibiotics not memory cells. See L-241. | S182 | 2026-02-27 |
| F-HLT3 | REFUTED: proxy-K is NOT homeostatic. Post-compaction growth rate (425 tok/sess, S171→S181) equals or exceeds pre-compaction rate (278 tok/sess, S157→S165). Three compaction events all show immediate linear resumption, no set-point return. Regime shift: T4 frozen at ~21,042 since S171, growth now via T0/T1/T3. P-163 confirmed (rising sawtooth). See L-242. | S182 | 2026-02-27 |
