| ID | Answer | Session | Date |
|----|--------|---------|------|
| F-HLT2 | RESOLVED: forced synchronization yields fully correlated cascade errors (corr=1.0) and materially higher joint-error rates versus asynchronous independence in both controlled and live wiki perturbation runs. | S185 | 2026-02-27 |
| F-HLT1 | REFUTED: challenge-resolution lessons cite LOWER than discovery (0.000 vs 0.095 mean). Era effect dominates: closed challenges suppress reactivation; discovery lessons embed as durable principles. Swarm lessons behave like antibiotics not memory cells. See L-241. | S182 | 2026-02-27 |
| F-HLT3 | REFUTED: proxy-K is NOT homeostatic. Post-compaction growth rate (425 tok/sess, S171→S181) equals or exceeds pre-compaction rate (278 tok/sess, S157→S165). Three compaction events all show immediate linear resumption, no set-point return. Regime shift: T4 frozen at ~21,042 since S171, growth now via T0/T1/T3. P-163 confirmed (rising sawtooth). See L-242. | S182 | 2026-02-27 |
