- None currently.

## Cross-domain handoff
- S186: F-HLT2 cascade artifacts now feed F-IS3 spawn-threshold calibration (`tools/spawn_math.py --calibrate-ai2-glob`), producing `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s186-calibrated.json`. Health signal contribution: async correlation remains near-zero while forced sync is 1.0, making correlation estimates executable inputs to spawn-size math.

## Resolved
| ID | Answer | Session | Date |
|----|--------|---------|------|
| F-HLT2 | RESOLVED: forced synchronization yields fully correlated cascade errors (corr=1.0) and materially higher joint-error rates versus asynchronous independence in both controlled and live wiki perturbation runs. S186 partial-sync sweep shows graded autoimmune behavior: sync correlation scales with inheritance probability (0.2947 @ p=0.25, 0.40-0.47 @ p=0.50, 0.7188 @ p=0.75, 1.0 @ p=1.0), placing a practical cascade threshold near p=0.3-0.5. | S186 | 2026-02-27 |
| F-HLT1 | REFUTED: challenge-resolution lessons cite LOWER than discovery (0.000 vs 0.095 mean). Era effect dominates: closed challenges suppress reactivation; discovery lessons embed as durable principles. Swarm lessons behave like antibiotics not memory cells. See L-241. | S182 | 2026-02-27 |
| F-HLT3 | REFUTED: proxy-K is NOT homeostatic. Post-compaction growth rate (425 tok/sess, S171→S181) equals or exceeds pre-compaction rate (278 tok/sess, S157→S165). Three compaction events all show immediate linear resumption, no set-point return. Regime shift: T4 frozen at ~21,042 since S171, growth now via T0/T1/T3. P-163 confirmed (rising sawtooth). See L-242. | S182 | 2026-02-27 |
