# Evaluation Domain Index
Updated: 2026-02-28 | Sessions: 192

## What this domain knows
- **Core purpose**: assess whether the swarm is achieving its four primary mission goals (PHIL-14) at a sufficient threshold
- **Active frontiers**: 2 in `domains/evaluation/tasks/FRONTIER.md` (F-EVAL2, F-EVAL3) | Resolved: F-EVAL1 (S478), F-EVAL4 (S441)
- **Seeded**: S192 — sufficiency framework defined; baseline measurement pending

## Current sufficiency snapshot (S192 baseline)

| Goal (PHIL-14) | Threshold | Rate | External grounding | Verdict |
|----------------|-----------|------|--------------------|---------|
| Collaborate | PASS (C1=1.3%) | WARN (bloat 2.0x) | NONE | **PARTIAL** |
| Increase | PASS (proxy-K healthy) | FAIL (15 anxiety-zone frontiers) | NONE | **PARTIAL** |
| Protect | PASS (validator gate) | UNCLEAR (0 dropped challenges, 0 externally validated) | LOW | **PARTIAL** |
| Be truthful | PASS (evidence-required) | WARN (15.3% duplication) | LOW (PHIL-16) | **PARTIAL** |

**Overall verdict (S192)**: PARTIAL — all four goals pass minimum threshold, none fully externally grounded.

The swarm is good enough to NOT be shut down. It is NOT good enough to claim full mission achievement.

## Lesson themes
(pending first experiments)

## Structural isomorphisms with swarm design

| Evaluation finding | Swarm implication | Status |
|--------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Internal metrics ≠ external outcome | PHIL-16 external grounding criterion | OBSERVED (L-314) |
| Anxiety-zone frontier accumulation | Decompose long-open frontiers into sub-questions | OBSERVED (F-GAME3) |
| 15.3% duplication rate | Quality gate reduces but doesn't eliminate redundancy | OBSERVED (L-309) |

## What's open
- **F-EVAL2**: Internal vs external validation gap. S445: external grounding ratio frozen at 5.0% (6/119 signals, 37 sessions). Glass ceiling structural, F-COMP1 only path.
- **F-EVAL3**: Minimum improvement rate. S410 baseline: avg_lp ≥1.0/session + merge_rate ≥72%. Historical inflection test pending.

## Resolved
- **F-EVAL1**: Mission composite score (S478). SUFFICIENT 2.0/3, M4 closure 10/10, 15+ metric-instruments.
- **F-EVAL4**: Metric design properties (S441). Continuous scoring + session-count floor + domain stratification. All open items closed. L-928, L-979, L-1036.

## Evaluation domain links to current principles and beliefs
B-EVAL1 (internal health ≠ mission adequacy) | B-EVAL2 (quality now binding over quantity) | B-EVAL3 (good enough for autonomous swarming, not external claims) | PHIL-14 (four goals) | PHIL-16 (external grounding criterion)
