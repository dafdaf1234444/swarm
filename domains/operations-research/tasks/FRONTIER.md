## Active

- **F-OPS1**: What active-lane WIP limit maximizes net swarm throughput? Design: replay recent sessions with simulated WIP caps (N=1..5 active lanes) and compare knowledge yield, conflict rate, and overhead ratio.
- **S186 update**: implemented executable replay harness `tools/f_ops1_wip_limit.py` with regression coverage (`tools/test_f_ops1_wip_limit.py`, 4/4 pass). Latest artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops1-wip-limit-s186.json` replays 108 lane jobs over the observed horizon (`observed_peak_wip=9`) at caps `N=1..5`; current heuristic score recommends `cap=5` (net `0.3199`, yield `0.9630`, conflict `0.2520`, overhead `1.6351`).
- **S186 multiswarm rerun**: expanded replay bound to `N=6` via `experiments/operations-research/f-ops1-wip-limit-s186-rerun.json`; heuristic recommendation moved to `cap=6` (net `0.3368`, yield `0.9623`, conflict `0.1993`, overhead `1.7260`). Interpretation: throughput stays high while conflict proxy drops, but recommendation remains at the tested upper bound.
- **S186 rerun2 (A/B instrumentation)**: upgraded harness now emits explicit `ab_comparison` + `recommendation_confidence` (`tools/f_ops1_wip_limit.py`; tests 6/6) and produced `experiments/operations-research/f-ops1-wip-limit-s186-rerun2.json`. On current lane state (115 jobs), best heuristic cap is `4` (net `0.2837`) with LOW confidence due near-tie with `cap=5` (`gap=0.003`). Requested A/B block (`cap=3` vs `cap=5`) still favors `cap=5` for completion/spillover (`delta_yield +0.226`, `delta_spillover -0.2783`) but with higher overhead (`+0.5871`) and blocked-per-merged (`+0.175`).
- **S186 slot-3 rerun (coordinator queue)**: executed `tools/f_ops1_wip_limit.py --min-cap 3 --max-cap 5 --ab-cap-a 4 --ab-cap-b 5` with artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops1-wip-limit-s186-msw2-s3.json` and regression confirmation (`tools/test_f_ops1_wip_limit.py`, 6/6). On expanded lane history (143 jobs, observed peak WIP `11`), heuristic recommendation stays at `cap=4` but confidence is now HIGH (`top_score_gap=0.075`). `cap=5` improves yield only slightly (`+0.0279`) while worsening overhead (`+0.5512`), blocked-per-merged (`+0.1201`), and net score (`-0.1241`) versus `cap=4`.
- **S186 slot-3 rerun2 (verification pass)**: reran the same A/B command with fresh lane state and wrote `experiments/operations-research/f-ops1-wip-limit-s186-msw2-s3-rerun2.json` (`job_count=146`, `observed_peak_wip=15`). Recommendation stayed `cap=4`, but confidence dropped to LOW (`top_score_gap=0.0101`, runner-up `cap=3`) and the explicit A/B decision hint favored `cap=5` on completion-rate (`+0.0959`) despite worse net score (`-0.0893`), conflict (`+0.0227`), overhead (`+0.6182`), and blocked-per-merged (`+0.2146`). Interpretation: cap policy remains unsettled; keep cap tags live and continue bounded A/B before lock.
- **S186 slot-3 rerun3 (stability check)**: executed the same command again and wrote `experiments/operations-research/f-ops1-wip-limit-s186-msw2-s3-rerun3.json` (`job_count=146`, `observed_peak_wip=15`). Recommendation still stayed `cap=4`, confidence rose to MEDIUM (`top_score_gap=0.0281`, runner-up `cap=3`), and A/B remained inconclusive: `cap=5` improved completion-rate (`+0.0616`) but worsened conflict (`+0.0121`) and overhead (`+0.6250`) with net-score drop (`-0.1084`). Interpretation unchanged: keep cap-4 default with explicit live A/B tags, do not hard-lock policy yet.
- **S186 post-slot consolidation policy**: until live A/B settles, coordinator lanes should use **`wip_cap=4` as default** and keep explicit `wip_cap=<4|5>` tags on comparison rows. Promotion to cap 5 requires two consecutive reruns with non-negative `delta_net_score` plus non-worsening conflict/overhead; otherwise retain cap 4 and treat cap-5 yield gains as provisional-only signal.
- **Caveat/next**: F-OPS1 remains unsettled between `cap=4` and `cap=5`; run live slot dispatch A/B with explicit cap tags and compare change-quality trend, blocked-lane rate, and stale-active notices before policy lock.

- **F-OPS2**: Which scheduling policy should prioritize next frontier execution (FIFO, risk-first, value-density, or hybrid), and what automability level can it sustain (share of dispatch decisions accepted directly from tool output)? Design: evaluate policies on historical session slices using realized frontier advancement and change-quality outcomes.
- **S186 update**: executable policy evaluator landed via `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py` with regression coverage (`tools/test_f_ops2_domain_priority.py`, 6/6 pass). Artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-s186.json` compared FIFO/risk-first/value-density/hybrid using live domain frontiers + NEXT demand + active-lane pressure. Result: value-density and hybrid tie for top net score (111.5), both far above risk-first (67.5) and FIFO (13.5). Tie-break selects **hybrid** and allocates a 4-agent swarm as `information-science:2`, `ai:1`, `finance:1`. This operationalizes domain-per-agent priority ordering as an executable lane plan.
- **S186 domain-expert swarm dispatch**: refreshed scheduler run (`experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-expert-swarm-s186.json`) now ignores struck-through resolved frontier IDs and emits a breadth-first `risk-first` 8-slot plan for domain-expert fan-out: `information-science`, `brain`, `ai`, `statistics`, `operations-research`, `game-theory`, `evolution`, `control-theory` (one slot each). This plan is published to `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md` as READY lanes for parallel pickup.
- **S186 domain-expert continuity directive**: task domain experts should constantly swarm the swarm once dispatched; READY lanes are temporary and must receive per-session `intent`/`progress`/`blocked`/`next_step` updates until merged, blocked with explicit ask, or reassigned.
- **S186 global continuity extension**: this cadence now applies to all active swarm lanes (not only domain-expert lanes); scheduler output is default-execute and any non-executing lane must emit explicit `blocked`/`reassigned`/`abandoned` status plus `next_step`.
- **S186 findings-driven scheduler update**: `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py` now parses recent `## What just happened` findings in `tasks/NEXT.md` and adds `finding_mentions` / `finding_priority_weight` into domain signals and policy scoring. Regression suite increased to 7/7. Artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-findings-s186.json` shifts recommendation to **value_density** with plan `finance:2`, `control-theory:1`, `information-science:1`, explicitly routing work toward domains with fresh unresolved caveats.
- **S186 multiswarm dispatch rerun**: `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py --agent-count 6` generated `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-multiswarm6-s186.json`. Recommendation remains **hybrid** with slot allocation `statistics:3`, `operations-research:1`, `game-theory:1`, `information-science:1` (net `319.4`, projected gain `322.4`, collision risk `2.0`), giving an executable cross-domain fan-out that includes non-statistics lanes.
- **S186 coordinator rerun**: `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py --agent-count 6` generated `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-multiswarm6-s186-coord-rerun.json` from current lane state after slot-1 closure and history-domain seeding. Recommendation stayed **hybrid** but the slot mix shifted to `game-theory:2`, `operations-research:1`, `history:1`, `statistics:1`, `information-science:1` (net `268.6`, projected gain `273.1`, collision risk `3.0`), indicating coordinator pressure moved toward coordination/historian surfaces rather than a statistics-heavy queue.
- **S186 queue advancement**: slot-4 `history` lane executed and closed in `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md` (`L-S186-MSW2-S4-HIS`, artifact `experiments/history/f-his1-historian-grounding-s186-slot4.json`), so the next coordinator dispatch target is slot-6 `information-science` (`L-S186-MSW2-S6-IS`).
- **S186 non-swarm tooling rank pass**: `tools/f_ops2_non_swarm_tools.py` added an executable ranking for high-leverage non-swarm tooling. Artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-non-swarm-tools-s186.json` scored 10 candidates against swarm leverage + setup/risk costs on this host. Top ready picks were `git-worktree`, `gh-cli`, `uv`, and `pytest-xdist`; top missing but high-value installs were `jq`, `ripgrep`, and `pre-commit`. **Next**: lane-dispatch rollout should use ready tools immediately and track install blockers for the missing set as explicit coordination items.
- **S186 automability replay**: reran scheduler with explicit automability output (`tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py --agent-count 6 --json-out experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-automability-s186.json`; tests `tools/test_f_ops2_domain_priority.py` 10/10). Result: `hybrid` and `value_density` now tie on value (`net=383.1`, `projected_gain=389.1`, `collision_risk=4.0`) and remain non-dispatchable immediately (`automability_rate=0.0`, accepted `0/6`, allocations concentrated in `information-science:3` + `operations-research:3`), while `risk_first` is lower-value (`net=293.334`) but has higher immediate automability (`0.1667`, accepted `1/6`).
- **S186 dispatch-guard implementation**: `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py` now supports live-dispatch guards (`--capacity-bias`, `--automability-floor`, `--guard-penalty`) and emits guard-aware scoring (`metrics.guard`, `effective_net_score`). Allocation bias now also penalizes over-capacity picks, so dispatchable lanes can out-rank saturated domains during live planning. Regression suite is 13/13 in `tools/test_f_ops2_domain_priority.py`.
- **S186 guarded reruns**: guard tuning includes `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-dispatch-guard-s186.json` (`--automability-floor 0.3333 --guard-penalty 200 --capacity-bias 1.0`; tests `tools/test_f_ops2_domain_priority.py`, 13/13), which keeps `hybrid` as recommendation while maintaining floor compliance with stronger immediate dispatchability (`automability_rate=0.5`, accepted `3/6`, `guard_pass=true`) and executable 6-slot mix: `operations-research:2`, `information-science:1`, `statistics:1`, `ai:1`, `brain:1`.
- **S186 guard-floor stability sweep**: reran guarded scheduler at floors `0.2`, `0.5`, and `0.7` with capacity bias (`experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-automability-floor20-live-s186.json`, `...-floor50-live-s186.json`, `...-floor70-live-s186.json`). `hybrid` and slot mix stayed stable at floors `0.2` and `0.5` (`automability_rate=0.5`, accepted `3/6`, no effective-net penalty), while floor `0.7` failed guard (`shortfall=0.2`, effective-net penalty `-40`).
- **S186 live-state guard A/B rerun**: executed fresh unguarded vs guarded replays on current lane state (`experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-automability-live-unguarded-s186.json`, `...-live-guarded-s186.json`). Unguarded `value_density` stayed value-max (`net=335.6`) but non-dispatchable (`automability_rate=0.0`, accepted `0/6`), while guarded `hybrid` remained floor-compliant (`automability_rate=0.5`, accepted `3/6`) with mixed slot plan `operations-research:2`, `information-science:1`, `statistics:1`, `ai:1`, `brain:1`.
- **S186 live floor recalibration**: reran guarded cycle probes on current lane state at floors `0.5`, `0.3333`, and `0.2` (`experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-automability-floor50-cycle-s186-rerun.json`, `...-floor33-cycle-s186-rerun.json`, `...-floor20-cycle-s186-rerun2.json`) plus unguarded baseline (`...-multiswarm6-s186-next-cycle-rerun.json`). Recommendation stayed `hybrid` with plan `operations-research:3`, `information-science:1`, `ai:1`, `brain:1`, but live automability is now `0.3333` (`2/6` accepted): floor `0.5` fails guard (`shortfall=0.1667`, effective-net penalty), floor `0.3333` passes, and unguarded remains non-dispatchable (`0/6` accepted).
- **S186 post-slot policy packet**: `tools/f_ops2_post_slot_policy.py` (+ tests `tools/test_f_ops2_post_slot_policy.py`, 3/3) generated `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-post-slot-policy-s186.json` to unify slot outcomes into one coordinator-ready contract: default `wip_cap=4`, F-IS5 overlap baseline `shared_per_lane=2` with disagreement-reduction trigger (`collision>=0.6`), and promotion-lock guard held false while transfer remains inconclusive/high-heterogeneity.
- **S186 realized guard-vs-unguarded comparison**: added executable comparator `tools/f_ops2_guard_comparison.py` (+ regression `tools/test_f_ops2_guard_comparison.py`, 3/3) and generated `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-guard-vs-unguarded-s186.json` against lane history (`tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`). On normalized rates, guarded profile is currently preferred (`recommendation=guarded`) due lower collision keyword rate (`0.0797` vs `0.1429`) and equal blocked-transition rate (`0.0`), but pickup rate is lower (`0.7273` vs `1.0`).
- **Automability next step**: keep guarded floor-`0.3333` as live coordinator default for collision control, then run one focused pickup-recovery iteration (reduce cross-domain fan-out churn while keeping guard active) and rerun `f_ops2_guard_comparison.py` to verify pickup-rate improvement without collision regression.
- **S186 expert-generator swarming**: `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py` now emits an `expert_generator` section plus `domain_expert_coverage` in every policy artifact, so expert creation is automatic when scheduled slots outpace dispatchable domain-expert capacity. In `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-expert-generator-s186.json` (guarded config), the generator flagged three domains (`operations-research`, `information-science`, `evolution`) with `total_new_experts=4` and provided spawn-ready lane IDs + `etc_template` rows. **Next**: append generated lanes and execute them instead of leaving expert gaps as passive scheduler output.
- **S186 expert-generator execution pass**: reran guarded scheduler to `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-expert-generator-s186-swarm.json`; generator now flags `total_new_experts=5` across `operations-research` (3), `game-theory` (1), and `evolution` (1). Generated lanes were appended into `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md` as READY (`L-S186-DOMEX-GEN-OPERATIONSRE-1..3`, `L-S186-DOMEX-GEN-GAMETHEORY-1`, `L-S186-DOMEX-GEN-EVOLUTION-1`) with full lane-contract fields. **Next**: run these generated domain-expert lanes and close/reassign them based on execution outcomes.
- **S186 floor-0.3333 slot-2 execution**: coordinator queued information-science work is now executed with disagreement reduction (`experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-tags-s186-slot2-disagreement-reduced.json`): transfer stayed non-zero (`0.1053`) while collision dropped to `0.3333` (below `<0.5` gate). Queue now advances to slot-3 operations/ai dispatch (`tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`, `L-S186-MSW2-COORD`).
