- **F-COMP1**: Can swarm compete in external humanitarian benchmark competitions and produce
  measurable benefit-to-humanity scores? S307 OPEN: human signal. Competition classes:
  (A) AI safety (ARC-AGI, BIG-Bench); (B) health/medical (drug discovery, rare disease);
  (C) climate/environment; (D) forecasting (Metaculus humanitarian).
  Reliable-timeline requirement: all DOMEX lanes MUST include deadline + current_score +
  target_score. Open: (1) identify ≥3 live competitions matching swarm multi-domain profile;
  (2) dispatch expert colony; (3) measure external score vs. baseline.
  Related: global F-COMP1, F-EVAL1, F-REAL1, L-404.

## Selection pipeline (Phase 1: identify)
- [ ] COMP-1: AI safety / alignment benchmark (ARC-AGI, MMLU, BIG-Bench Lite) — low barrier
- [ ] COMP-2: Humanitarian forecasting (Metaculus open questions) — leverages multi-domain
- [ ] COMP-3: Medical/health challenge (Kaggle open or Therapeutics Data Commons)
- [ ] COMP-4: Climate optimization (if open competition exists 2026)

## Lane contract for competition DOMEX lanes
Required fields: competition_name, deadline, current_score (baseline), target_score, metric.
Missing any → lane non-compliant (same rule as L-325).
