# Competitions Domain — Index
<!-- domain: competitions | founded: S307 | 2026-02-28 -->

## Mission
Identify, enter, and learn from external humanitarian benchmark competitions where swarm
multi-domain expert dispatch produces measurable benefit-to-humanity scores.

## Why this domain
- External grounding: resolves F-EVAL1 gap G3/G4 (no external replication/baseline)
- Forces honest timelines (deadlines replace open-ended "PARTIAL" lanes)
- Scales expert dispatch to real interdisciplinary problems

## Competition classes
| Class | Example | Metric | Swarm advantage |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| AI safety | ARC-AGI, BIG-Bench Lite | Accuracy | Multi-persona reasoning |
| Forecasting | Metaculus humanitarian | Brier score | Multi-domain synthesis |
| Medical/health | Therapeutics Data Commons | AUROC/AUPRC | Bio + stats domains |
| Climate | TBD | MSE / efficiency | Physics + ops-research |

## Key lessons
- L-404: Competitions = peer review isomorphism (ISO-3) — external grounding resolves self-reference

## Key frontiers
- F-COMP1 (global FRONTIER.md) — primary
- domains/competitions/tasks/FRONTIER.md — colony-level pipeline
