## Active

- **F-STAT1**: What minimum sample size and effect-size threshold should domain experiments meet before a swarm claim is promoted? **S186 replay calibration**: added `tools/f_stat1_promotion_gates.py` with regression coverage (`tools/test_f_stat1_promotion_gates.py`, 3/3) and generated `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-promotion-gates-s186.json` from recent domain artifacts (73 considered, 39 usable). Replay-derived promotion gates: simulation (`n>=80`, `|effect|>=0.2442`), live-query (`n>=300`, `|effect|>=0.05`), lane-log extraction (`n>=28`, `|effect|>=0.2195`). Caveat: live-query effect floor is low and power-model `n_for_80pct=1565`, so current `n=300` gate is explicitly a practical cap (estimated power `0.2315`) pending higher-sample reruns and regime split (resolver-proxy vs direct-answer).
- **S186 first calibration**: `tools/f_stat1_experiment_gates.py` generated `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-experiment-gates-s186.json` from current FIN1/IS5/CTL1 artifact families. Current class gates from the refreshed S186 artifact: **live_query** (`min_runs=15`, `min_per_run_sample=8`, `min_abs_effect=0.0477`, CI crosses zero), **lane_log_extraction** (`min_runs=8`, `min_per_run_sample=28`, `min_abs_effect=0.1241`, instability driven by tag-vs-non-tag divergence), **simulation_control** (`min_runs=4`, `min_per_run_sample=43`, `min_abs_effect=0.0389`, positive CI). **Next**: validate these gates on post-S186 runs and split FIN1 by scoring mode (resolver proxy vs direct-answer) to avoid mixed-regime pooling.
- **S186 power-replay follow-up**: `tools/f_stat1_promotion_gates.py` regenerated `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-promotion-gates-s186.json` on broad artifact globs (39 usable / 73 considered). Current class promotion gates: **simulation** (`recommended_min_sample_size=80`, `recommended_min_effect_size=0.2442`, `estimated_power_at_recommended_n=0.8707`), **live_query** (`recommended_min_sample_size=300`, `recommended_min_effect_size=0.05`, `practical_cap_n=300`, `power_model_n_for_80pct=1565`, `estimated_power_at_recommended_n=0.2315`), **lane_log_extraction** (`recommended_min_sample_size=28`, `recommended_min_effect_size=0.2195`, medium confidence). **Caveat**: live-query pooling spans heterogeneous AI + FIN modes and remains underpowered at the practical-cap minimum; split the class and rerun before policy hard-lock.
- **S186 reporting-quality hardening rerun**: `tools/f_stat1_reporting_quality.py` now emits inferred + explicit contract metrics with active-lane parity. Refreshed artifact `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-reporting-quality-s186.json` reports full saturation on current active lanes (`active_lanes=5`, inferred/explicit `mean_score=1.0`, inferred/explicit `contract_ready_rate=1.0`, `programmatic_swarmable_rate=1.0`). **Policy update**: explicit score remains the promotion gate; inferred score stays diagnostic.
- **S186 reporting-quality handoff-window A/B**: `pickup_latency_ab` now includes `handoff_window_ab`, measuring READY/CLAIMED rows to first same-lane ACTIVE/BLOCKED/MERGED touch so utilization can be measured beyond immediate same-session updates. Current snapshot: same-lane next-update parity remains (`schema_contract.count=11`, `free_form.count=18`, mean delta `0.0`), but handoff windows expose unresolved queue mass in recent schema rows (`schema eligible=15`, `pickup_rate=0.0`, unresolved `15`) versus historical free-form (`eligible=16`, `pickup_rate=0.4375`, unresolved `9`). **Next**: rerun on matured sessions (exclude same-session censoring) so schema vs free-form handoff speed is comparable.
- **S186 multiswarm reporting snapshot**: cross-domain rerun artifact `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-reporting-quality-s186-multiswarm.json` re-checked active lanes after multiswarm dispatch prep and preserved full explicit readiness (`explicit_mean_score=1.0`, `explicit_contract_ready_rate=1.0`, dispatchable `5/5`). This confirms the coordination contract stayed intact while expanding non-statistics domain runs.
- **S186 consolidated replay follow-up**: `tools/f_stat1_gates.py` generated `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-gates-s186.json` from a broader 27-row cross-domain evidence set (FIN1/AI/CTL/IS5/EVO2). Conservative class gates: **live_query** (`n>=300`, `|effect|>=0.1733`, HIGH), **simulation_replay** (`n>=43`, `|effect|>=0.1242`, LOW fallback), **lane_log_extraction** (`n>=34`, `|effect|>=0.4583`, MEDIUM). **Next**: reconcile this conservative replay with the two earlier S186 calibrations into one canonical promotion policy.
- **S186 canonical reconciliation (slot-1 execution)**: `tools/f_stat1_canonical_policy.py` + tests (`tools/test_f_stat1_canonical_policy.py`) now reconcile `f-stat1-experiment-gates`, `f-stat1-promotion-gates`, and `f-stat1-gates` into one executable policy artifact: `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-canonical-policy-s186.json`. Canonical strict gates are `live_query` (`min_runs=15`, `n>=300`, `|effect|>=0.1733`), `simulation` (`min_runs=4`, `n>=80`, `|effect|>=0.2442`), and `lane_log_extraction` (`min_runs=8`, `n>=34`, `|effect|>=0.4583`). **Result**: all classes are still `PROVISIONAL` due threshold dispersion; live-query also remains underpowered at practical cap (`estimated_power=0.2315`, `n_for_80pct=1565`) and mixed-regime risk. **Next**: split live-query regimes and add independent replications to reduce class-threshold spread before policy lock.
- **S186 post-slot consolidation policy**: `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-canonical-policy-s186.json` is now the authoritative promotion gate source. Promotion remains `PROVISIONAL` unless class runs satisfy canonical `min_runs`, `min_sample_size`, and `min_abs_effect`; for multiplicity-driven candidates, keep provisional when family heterogeneity is high (`I2>=70`) even if corrected discoveries are present.
- **S186 cross-domain policy packet**: `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-post-slot-policy-s186.json` now codifies the statistics lock condition in coordinator terms: keep promotion lock off while any class remains `PROVISIONAL`, transfer decision is inconclusive, or heterogeneity guards fail (`overall I2>=50` or family `I2>=70`).

- **F-STAT2**: Can we pool evidence across domain swarms into stable transfer estimates? **S186 first random-effects pass**: `tools/f_stat2_meta_analysis.py` generated `experiments/statistics/f-stat2-meta-analysis-s186.json` across 21 studies from FIN1/IS5/CTL1 families. Overall pooled effect is near zero (`+0.0013`, CI95 `[-0.0401, +0.0428]`, `I2=29.1%`) with transfer decision `inconclusive`; family splits show control-threshold positive-but-wide, finance near-zero, and IS5 negative-leaning/high-heterogeneity (`I2=76.9%`).
- **S186 slot-5 regime-split rerun**: updated `tools/f_stat2_meta_analysis.py` to split FIN1 regimes (`finance_factual_qa_direct_answer` vs `finance_factual_qa_resolver_proxy`) and generated `experiments/statistics/f-stat2-meta-analysis-s186-rerun.json` over 26 studies. Overall remains inconclusive (`pooled_effect=-0.0162`, CI95 `[-0.0599, +0.0275]`, `I2=49.5%`); finance regimes remain near zero (`direct=-0.0048`, `resolver_proxy=+0.0015`, delta `-0.0063`), while `information_science_lane_distill` remains the dominant heterogeneous family (`I2=83.4%`, pooled effect `-0.1814`, CI touches zero). **Next**: collect independent IS5 replications (especially non-tagged/overlap-balanced slices) to reduce family heterogeneity before transfer-policy use.

- **F-STAT3**: How should swarm control false discoveries when running many frontiers in parallel? **S186 first multiplicity pass**: `tools/f_stat3_multiplicity.py` generated `experiments/statistics/f-stat3-multiplicity-s186.json` from the F-STAT2 pooled study set (21 studies). Discovery counts were low and non-promotable (`bh_discoveries=1`, `bonferroni_discoveries=1`, `promotion_candidates=[]`), with only one family (`information_science_lane_distill`) showing a corrected discovery but failing replication gate (`replication_count=1`, `min_replications_for_promotion=2`).
- **S186 slot-5 replay rerun**: reran multiplicity on the regime-split meta artifact (`experiments/statistics/f-stat2-meta-analysis-s186-rerun.json`) and produced `experiments/statistics/f-stat3-multiplicity-s186-rerun.json` (`study_count=26`). Corrected discoveries rose (`bh=2`, `bonferroni=2`) and one family became promotion-eligible (`promotion_candidates=[information_science_lane_distill]`, `replication_count=3`). **Caveat**: this family remains high-heterogeneity with negative weighted mean (`-0.0553`) and mixed intervention regimes, so promotion should stay provisional pending targeted replication that isolates overlap/tag policy effects.
- **S186 domain-integrity rerun**: executed `tools/f_stat3_multiplicity.py --meta experiments/statistics/f-stat2-meta-analysis-domain-integrity-s186.json` and generated `experiments/statistics/f-stat3-multiplicity-domain-integrity-s186.json` (`study_count=29`). Corrected discoveries increased (`bh=3`, `bonferroni=3`) with one promotion candidate still concentrated in `information_science_lane_distill` (`replication_count=5`, weighted mean `-0.0489`). **Caveat/next**: despite higher replication count, candidate direction remains negative and transfer pooling in the paired F-STAT2 artifact is still inconclusive; keep promotion provisional until IS5 overlap/tag regimes are isolated and heterogeneity drops.
- **S186 multiswarm slot replay closure**: executed lane `L-S186-MSW-S3-STAT` via `tools/f_stat3_multiplicity.py --meta experiments/statistics/f-stat2-meta-analysis-s186-rerun.json --out experiments/statistics/f-stat3-multiplicity-s186-msw-s3-rerun.json` with regression confirmation (`tools/test_f_stat3_multiplicity.py`, 3/3). Result stayed stable on the regime-split meta set (`study_count=26`, `bh=2`, `bonferroni=2`, candidate family=`information_science_lane_distill`), so promotion remains provisional under the existing heterogeneity guard.
