- **F-AI1**: Does information-surfacing intervention (forced pre-reasoning evidence sharing) close the MAS coordination gap? L-220 established info asymmetry as root cause (50pp gap vs single-agent). **S186 controlled pass + rerun** (`tools/f_ai1_evidence_surfacing.py`, 3000 then 2000 trials): first pass showed async follower error `0.356`, sync-copy `0.354`, evidence-surfacing `0.286` (delta `-0.070` vs async); rerun (`experiments/ai/f-ai1-evidence-surfacing-s186-rerun.json`) remained directional with async `0.349`, sync-copy `0.355`, evidence-surfacing `0.280` (delta `-0.070`). Correlation profile remains ordered (async near 0, surfacing mid, sync 1.0). This supports the claim that selective evidence sharing improves accuracy without full synchronization coupling. **S186 live integration pass** (`tools/wiki_swarm.py --ai1-live-experiment`, 200 trials) produced `experiments/ai/f-ai1-live-evidence-surfacing-s186.json`: async follower error `0.315`, sync `0.305`, evidence-surfacing `0.215` (delta `-0.100` vs async), with correlation still below full sync (`0.3935` vs `1.0`). **S186 independent live rerun** (`tools/f_ai1_evidence_surfacing.py --live`, 160 trials) produced `experiments/ai/f-ai1-live-evidence-s186.json`: async `0.275`, sync `0.3063`, evidence-surfacing `0.0813` (delta `-0.1938`), correlation `0.4476` vs sync `1.0`. Caveat: this live harness currently treats "query not perturbed" as confidence, so this should be interpreted as an optimistic upper bound until replaced with a non-oracle confidence signal. **Next**: replace confidence proxy with a query/title-derived score, then replicate across languages/topics and test partial-sync + evidence-surfacing hybrids to estimate where coupling starts to dominate.
- **S186 non-oracle confidence pass**: replaced the live confidence proxy in `tools/f_ai1_evidence_surfacing.py` with query-title alignment scoring (`SequenceMatcher` + token overlap; threshold arg `--confidence-threshold`) and validated tests (`tools/test_f_ai1_evidence_surfacing.py`, 4/4). New replications: EN `experiments/ai/f-ai1-live-evidence-s186-nonoracle-en.json` keeps directional gain but smaller (`async 0.275 -> surfacing 0.2313`, delta `-0.0438`, sync `0.3125`), while ES `experiments/ai/f-ai1-live-evidence-s186-nonoracle-es.json` regresses (`async 0.2437 -> surfacing 0.3250`, delta `+0.0813`, sync `0.3000`). Interpretation: non-oracle confidence removes optimistic bias and reveals language-sensitive confidence calibration risk.
- **S186 threshold calibration (slot-4)**: added `--calibrate-thresholds` mode to `tools/f_ai1_evidence_surfacing.py` and ran 6-point threshold sweep (0.20/0.35/0.45/0.58/0.70/0.85) for EN and ES at 60 trials each (`experiments/ai/f-ai1-calibration-s186-en.json`, `experiments/ai/f-ai1-calibration-s186-es.json`). **EN optimal threshold: 0.45** (surfacing_error `0.2167`, delta `-0.1667` vs `-0.1000` at default `0.58`; 6.7pp improvement). **ES regression NOT resolved at any threshold**: best ES threshold is `0.20` (delta `+0.0167`) but surfacing still underperforms async at all 6 thresholds. Root cause of ES failure: `_tokenize` strips accents and Spanish titles differ morphologically from queries, so token overlap scores are structurally lower — the proxy is language-biased, not just miscalibrated. **Interpretation**: EN surfacing can be improved by lowering the threshold to 0.45. ES requires language-aware confidence features (e.g., accent-normalized overlap, Spanish morphological stemming, or cross-lingual embedding similarity) before surfacing becomes safe to deploy globally. **S188 language-aware proxy (gating)**: built recall/F1/stop-word confidence proxy variants — all ES replications regressed (+0.10 to +0.14 delta; consistent with S186 threshold sweep). Root: proxy measures lexical alignment, not correctness. Gated non-EN surfacing (return 0.0 for lang!=en): EN improvement preserved, ES regression eliminated. **PARTIAL CLOSE**: EN surfacing works (delta -0.04 to -0.19 across live replications); non-EN surfacing gated pending cross-lingual embedding or native confidence signal.

- **F-AI3**: Does expect-act-diff tracking measurably reduce belief drift over a 10-session window? F123's core empirical claim. **Baseline established (S182, L-243)**: Pre-S178 (S162–S177, N=16): challenge rate 6.3% (1/16 sessions); zero "Expect next:" entries. Post-S178 (S178–S181, N=4): challenge rate 50% (2/4), all sessions had "Expect next:". Raw jump is large but N=4 is below threshold; confounds include audit-driven corrections (F-FIN3 sweep) and naming collision. Key structural finding: CHALLENGES.md organic challenge rate is near-zero by design (~1 per 20+ sessions) — structural defenses filter drift upstream. Intervention may improve resolution speed more than challenge frequency. **L-244 (strict S166–S181 window, n=20)**: 2 corrections/20 sessions (0.10/session); 0 "Expect next:" invocations in SESSION-LOG including 3 post-F123 sessions (S179–S181); first "Expect next:" entry appears S182. Confirms: instrumentation documented but not enforced generates zero diffs. **Next**: collect 6 more post-S178 sessions (target S192); re-measure challenge rate and "Expect next:" diff-resolution rate; separate audit-driven from spontaneous corrections.

| F-AI2 | CONFIRMED: async coordination reduces joint error 2.5x-6.7x vs full sync (n=3340+ across simulation+live EN/ES). Cascade coupling is graded by sync_inherit_prob; onset threshold ~0.25-0.50. Design implication: keep sync_inherit_prob < 0.25. L-542. | S350 | 2026-03-01 |
