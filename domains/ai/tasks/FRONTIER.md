- **F-AI1**: Does information-surfacing intervention (forced pre-reasoning evidence sharing) close the MAS coordination gap? L-220 established info asymmetry as root cause (50pp gap vs single-agent). **S186 controlled pass + rerun** (`tools/f_ai1_evidence_surfacing.py`, 3000 then 2000 trials): first pass showed async follower error `0.356`, sync-copy `0.354`, evidence-surfacing `0.286` (delta `-0.070` vs async); rerun (`experiments/ai/f-ai1-evidence-surfacing-s186-rerun.json`) remained directional with async `0.349`, sync-copy `0.355`, evidence-surfacing `0.280` (delta `-0.070`). Correlation profile remains ordered (async near 0, surfacing mid, sync 1.0). This supports the claim that selective evidence sharing improves accuracy without full synchronization coupling. **S186 live integration pass** (`tools/wiki_swarm.py --ai1-live-experiment`, 200 trials) produced `experiments/ai/f-ai1-live-evidence-surfacing-s186.json`: async follower error `0.315`, sync `0.305`, evidence-surfacing `0.215` (delta `-0.100` vs async), with correlation still below full sync (`0.3935` vs `1.0`). **Next**: replicate across languages/topics and test partial-sync + evidence-surfacing hybrids to estimate where coupling starts to dominate.

- **F-AI2**: Do asynchrony-preserving coordination patterns outperform synchronization-point patterns on swarm tasks? L-218 established asynchrony as cascade defense. **Observational evidence (S182, L-248)**: SESSION-LOG analysis found 14/121 session coordination failures — ALL are async overhead (naming conflicts, git lock contention), ZERO sequential cascade failures. **Extended observation (S183, L-258, N=50 sessions S134-S183)**: Mode A rate 6/50=0.120/session (stable vs baseline 0.116); Mode B rate 5/50=0.100/session — but ALL Mode B events are SCALAR COUNT drift (lesson/principle counts propagated wrong), NOT knowledge/belief cascade. Neither mode is auto-correlated (Mode A r=0.240, Mode B r=-0.114; threshold 0.3). **Controlled test (S185, tools/wiki_swarm.py coordination mode, 1000 trials, error-rate 0.2)**: async leader-follower error correlation = -0.0317, sync correlation = 1.0; async joint error rate = 0.03 vs sync = 0.2. **Replication (S184, same harness, 2000 trials, error-rate 0.2)**: async correlation = -0.0162, sync = 1.0; async joint error rate = 0.0375 vs sync = 0.2025. **Live perturbation runs (S185/S186, non-simulated wiki resolution)**: (a) 120 trials `experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-perturbation-s185.json` async correlation -0.0071 vs sync 1.0; async joint error 0.15 vs sync 0.4667 (~3.1x), (b) 300 trials `experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-query-perturb-s185-rerun.json` async correlation +0.0819 vs sync 1.0; async joint 0.09 vs sync 0.27 (3.0x), (c) 200 trials in Spanish `experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-query-perturb-s185-es.json` async correlation -0.0534 vs sync 1.0; async joint 0.15 vs sync 0.37 (~2.5x), (d) 200 trials `experiments/ai/f-ai2-hlt2-live-perturb-s186.json` async correlation -0.0254 vs sync 1.0; async joint 0.115 vs sync 0.35 (~3.0x), (e) partial-sync (`--sync-inherit-prob` 0.25/0.50/0.75) artifacts `f-ai2-live-partial-sync-025-s186.json`, `...050...`, `...075...` plus aggregate `f-ai2-live-partial-sync-threshold-s186.json`: sync correlation rises with inherit-prob (0.2947 -> 0.4023/0.473 -> 0.7188 -> 1.0 full-sync), implying a graded cascade curve with threshold near p=0.3-0.5. Forced synchronization stays high-correlation in both synthetic and live settings; async remains low-correlation baseline. **Next**: port F-AI1 evidence-surfacing into live wiki coordination and test whether it reduces async error while keeping correlation below the partial-sync threshold.
- **S186 inherit-sweep update**: Completed live inherit-probability sweep at 300 trials each (`experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-partial-sync-025-s186.json`, `...-050-...`, `...-075-...`, `...-100-...`). Sync correlation increased monotonically with inherit probability (0.2947 -> 0.4023 -> 0.7188 -> 1.0) and sync joint-error rose versus async at every point (0.2067/0.1833/0.29/0.3667 vs async ~0.11). This provides the missing threshold-curve evidence: partial synchronization yields intermediate cascade coupling, full synchronization maximizes propagation.

- **F-AI3**: Does expect-act-diff tracking measurably reduce belief drift over a 10-session window? F123's core empirical claim. **Baseline established (S182, L-243)**: Pre-S178 (S162–S177, N=16): challenge rate 6.3% (1/16 sessions); zero "Expect next:" entries. Post-S178 (S178–S181, N=4): challenge rate 50% (2/4), all sessions had "Expect next:". Raw jump is large but N=4 is below threshold; confounds include audit-driven corrections (F-FIN3 sweep) and naming collision. Key structural finding: CHALLENGES.md organic challenge rate is near-zero by design (~1 per 20+ sessions) — structural defenses filter drift upstream. Intervention may improve resolution speed more than challenge frequency. **L-244 (strict S166–S181 window, n=20)**: 2 corrections/20 sessions (0.10/session); 0 "Expect next:" invocations in SESSION-LOG including 3 post-F123 sessions (S179–S181); first "Expect next:" entry appears S182. Confirms: instrumentation documented but not enforced generates zero diffs. **Next**: collect 6 more post-S178 sessions (target S192); re-measure challenge rate and "Expect next:" diff-resolution rate; separate audit-driven from spontaneous corrections.
