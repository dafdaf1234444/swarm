- **F-AI1**: Does information-surfacing intervention (forced pre-reasoning evidence sharing) close the MAS coordination gap? L-220 established info asymmetry as root cause (50pp gap vs single-agent). **S186 controlled pass + rerun** (`tools/f_ai1_evidence_surfacing.py`, 3000 then 2000 trials): first pass showed async follower error `0.356`, sync-copy `0.354`, evidence-surfacing `0.286` (delta `-0.070` vs async); rerun (`experiments/ai/f-ai1-evidence-surfacing-s186-rerun.json`) remained directional with async `0.349`, sync-copy `0.355`, evidence-surfacing `0.280` (delta `-0.070`). Correlation profile remains ordered (async near 0, surfacing mid, sync 1.0). This supports the claim that selective evidence sharing improves accuracy without full synchronization coupling. **Next**: port this intervention into live wiki workflow (shared evidence step before final answer) and measure whether gain persists under real fetch noise.

- **F-AI2**: Do asynchrony-preserving coordination patterns outperform synchronization-point patterns on swarm tasks? L-218 established asynchrony as cascade defense. **Observational evidence (S182, L-248)**: SESSION-LOG analysis found 14/121 session coordination failures — ALL are async overhead (naming conflicts, git lock contention), ZERO sequential cascade failures. **Extended observation (S183, L-258, N=50 sessions S134-S183)**: Mode A rate 6/50=0.120/session (stable vs baseline 0.116); Mode B rate 5/50=0.100/session — but ALL Mode B events are SCALAR COUNT drift (lesson/principle counts propagated wrong), NOT knowledge/belief cascade. Neither mode is auto-correlated (Mode A r=0.240, Mode B r=-0.114; threshold 0.3). **Controlled test (S185, tools/wiki_swarm.py coordination mode, 1000 trials, error-rate 0.2)**: async leader-follower error correlation = -0.0317, sync correlation = 1.0; async joint error rate = 0.03 vs sync = 0.2. **Replication (S184, same harness, 2000 trials, error-rate 0.2)**: async correlation = -0.0162, sync = 1.0; async joint error rate = 0.0375 vs sync = 0.2025. **Live perturbation runs (S185/S186, non-simulated wiki resolution)**: (a) 120 trials `experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-perturbation-s185.json` async correlation -0.0071 vs sync 1.0; async joint error 0.15 vs sync 0.4667 (~3.1x), (b) 300 trials `experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-query-perturb-s185-rerun.json` async correlation +0.0819 vs sync 1.0; async joint 0.09 vs sync 0.27 (3.0x), (c) 200 trials in Spanish `experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-query-perturb-s185-es.json` async correlation -0.0534 vs sync 1.0; async joint 0.15 vs sync 0.37 (~2.5x), (d) 200 trials `experiments/ai/f-ai2-hlt2-live-perturb-s186.json` async correlation -0.0254 vs sync 1.0; async joint 0.115 vs sync 0.35 (~3.0x), (e) 300 trials partial-sync (`--sync-inherit-prob 0.5`) `experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-partial-sync-s185.json`: sync correlation drops to 0.473 with joint error 0.2067 (between async 0.10 and full-sync 0.27), consistent with graded cascade intensity. Forced synchronization stays high-correlation in both synthetic and live settings; async remains low-correlation and lower joint-error. **Next**: run inherit-prob sweep (0.25/0.5/0.75/1.0) to estimate cascade threshold curve and then decide F-AI2/F-HLT2 resolution status.

- **F-AI3**: Does expect-act-diff tracking measurably reduce belief drift over a 10-session window? F123's core empirical claim. **Baseline established (S182, L-243)**: Pre-S178 (S162–S177, N=16): challenge rate 6.3% (1/16 sessions); zero "Expect next:" entries. Post-S178 (S178–S181, N=4): challenge rate 50% (2/4), all sessions had "Expect next:". Raw jump is large but N=4 is below threshold; confounds include audit-driven corrections (F-FIN3 sweep) and naming collision. Key structural finding: CHALLENGES.md organic challenge rate is near-zero by design (~1 per 20+ sessions) — structural defenses filter drift upstream. Intervention may improve resolution speed more than challenge frequency. **L-244 (strict S166–S181 window, n=20)**: 2 corrections/20 sessions (0.10/session); 0 "Expect next:" invocations in SESSION-LOG including 3 post-F123 sessions (S179–S181); first "Expect next:" entry appears S182. Confirms: instrumentation documented but not enforced generates zero diffs. **Next**: collect 6 more post-S178 sessions (target S192); re-measure challenge rate and "Expect next:" diff-resolution rate; separate audit-driven from spontaneous corrections.
