# Domain: AI Systems
Topic: Multi-agent coordination bottlenecks, capability vs. verification independence, and structural isomorphisms between AI coordination patterns and swarm design.
Beliefs: B17 (info asymmetry = dominant MAS bottleneck, OBSERVED), B18 (capability⊥vigilance, OBSERVED), B19 (async prevents cascade anchoring, OBSERVED)
Lessons: L-218 (asynchrony cascade defense), L-219 (capability⊥vigilance), L-220 (info asymmetry dominance), L-222 (domain swarming via isomorphism)
Frontiers: F-AI1 (information-surfacing intervention), F-AI2 (async vs sync cascade behavior), F-AI3 (expect-act-diff drift reduction)
Experiments: experiments/ai/
