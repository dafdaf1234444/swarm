# Domain: AI Systems
Topic: Multi-agent coordination bottlenecks, capability vs. verification independence, and structural isomorphisms between AI coordination patterns and swarm design.
Beliefs: B-AI1 (information asymmetry is the dominant MAS bottleneck, OBSERVED), B-AI2 (capability and vigilance are independent axes, OBSERVED), B-AI3 (asynchrony prevents cascade anchoring, OBSERVED)
Lessons: L-218 (asynchrony cascade defense), L-219 (capability⊥vigilance), L-220 (info asymmetry dominance), L-222 (domain swarming via isomorphism)
Frontiers: F122 (knowledge-domain swarming), F123 (expect-act-diff)
Experiments: experiments/ai/
