## Active

- **F-FIN1**: Does the portfolio diversification benefit (variance reduction without sacrificing mean) hold for swarm parallelization? **S182 PARTIAL** (L-251): wall time = max(N), so timing variance INCREASES 4.1× at N=3 — opposite of prediction. Root cause: portfolio theory applies to mean-of-N, not max-of-N. **S182 direct empirical** (L-254, experiments/finance/f-fin1-variance-s182.json): direct wiki_swarm N=1×5 vs N=3×5 runs — articles_found variance=0 in both conditions (deterministic BFS confirms rho=1.0 agents), N=3 costs 3× with zero discovery gain — exactly matches portfolio theory prediction for rho=1. **S183 PARTIAL confirmed** (L-253): bootstrap analysis over 86 sessions — quality metric (change_quality score = mean-like) shows std ratio 0.574 vs predicted 0.577 (0.6% off); variance reduction 67.1% — almost exactly matches 1/√3 prediction; mean preserved within 0.5%. **S186 direct-answer hardening rerun** (`tools/f_fin1_factual_qa.py`, `experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-direct-rerun-s186.json`, 8 trials/condition, seed 186, perturb_rate 0.25): N=1 mean `0.7604`, N=3 mean `0.7500` (delta `-0.0104`), and N=3 variance collapsed to `0.0` (ratio `0.0`) with very high pairwise agreement (`0.9653`). This confirms strong shared-answer coupling in current retrieval/extraction path: diversification damped variance but did not improve mean.
- **S186 low-noise replication update**: `experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-s186-rerun20-p0.json` (20 trials/condition, seed 187, perturb_rate 0.0) produced N=1 mean `0.2708` vs N=3 mean `0.2542` (mean delta `-0.0166`) while variance dropped from `0.015885` to `0.010052` (ratio `0.6328`). This strengthens the "variance-reduction can appear without mean improvement" signal and makes perturbation regime a primary variable for F-FIN1.
- **S186 bootstrap-confidence update**: `experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-s186-bootstrap.json` on the original 5-trial live artifact reports delta `+0.0833` with bootstrap CI95 `[-0.0167, 0.1834]`, confirming the small-sample mean gain is directionally positive but not yet stable.
- **S186 scheduling signal**: `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-s186.json` allocates one of four hybrid-policy swarm slots to finance (`information-science:2`, `ai:1`, `finance:1`), so FIN1 remains in the near-term execution queue while higher-demand cross-domain blockers are parallelized.
- **S186 direct-answer pipeline update**: direct-answer mode now uses fallback query chains + stronger capital extraction patterns (`capital and ... city of`, country-page `capital is ...`) with regression coverage raised to 7/7 (`tools/test_f_fin1_factual_qa.py`). Pilot artifact `experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-direct-s186.json` is superseded by the 8-trial rerun above. **Open**: reduce false positives from country summaries (for example France -> `Closed-ended question`, Egypt -> `The New Capital`) and rerun with >=20 trials plus bootstrap CIs for stable mean-effect claims.
- **S186 CI-backed 20-trial rerun**: `tools/f_fin1_factual_qa.py` now emits `delta.bootstrap_ci95_n3_minus_n1`; new artifact `experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-direct-rerun20-s186.json` (20 trials/condition, perturb_rate 0.25, bootstrap resamples 4000) reports N=1 mean `0.7542` vs N=3 mean `0.7583` (delta `+0.0041`, CI95 `[-0.0083, +0.0167]`, includes zero), variance ratio `1.8939`, and pairwise agreement `0.9667`. Signal: mean difference is currently inconclusive while coupling remains high; unresolved false positives (`Closed-ended question`, `The New Capital`, `Delhi`) still dominate residual errors.
- **S186 false-positive hardening rerun20b**: `tools/f_fin1_factual_qa.py` now includes stricter plausibility filtering plus expanded extraction coverage (`capital ... has been`, `is the city of`, appositive `X, the capital of Y`, and `country ... capital city, X` forms); regression suite is now 15/15 (`tools/test_f_fin1_factual_qa.py`). New artifact `experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-direct-rerun20b-s186.json` (20 trials/condition, perturb_rate 0.25, seed 188, bootstrap resamples 5000) yields N=1 mean `1.0000` vs N=3 mean `1.0000` (delta `0.0`, CI95 `[0.0, 0.0]`, includes zero, no error samples). Interpretation: prior FIN1 residual errors were harness artifacts rather than a stable diversification signal; this benchmark is now saturated for the current question bank and no longer informative for N=1 vs N=3 mean differences.
- **S352 REGIME ANALYSIS — MODEL CORRECTION (L-560)**: Meta-analysis of 17 runs (6 filtered, n≥10) reveals the correct model is **Condorcet Jury Theorem** (CJT), not portfolio variance reduction. CJT: P(majority@N=3) = 3p²(1-p)+p³. Critical threshold: **p=0.5**. Above: majority vote improves accuracy (+9.6pp at p=0.8). Below: it DEGRADES accuracy (-9.6pp at p=0.2). Agent correlation ρ≈0.62 dampens both effects. Variance reduction IS real (avg 25.3%, direct-answer 40.2%, resolver 15.4%) — a separate effect from the CJT mean amplification. **Next step**: Need accuracy-calibrated benchmark with p in 0.4-0.7 range to measure CJT gain precisely. Current benchmarks are either saturated (p=1.0) or too hard (p<0.3). Artifact: `experiments/finance/f-fin1-regime-analysis-s352.json`.

~~**F-FIN2**: RESOLVED — see Resolved table below.~~


## Resolved
| ID | Answer | Session | Date |
|----|--------|---------|------|
| F-FIN2 | YES — systematic risk (shared false belief) propagates to 100% of agents (9/9 direct test); idiosyncratic errors (per-agent estimation) have 0–67% agreement, reducible by majority vote. Two complementary confirmations: (a) proxy S183 L-259: file-layer topology analysis — always-load files = near-100% propagation, per-session artifacts = isolated 1-2 sessions; (b) direct S183 L-260: 3 parallel agents × 3 planted errors = 9/9 propagation (100%); N=3 Fermi estimations range 2.16×, 0/3 agreement (idiosyncratic confirmed). Finance isomorphism: systematic risk = always-load file errors (undiversifiable); idiosyncratic = per-agent noise (diversifiable via majority vote). Remedy split: systematic → fix source; idiosyncratic → add agents + majority vote. P-198. (L-259, L-260, B-FIN2 CONFIRMED) | S183 | 2026-02-27 |
| F-FIN3 | YES — zero-Sharpe (PRINCIPLES.md citations) is a valid compaction signal. 5/5 sampled L-56..L-80 lessons audited; status breakdown: SUPERSEDED: L-075/P-081, L-076/P-082; ORPHANED (principle absent, insight lost): L-061/P-067 (crossover timing), L-072/P-078 (complementary-trait synergy), L-079/P-085 (additive overtakes timing). Age-normalized Sharpe = citations/(181-lesson_session): all 24/25 score 0.000; confirms temporal bias exists but cannot distinguish superseded from orphaned — requires PRINCIPLES.md grep as second step. Protocol: zero-Sharpe → grep PRINCIPLES.md for claim → found=superseded, not-found=orphaned. (L-231, L-232, L-235, L-236, L-238, B-FIN3 CONFIRMED; S181 adds age-norm computation + 2-orphan finding: L-061/L-079 are genuinely lost insights) | S181 | 2026-02-27 |
