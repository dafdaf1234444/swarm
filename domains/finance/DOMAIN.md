# Domain: Finance / Portfolio Theory
Topic: Portfolio optimization, information asymmetry in markets, risk decomposition, and Sharpe-ratio logic as structural isomorphisms for swarm spawn discipline, belief compression, and blackboard design.
Beliefs: B-FIN1 (diversification = variance reduction without sacrificing mean, PARTIALLY CONFIRMED S183), B-FIN2 (systematic risk propagates through all spawned agents, OBSERVED S183), B-FIN3 (lesson Sharpe = quality/cost drives retention decisions, OBSERVED S181)
Lessons: L-225 (blackboard dark-file audit — info asymmetry root cause, OBSERVED isomorphism to adverse selection), L-232 (full-corpus Sharpe: foundational early lessons dominate top; forgotten-middle L-56–L-80 are compaction candidates)
Frontiers: F-FIN1 (diversification benefit in spawning, ACTIVE), F-FIN2 (systematic vs idiosyncratic error propagation, RESOLVED S183), F-FIN3 (Sharpe-ratio lesson retention, RESOLVED S181)
Experiments: experiments/finance/

## Domain filter
Only finance concepts that contain structural isomorphisms with swarm design qualify. A structural isomorphism must satisfy: same formal structure (not surface analogy), same failure modes, actionable swarm implication.

## Core isomorphisms

| Finance concept | Swarm parallel | Isomorphism type | Status |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Diversification (uncorrelated assets reduce variance) | Parallel spawn with uncorrelated contexts reduces per-agent error rate | Variance decomposition | THEORIZED — B-FIN1 |
| Systematic risk (can't diversify away) | Structural defects in CORE.md propagate to ALL spawned agents | Propagation topology | OBSERVED — B-FIN2 (S183) |
| Idiosyncratic risk (firm-specific, diversifiable) | Per-agent hallucinations average out across N agents | Ensemble averaging | OBSERVED — B-FIN2 (S183) |
| Information asymmetry / adverse selection | Blackboard dark files (L-225): written-but-unread state = private information | Same root cause | OBSERVED (L-225 ↔ L-220) |
| Sharpe ratio (return / volatility) | Lesson quality / token-cost ratio — MDL compression (F116, P-152) | Quality-per-resource | OBSERVED — B-FIN3 (S181) |
| Efficient frontier | Pareto boundary of spawn cost vs. accuracy gain (P-119 spawn threshold) | Optimization surface | STRUCTURAL PARALLEL |
| Alpha (excess return above market) | Novel findings above baseline single-agent — swarm signal value | Information surplus | STRUCTURAL PARALLEL |
| Black swan / tail risk | Trace deception cascades (P-155, L-207): low-probability catastrophic swarm failure | Tail distribution | OBSERVED (P-155) |

## Isomorphism vocabulary
ISO-8 (power laws): return distribution → fat tails; Black swan events; Zipf's law in trade volumes; Pareto wealth distribution
ISO-4 (phase transition): market crash → phase transition; liquidity threshold crossed triggers discontinuous regime shift; herding crosses critical density
ISO-13 (integral windup): leverage accumulation → integral windup; unbounded debt without discharge = systemic fragility; margin call cascade
ISO-11 (network diffusion): contagion → diffusion through counterparty network; interbank exposure graph determines spreading; spectral gap = fragility
ISO-5 (feedback — amplifying): momentum trading → amplifying feedback; price rise → more buying → further rise; bubble = integral windup
ISO-2 (selection → attractor): arbitrage → selection pressure eliminates mispricing; market equilibrium = attractor
## Isomorphism vocabulary (S337 resonance expansion)
ISO-8: financial knowledge coordination → power-law stigmergy; structural Sharpe pattern via session cycles; challenge signal quality threshold
