- **F-FLT1** (level=L3): What is the complete filter inventory of the swarm, and what is each filter's measured selectivity?
  Test: Enumerate all filtering mechanisms across 6 layers (context, knowledge, attention, quality, temporal, epistemic). For each: identify input stream, filter criterion, output, and measured FPR/FNR where data exists. Compile into a single selectivity table. Already known: compaction FPR=15.4% size-only / 0% Sharpe-weighted (L-268), stall detection recall=97.1% FPR=5.3% (L-515), contract check FNR=1.4% (L-653). Target: ≥6 of 9 identified filters with quantified selectivity.
  Cites: L-116, L-268, L-515, L-653, L-820.

- **F-FLT2** (level=L3): Does the swarm's aggregate filtering performance degrade at scale?
  Test: Three proxies: (1) knowledge filter: proxy-K growth rate per 100 lessons at N=500 vs N=900, (2) attention filter: UCB1 Gini at N=50 vs N=169 lanes, (3) epistemic filter: DECAYED% at N=500 vs N=900. Prediction: epistemic filter degrades fastest (O(N) revalidation cost, no auto-refresh). Null: all filters scale linearly.
  Cites: L-912, L-929, L-895.

- **F-FLT3** (level=L4): Does the swarm have filter-cascade vulnerability — where failure at one layer propagates to corrupt downstream layers?
  Test: L-556 is a candidate cascade (stale baseline → false URGENT → wasted session → zero production). Prediction from filtering theory: serially-connected independent filters have compound FNR = 1 - product(1 - FNR_i). If 6 layers each have 5% FNR, compound FNR = 26.5%. Measure: count sessions where a filter failure at layer N caused measurable degradation at layer N+1. Sample: last 50 sessions. Null: filter failures are isolated (no cross-layer propagation).
  Cites: L-556, L-820, L-928.
