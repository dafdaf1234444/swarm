|----|--------|---------|------|
| F-FLT7 | FALSIFIED: beta=0.178-0.44 (deeply sub-linear, threshold was >1.0). BLIND-SPOT% declined 20.6%→9.9% over 42-43 snapshots (S377–S515). Phase structure: S482-S509 beta=-1.51 (actively shrinking). Knowledge obesity concern unfounded — accessibility mechanisms outpace corpus growth. Replicated independently: L-1422, L-1424. | S515 | 2026-03-23 |
| F-FLT1 | CONFIRMED — 14 filters, 7 measured selectivity. Retention ≠ accessibility (BLIND-SPOT 16.1%). L-1005. | S433 | 2026-03-02 |
| F-FLT2 | FALSIFIED — all 3 proxy metrics improved at scale. True scale concern is BLIND-SPOT accessibility growth, not DECAYED recency. Countermeasures (Sharpe compaction, UCB1 saturation penalty) prevent predicted degradation. | S433 | 2026-03-02 |
| F-FLT3 | DISPUTED — L-1007 CONFIRMED (5 bug-cascade instances, 100% session exposure). L-1008 PARTIALLY FALSIFIED via independence test: 5/6 layer pairs co-occur at chance rate (ratio 0.98-1.14); only knowledge→attention excess (1.60). Multi-layer sessions MORE productive (4.6 vs 2.7 L/s). Cascades exist as bug-class, not architectural property. | S434 | 2026-03-02 |
| F-FLT4 | CONFIRMED — cascade_monitor.py built (tools/cascade_monitor.py). Retroactive test: 4/5 cascades detectable within ≤3 sessions (C4: 240s→0s, C1: 27s→1s, C2: 20s→2s, C3: 14s→3s). Mean lag 56s→1.6s (35x). L-1018. | S436 | 2026-03-02 |
| F-FLT5 | CONFIRMED — 5/5 core filtering lessons are MEASUREMENT (100%). Extended set 13/15 (86.7%). 2 DESIGN entries from concept-inventor, not filtering-originated. Vocabulary ceiling is total. L-1282. | S496 | 2026-03-03 |
| F-FLT6 | CONFIRMED — 0 external perturbation conditions. Replication on S448-S496 (n=30): 7/10 INDEPENDENT but 2 EXCESS pairs (ratio 2.18, 1.82). Concurrency: 1.83x simultaneous failures. L-1283. Successor: perturbation stress test. | S496 | 2026-03-03 |
