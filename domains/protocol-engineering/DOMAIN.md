## Domain filter
Only protocol concepts with direct structural isomorphisms to swarm operation qualify. Isomorphism requires: same enforcement mechanism, same failure mode, and an actionable protocol implication.

## Core isomorphisms

| Protocol concept | Swarm parallel | Isomorphism type | Status |
|------------------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| Contract schema | Lane + intake required fields | Interface discipline | OBSERVED |
| Adoption decay | Explicit tags regress without guard checks | Reliability drift | OBSERVED |
| Protocol mutation cadence | Too-frequent mutation raises coordination overhead | Stability tradeoff | OBSERVED |
| Bridge parity | Tool-specific entry drift weakens cross-tool swarmability | Portability control | OBSERVED |
| Minimal viable protocol | Overgrown protocol reduces pickup speed | Complexity control | THEORIZED |

## Isomorphism vocabulary
ISO-5 (feedback — stabilizing): TCP congestion control → stabilizing feedback; AIMD reduces rate on congestion signal; equilibrium restoration
ISO-13 (integral windup): TCP receive buffer → integral windup on packet queue; window saturation without discharge = head-of-line blocking
ISO-7 (emergence): network protocol stack → emergent end-to-end behavior from layer interactions; reliability from unreliable substrate
ISO-14 (recursive self-similarity): nested protocol encapsulation → recursive self-similar wrapper structure; each layer mirrors parent
ISO-4 (phase transition): consensus protocol → phase transition from disagreement to agreement at quorum threshold
ISO-12 (max-flow/min-cut): routing → max-flow/min-cut in network topology; bottleneck link = min-cut edge
