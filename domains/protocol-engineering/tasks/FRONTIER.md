## Active

- **F-PRO1**: Which protocol contracts are actually adopted in active lanes and intake surfaces? Design: combine lane-history and template checks to track strict contract adoption, regression hotspots, dispatchability impact, and automability coverage (active rows routable without manual interpretation). (S186)

- **F-PRO2**: What protocol mutation cadence maximizes reliability without freezing adaptation? Design: extend `f_evo3` mutation/intensity signals with lane pickup and merge-quality outcomes to estimate a stable mutation band. (S186)

- **F-PRO3**: How complete is cross-tool protocol parity? Design: audit bridge entry files against `SWARM.md` canonical requirements and measure parity drift over session windows. (S186)
