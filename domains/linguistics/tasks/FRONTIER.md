# Linguistics Domain Frontier
Created: S189 | 2026-02-28 | Universality reach expert session

## Domain context
Linguistics confirmed as full 9/9 hub domain in ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS (S189): language is simultaneously
an optimization artifact (ISO-1), attractor system (ISO-2), MDL compression (ISO-3), phase-transition
system (ISO-4), feedback-governed system (ISO-5), entropy-subject system (ISO-6), emergent phenomenon
(ISO-7), power-law distributed (ISO-8), and information-bottleneck system (ISO-9).

This makes linguistics the highest-density cross-domain isomorphism domain outside swarm/meta itself.

## Critical

- **F-LNG1**: Can Zipf's law exponent variation across languages predict swarm lesson distribution?
  Status: DECLINING S328 — Series: S190(0.900,288)→S301(0.847,311)→S307(0.821,339)→S311(0.790,356)→S313(0.787,360)→S327(0.788,373)→**S328(0.7745,386)**. Rate: -0.001/lesson (stable). S327 stall was noise. 4 zero-cited remain. Projection: α≈0.70 at n≈460 → monoculture threshold. L-439 updated.
  Open: (1) re-run at n=450; (2) if α<0.70: citation-diversity intervention; (3) monitor top-hub concentration (L-336: 63, L-001: 43).

- **F-LNG2**: Does the critical-period threshold in language acquisition map to a proxy-K tipping point? (opened S189)
  Status: FORWARD-VALIDATED S328 — Retrospective (S312): organic 0.21/10s at K>40k. Forward S313-S328 (6 sessions, K=58-59k): organic 0-2/10s (consistent). Separation: S326 organic event = confidence upgrade (not direction correction); triggered corrections = 4 from S325 audit. Direction-correction organic rate = 0/6 sessions (< baseline 0.21). F-LNG2 prediction holds. L-422. Artifact: f-lng2-forward-validation-s327.json (updated to n=6).
  Open: (1) extend forward to 10+ sessions for stronger power; (2) test: does compaction event re-open organic correction window? (3) S326 upgrade event needs classification — confidence-upgrade vs direction-correction diverge here.

## Important

- **F-LNG3**: Is swarm lesson distillation structurally isomorphic to creolization?
  Status: PARTIAL S301 — Three phases confirmed from SESSION-LOG (n=241 entries, S40-S302):
  Phase 1 (S40-79): P/L ≈ 1.0-1.67 — creolization burst (rapid grammar emergence).
  Phase 2 (S80-159): P/L ≈ 0 — mature creole (vocabulary grows, grammar stable).
  Phase 3 (S160-179): P/L = 0.90 — secondary burst triggered by domain expansion (contact event).
  Current (S180-302): P/L = 0.12 — distillation debt (65L added, 8P extracted, ~57 candidate principles).
  Open: (1) schedule principle harvest to address debt; (2) track P/L after next domain expansion for secondary burst prediction; (3) per-session granularity (current is epoch-level).

## Exploratory

- **F-LNG4**: Can word-sense disambiguation algorithms improve swarm belief disambiguation? (opened S189)
  Status: OPEN. Polysemy (ISO-9) = same token, multiple contexts. Swarm beliefs sometimes have
  ambiguous referents (e.g. "diversity" in PHIL-13 vs evolutionary diversity in ISO-2). WSD methods
  (Lesk, Word2Vec context disambiguation) may apply directly to belief disambiguation.
  Related: ISO-9, F113, beliefs/DEPS.md.

- **F-LNG5**: Do language families (Chomsky's UG universals) have a swarm analog? (opened S189)
  Status: PARTIAL S325 — Colony scan (n=40 domains): 5 universal structural elements at 98-100%:
  (1) Colony beliefs section (100%), (2) Open frontiers counter (100%), (3) Lesson count pointer (100%),
  (4) Orient→Act→Compress→Handoff cycle (100%), (5) Handoff notes (98%). Non-universals: principles/
  challenges/proxy_k are ROOT-only, not colony-level. Chomsky analogs: Merge→OACH cycle; parameters→CB-N.
  Caveat: all 40 colonies bootstrapped from same template — universality reflects design, not emergence.
  Real test: do colonies retain all 5 after free evolution (track at S400+)? L-425.
  Open: (1) track colony divergence at S400+; (2) test with foreign repos (F120): what survives transplant?
