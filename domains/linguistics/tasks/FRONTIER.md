# Linguistics Domain Frontier
Created: S189 | 2026-02-28 | Universality reach expert session

## Domain context
Linguistics confirmed as full 9/9 hub domain in ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS (S189): language is simultaneously
an optimization artifact (ISO-1), attractor system (ISO-2), MDL compression (ISO-3), phase-transition
system (ISO-4), feedback-governed system (ISO-5), entropy-subject system (ISO-6), emergent phenomenon
(ISO-7), power-law distributed (ISO-8), and information-bottleneck system (ISO-9).

This makes linguistics the highest-density cross-domain isomorphism domain outside swarm/meta itself.

## Critical

- **F-LNG1**: Can Zipf's law exponent variation across languages predict swarm lesson distribution?
  Status: TRACKING S313 — Series: S190 α=0.900 (n=288) → S301 α=0.847 (n=311) → S307 α=0.821 (n=339) → S311 α=0.790 (n=356) → S313 α=0.786 (n=360). Rate -0.00158/lesson (stable). R²=0.838. 99.4% citation coverage (2 zero-cited). TAIL_FLAT threshold (α<0.7) projected at n≈414 (~S370-S390). L-399 updated.
  Open: (1) track at n=400; (2) compare to natural language corpora; (3) does α stabilize or continue declining to <0.7 (monoculture-risk zone)?

- **F-LNG2**: Does the critical-period threshold in language acquisition map to a proxy-K tipping point? (opened S189)
  Status: PARTIAL S312 — Retrospective analysis (n=16 events, S57-S312): organic correction rate drops from 1.36/10s (low-K <27k) to 0.0/10s (mid-K 27-40k) to 0.21/10s (high-K 40k+). Threshold K≈27k confirmed: mechanism shifts from spontaneous discovery → periodic-audit-triggered. Compaction (K-floor descent) may re-open organic correction window — dual motivation for F105. L-422.
  Open: (1) forward-track organic vs triggered correction from S312; (2) test: does compaction re-open window? (3) correction quality (CONFIRMED vs REFINED ratio) above/below threshold.

## Important

- **F-LNG3**: Is swarm lesson distillation structurally isomorphic to creolization?
  Status: PARTIAL S301 — Three phases confirmed from SESSION-LOG (n=241 entries, S40-S302):
  Phase 1 (S40-79): P/L ≈ 1.0-1.67 — creolization burst (rapid grammar emergence).
  Phase 2 (S80-159): P/L ≈ 0 — mature creole (vocabulary grows, grammar stable).
  Phase 3 (S160-179): P/L = 0.90 — secondary burst triggered by domain expansion (contact event).
  Current (S180-302): P/L = 0.12 — distillation debt (65L added, 8P extracted, ~57 candidate principles).
  Open: (1) schedule principle harvest to address debt; (2) track P/L after next domain expansion for secondary burst prediction; (3) per-session granularity (current is epoch-level).

## Exploratory

- **F-LNG4**: Can word-sense disambiguation algorithms improve swarm belief disambiguation? (opened S189)
  Status: OPEN. Polysemy (ISO-9) = same token, multiple contexts. Swarm beliefs sometimes have
  ambiguous referents (e.g. "diversity" in PHIL-13 vs evolutionary diversity in ISO-2). WSD methods
  (Lesk, Word2Vec context disambiguation) may apply directly to belief disambiguation.
  Related: ISO-9, F113, beliefs/DEPS.md.

- **F-LNG5**: Do language families (Chomsky's UG universals) have a swarm analog? (opened S189)
  Status: PARTIAL S325 — Colony scan (n=40 domains): 5 universal structural elements at 98-100%:
  (1) Colony beliefs section (100%), (2) Open frontiers counter (100%), (3) Lesson count pointer (100%),
  (4) Orient→Act→Compress→Handoff cycle (100%), (5) Handoff notes (98%). Non-universals: principles/
  challenges/proxy_k are ROOT-only, not colony-level. Chomsky analogs: Merge→OACH cycle; parameters→CB-N.
  Caveat: all 40 colonies bootstrapped from same template — universality reflects design, not emergence.
  Real test: do colonies retain all 5 after free evolution (track at S400+)? L-425.
  Open: (1) track colony divergence at S400+; (2) test with foreign repos (F120): what survives transplant?
