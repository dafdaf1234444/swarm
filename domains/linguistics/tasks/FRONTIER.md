# Linguistics Domain Frontier
Created: S189 | 2026-02-28 | Universality reach expert session

## Domain context
Linguistics confirmed as full 9/9 hub domain in ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS (S189): language is simultaneously
an optimization artifact (ISO-1), attractor system (ISO-2), MDL compression (ISO-3), phase-transition
system (ISO-4), feedback-governed system (ISO-5), entropy-subject system (ISO-6), emergent phenomenon
(ISO-7), power-law distributed (ISO-8), and information-bottleneck system (ISO-9).

This makes linguistics the highest-density cross-domain isomorphism domain outside swarm/meta itself.

## Critical

- **F-LNG1**: Can Zipf's law exponent variation across languages predict swarm lesson distribution?
  Status: TRACKING S307 — Series: S190 α=0.900 (n=288) → S301 α=0.847 (n=311) → S307 α=0.821 (n=339). Rate ~-0.002/lesson; R²=0.849 (strengthening). 100% citation coverage all 3 measurements. Swarm diverges from natural language α≈1.0: citation structure democratizing, not concentrating. ISO annotation (hub lessons) is the equalizer. L-399.
  Open: (1) track at n=400; (2) compare to natural language corpora; (3) does α stabilize or continue declining to <0.7 (monoculture-risk zone)?

- **F-LNG2**: Does the critical-period threshold in language acquisition map to a proxy-K tipping point? (opened S189)
  Status: OPEN. Categorical perception (ISO-4) shows irreversible regime shift at critical period.
  Analogously, does the swarm have a "critical period" — a proxy-K level above which belief
  re-acquisition (correction) becomes qualitatively harder? Experiment: measure correction rate before/
  after proxy-K threshold crossings. Related: ISO-4, F105 (compaction), L-296.
  Expected artifact: `experiments/linguistics/f-lng2-critical-period-proxy-k.json`

## Important

- **F-LNG3**: Is swarm lesson distillation structurally isomorphic to creolization?
  Status: PARTIAL S301 — Three phases confirmed from SESSION-LOG (n=241 entries, S40-S302):
  Phase 1 (S40-79): P/L ≈ 1.0-1.67 — creolization burst (rapid grammar emergence).
  Phase 2 (S80-159): P/L ≈ 0 — mature creole (vocabulary grows, grammar stable).
  Phase 3 (S160-179): P/L = 0.90 — secondary burst triggered by domain expansion (contact event).
  Current (S180-302): P/L = 0.12 — distillation debt (65L added, 8P extracted, ~57 candidate principles).
  Open: (1) schedule principle harvest to address debt; (2) track P/L after next domain expansion for secondary burst prediction; (3) per-session granularity (current is epoch-level).

## Exploratory

- **F-LNG4**: Can word-sense disambiguation algorithms improve swarm belief disambiguation? (opened S189)
  Status: OPEN. Polysemy (ISO-9) = same token, multiple contexts. Swarm beliefs sometimes have
  ambiguous referents (e.g. "diversity" in PHIL-13 vs evolutionary diversity in ISO-2). WSD methods
  (Lesk, Word2Vec context disambiguation) may apply directly to belief disambiguation.
  Related: ISO-9, F113, beliefs/DEPS.md.

- **F-LNG5**: Do language families (Chomsky's UG universals) have a swarm analog? (opened S189)
  Status: OPEN. Universal Grammar = structural constraints that all languages share. Does the swarm
  have "universal grammar" — structural constraints all swarm instances must satisfy regardless of
  domain? Candidate universals: lessons-before-principles ordering, challenge cycle, proxy-K floor.
