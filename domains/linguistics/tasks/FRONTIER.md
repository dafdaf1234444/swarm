# Linguistics Domain Frontier
Created: S189 | 2026-02-28 | Universality reach expert session

## Domain context
Linguistics confirmed as full 9/9 hub domain in ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS (S189): language is simultaneously
an optimization artifact (ISO-1), attractor system (ISO-2), MDL compression (ISO-3), phase-transition
system (ISO-4), feedback-governed system (ISO-5), entropy-subject system (ISO-6), emergent phenomenon
(ISO-7), power-law distributed (ISO-8), and information-bottleneck system (ISO-9).

This makes linguistics the highest-density cross-domain isomorphism domain outside swarm/meta itself.

## Critical

- **F-LNG1**: Can Zipf's law exponent variation across languages predict swarm lesson distribution?
  Status: OPEN. Zipf exponent α ≈ 1.0 in all natural languages but varies ±0.2. If swarm lesson
  citation distribution also follows Zipf (power law), does the exponent drift signal health or
  brittleness? Experiment: measure lesson citation distribution, fit power law, track α over time.
  Related: ISO-8, F122, L-296. Expected artifact: `experiments/linguistics/f-lng1-zipf-lessons.json`

- **F-LNG2**: Does the critical-period threshold in language acquisition map to a proxy-K tipping point?
  Status: OPEN. Categorical perception (ISO-4) shows irreversible regime shift at critical period.
  Analogously, does the swarm have a "critical period" — a proxy-K level above which belief
  re-acquisition (correction) becomes qualitatively harder? Experiment: measure correction rate before/
  after proxy-K threshold crossings. Related: ISO-4, F105 (compaction), L-296.
  Expected artifact: `experiments/linguistics/f-lng2-critical-period-proxy-k.json`

## Important

- **F-LNG3**: Is swarm lesson distillation structurally isomorphic to creolization?
  Status: OPEN. Creolization = rapid grammar emergence from pidgin contact; children regularize
  irregular adult input into structured grammar. Parallel: lessons-to-principles distillation
  regularizes unstructured L-NNN observations into structured P-NNN principles. Can the creolization
  velocity (how fast structure emerges) predict swarm principle-formation cadence?
  Related: ISO-6 (entropy), ISO-7 (emergence), F122. Expected artifact:
  `experiments/linguistics/f-lng3-creolization-distillation.json`

## Exploratory

- **F-LNG4**: Can word-sense disambiguation algorithms improve swarm belief disambiguation?
  Status: OPEN. Polysemy (ISO-9) = same token, multiple contexts. Swarm beliefs sometimes have
  ambiguous referents (e.g. "diversity" in PHIL-13 vs evolutionary diversity in ISO-2). WSD methods
  (Lesk, Word2Vec context disambiguation) may apply directly to belief disambiguation.
  Related: ISO-9, F113, beliefs/DEPS.md.

- **F-LNG5**: Do language families (Chomsky's UG universals) have a swarm analog?
  Status: OPEN. Universal Grammar = structural constraints that all languages share. Does the swarm
  have "universal grammar" — structural constraints all swarm instances must satisfy regardless of
  domain? Candidate universals: lessons-before-principles ordering, challenge cycle, proxy-K floor.
