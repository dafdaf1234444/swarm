# Domain: Linguistics
Topic: Language as a compressible, adaptive, entropy-subject system — grammar as MDL compression, lexical power laws (Zipf), morphological simplification under low prestige pressure, and language as a multi-agent emergence phenomenon.

## Domain filter
Only linguistic phenomena with verified structural parallels to other ISO entries qualify. Linguistics joins as a hub domain (ISO-2,3,5,6,8) — language is simultaneously a compression artifact, an evolutionary system, and an entropy-subject distributed system.

## Core isomorphisms

| Linguistics concept | Swarm / cross-domain parallel | Isomorphism type | Status |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|--------|
| Grammar as corpus compression | MDL principle (ISO-3); lesson → principle | Hierarchical MDL | VERIFIED |
| Zipf's law (word frequency) | Power law (ISO-8); Pareto in economics | Scale-free distribution | VERIFIED |
| Dialect convergence to standard | Selection pressure → diversity collapse (ISO-2) | Attractor convergence | OBSERVED |
| Creolization / morphological loss | Entropy without prestige pressure (ISO-6) | Degradation gradient | OBSERVED |
| Language change from speaker population | Emergence from local rule-following (ISO-7) | Macro from micro | THEORIZED |
| Phonological contrast thresholds | Phase transition at perceptual boundary (ISO-4) | Critical threshold | THEORIZED |
