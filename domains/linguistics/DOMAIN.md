# Domain: Linguistics
Topic: Language as a compressible, adaptive, entropy-subject system — grammar as MDL compression, lexical power laws (Zipf), morphological simplification under low prestige pressure, and language as a multi-agent emergence phenomenon.

## Domain filter
Only linguistic phenomena with verified structural parallels to other ISO entries qualify. Linguistics joins as a hub domain (ISO-2,3,5,6,8) — language is simultaneously a compression artifact, an evolutionary system, and an entropy-subject distributed system.

## Core isomorphisms

| Linguistics concept | Swarm / cross-domain parallel | Isomorphism type | Status |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|--------|
| Grammar as corpus compression | MDL principle (ISO-3); lesson → principle | Hierarchical MDL | VERIFIED |
| Zipf's law (word frequency) | Power law (ISO-8); Pareto in economics | Scale-free distribution | VERIFIED |
| Language acquisition as constraint optimization | Optimization-under-constraint (ISO-1); Bayesian/P&P/usage-based all = posterior max under poverty-of-stimulus constraint | Constrained optimization | VERIFIED (S189) |
| Categorical perception / critical period | Phase transition (ISO-4); VOT /b/–/p/ boundary = discontinuous regime shift; critical period = irreversible threshold | Critical threshold | VERIFIED (S189) |
| Nicaraguan Sign Language / construction grammar | Emergence (ISO-7); NSL grammar not predictable from any child's gestures; macro from micro | Irreducible emergence | VERIFIED (S189) |
| Polysemy / translation loss / word learning | Information bottleneck (ISO-9); many referents → one token; translation discards untranslatable nuance | Lossy relevance compression | VERIFIED (S189) |
| Dialect convergence to standard | Selection pressure → diversity collapse (ISO-2) | Attractor convergence | OBSERVED |
| Creolization / morphological loss | Entropy without prestige pressure (ISO-6) | Degradation gradient | OBSERVED |
| Feedback in language change (prestige pressure) | Stabilizing/amplifying feedback (ISO-5); standard prestige = negative feedback; slang virality = positive | Dual-loop feedback | OBSERVED |
