# Domain: Cryptography
Topic: Cryptographic primitives — hash functions, asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, commitment schemes, and their formal security properties (collision resistance, binding, hiding, soundness). Primary value: cryptography formalizes information-preservation guarantees and proof-without-revelation patterns that have direct swarm analogs in compaction, belief commitment, and verifiable claims.
Beliefs: B1 (evidence over assertion — ZKP analog), B14 (structural reproducibility), connects to protocol-engineering domain (cryptographic protocols), distributed-systems domain (Byzantine fault tolerance, authenticated channels), information-science domain (entropy, information-theoretic security)
Lessons: (none yet)
Frontiers: F-CRY1, F-CRY2, F-CRY3
Related: domains/distributed-systems/ (BFT, authenticated messaging), domains/protocol-engineering/ (TLS, SSH, secure channels), domains/information-science/ (entropy bounds, compression), domains/cryptocurrency/ (hash chains, Merkle proofs)
