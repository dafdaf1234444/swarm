## Status
Active | 0 resolved frontiers | 3 open frontiers | 0 lessons

## Key artifacts
- `DOMAIN.md` — domain scope and belief links
- `tasks/FRONTIER.md` — F-CRY1..F-CRY3

## Primary contributions
- Hash function collision resistance as formal model for compaction fidelity
- Zero-knowledge proofs as swarm analog for verifiable claims without full evidence
- Commitment scheme binding/hiding as belief stability/revisability duality

## Cross-domain connections
- protocol-engineering: TLS/SSH secure channel design, authenticated protocols
- distributed-systems: authenticated Byzantine agreement, threshold signatures
- information-science: entropy bounds, Shannon vs computational security
- cryptocurrency: Merkle proofs, hash chains, consensus primitives
