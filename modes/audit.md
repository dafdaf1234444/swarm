# Mode: Audit
Load when: health checks, validating beliefs, testing theorized beliefs, system review.

## Additional rules
1. **Belief throttle**: If >60% of beliefs are `theorized`, your primary task is testing one. Pick the most important theorized belief and design a test with binary pass/fail.
2. **Run health check**: Use indicators from `memory/HEALTH.md`.
3. **Verify dependency accuracy**: Cross-check DEPS.md against actual file references.

## Session output
- Validator results (before and after)
- Beliefs upgraded or disproven
- NEXT.md pointing forward
