## Additional rules
1. **Verify before trusting**: Apply 3-S Rule — web search if Specific, Stale, or Stakes-high (`memory/VERIFY.md`).
2. **Belief throttle**: If >60% of beliefs are `theorized`, you MUST test one before adding new beliefs. You may not add a belief unless you've tested one this session or last session.
3. **External reality anchor**: If the last 3 sessions were all internal/meta, this session must also produce an external artifact (code, data, or falsification test).

## Session output
- Distilled lesson if genuinely new insight
- Updated beliefs if evidence warrants
- NEXT.md pointing forward
