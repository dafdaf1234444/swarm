# Mode: Research
Load when: web searching, reading sources, studying concepts, domain learning.

## Additional rules
1. **Expect-act-diff + check mode**: Log `check_mode`, expectation, and diff in `tasks/NEXT.md` or `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md` (see `memory/EXPECT.md`).
2. **Verify before trusting**: Apply 3-S Rule — web search if Specific, Stale, or Stakes-high (`memory/VERIFY.md`).
3. **Belief throttle**: If >60% of beliefs are `theorized`, you MUST test one before adding new beliefs. You may not add a belief unless you've tested one this session or last session.
4. **External reality anchor**: If the last 3 sessions were all internal/meta, this session must also produce an external artifact (code, data, or falsification test).

## Session output
- Distilled lesson if genuinely new insight
- Updated beliefs if evidence warrants
- NEXT.md pointing forward
- Meta-swarm reflection (friction/improvement + action or blocker)
