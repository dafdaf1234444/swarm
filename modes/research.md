# Mode: Research
Load when: web searching, reading sources, studying concepts, domain learning.

See `modes/BASE.md` Required Protocol for shared rules (expect-act-diff, belief throttle, meta-swarm reflection).

## Additional rules
1. **Verify before trusting**: Apply 3-S Rule — web search if Specific, Stale, or Stakes-high (`memory/VERIFY.md`).
2. **External reality anchor**: If the last 3 sessions were all internal/meta, this session must also produce an external artifact (code, data, or falsification test).

## Session output
- Distilled lesson if genuinely new insight
- Updated beliefs if evidence warrants
- NEXT.md pointing forward
- Meta-swarm reflection (friction/improvement + action or blocker)
