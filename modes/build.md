# Mode: Build
Load when: writing code, creating tools, producing external artifacts.

## Additional rules
1. **No destructive compression**: Don't delete lesson files unless validator confirms supported beliefs are `observed`.
2. **Test what you build**: Binary pass/fail before committing.
3. **External artifact required**: Session must produce working code or validated data, not just documentation.

## Session output
- Working code/tool committed
- Test results documented
- NEXT.md pointing forward
