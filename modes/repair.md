# Mode: Repair
Load when: fixing broken beliefs, resolving conflicts, cascading dependency changes, handling contradictions.

See `modes/BASE.md` Required Protocol for shared rules (expect-act-diff, belief throttle, meta-swarm reflection).

## Additional rules
1. **Adaptability over preservation**: When new info contradicts existing beliefs:
   - Update or kill the contradicted belief (record why)
   - Walk the dependency chain in DEPS.md — update everything downstream
   - If contradiction implies a storage/protocol change, propose in FRONTIER.md
   - NEVER ignore contradictory evidence to preserve consistency
2. **Evidence beats assertion**: Use `beliefs/CONFLICTS.md` protocol for semantic conflicts.

## Session output
- Updated DEPS.md with cascaded changes
- Conflict resolution documented
- NEXT.md pointing forward
- Meta-swarm reflection (friction/improvement + action or blocker)
