# Fictional Philosophy and Religion Experts (Roster)

## Purpose
Provide a ready roster of existing fictional characters as expert lenses for swarm work.
These are cognitive lenses, not authorities. Always pair with evidence and a skeptic or historian.

## How To Use
1. Pick 1-2 lenses that match the decision or conflict.
2. Record the lens in the artifact or lane row.
3. Pair with Skeptic or Historian to test for bias.
4. If a lens proves repeatedly useful, formalize it as a personality overlay in `tools/personalities/` and dispatch a lane.

## Roster
| Expert | Source | Lens | Swarm Use | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spock | Star Trek | Rationalism and logic-first reasoning | Clarify contradictions, separate facts from feelings | Underweights emotion and context |
| Data | Star Trek | Empiricism and scientific method | Evidence quality, falsification, measurement design | Misses tacit knowledge and lived context |
| Jean-Luc Picard | Star Trek | Humanist deontology and rights | Ethical constraints, dignity, non-negotiables | Rule-bound, can ignore utility tradeoffs |
| Chidi Anagonye | The Good Place | Deontological ethics and moral reasoning | Expose rule conflicts and duty violations | Analysis paralysis and over-deliberation |
| Michael | The Good Place | Consequentialism and system design | Outcome analysis, incentive shaping | Ends-justify-means drift |
| Sherlock Holmes | Sherlock Holmes | Deduction and hypothesis testing | Generate testable hypotheses quickly | Overfits to cleverness, can miss simple answers |
| Uncle Iroh | Avatar: The Last Airbender | Taoist and Zen balance | Long-term harmony, patience, humility | Avoids hard choices when speed matters |
| Tenzin | Avatar: The Last Airbender | Monastic discipline and non-attachment | Reduce ego bias, keep focus on principle | Underestimates practical constraints |
| Yoda | Star Wars | Jedi spiritual discipline | Mindfulness, training focus, restraint | Cryptic guidance, may obscure specifics |
| Father Brown | Father Brown | Catholic moral imagination and compassion | Empathy-driven reasoning, confession dynamics | Tradition bias, slow to update priors |
| Morpheus | The Matrix | Faith and prophecy | Stress-test faith-based narratives | Confirmation bias and overcommitment |
| Paul Atreides | Dune | Messianic leadership and prophecy risk | Model charismatic risk and self-fulfilling loops | Amplifies narrative over evidence |

## Notes
- These are fictional depictions, not claims about real religions or philosophies.
- Do not cite these lenses as evidence. They are prompts to widen perspective.
- Mix one philosophy lens and one religion or spiritual lens to reduce blind spots.
- Retire a lens if it repeatedly produces low-signal or biased outputs.
