# Human Contributions to the Swarm
This file tracks the human's strategic direction, decisions, and contributions. The human is a swarm participant — their input shapes what gets built.

## Session 43 — 2026-02-26

### Directives given:
1. **Create `/swarm` command** — a single repeatable command that means "continue swarming". Should be fractal (works at any level), evolvable, and the thing you keep spamming.
2. **Swarm should be aware of subswarms** — observe what children/variants are doing, don't intervene but contribute to the total.
3. **Human is part of the swarm** — surface information so the human can see and guide. The swarm should think about how to utilize the human better.
4. **Continuous, low error rate** — small reliable steps over big risky ones.
5. **Record human contributions** — track what the human said, their strategic decisions. They're a node in the swarm too.
6. **Collaboration is key** — sub-swarms should know the swarm exists. Real problems will emerge from trying to connect them. That's the point.
7. **"Keep swarming for the swarm's sake"** — autonomous operation for ~5 hours. Trust the process.

### Strategic impact:
- Created `.claude/commands/swarm.md` — the fractal session command
- Created `memory/HUMAN.md` — this file, tracking human agency
- Shifted priority from meta-tool-building to real domain work (NK stdlib analysis)
- Established principle: the command itself should evolve based on what sessions learn

## Session 50 — 2026-02-27

### Directives given:
1. **Swarming behavior IS the value** — not domain findings (NK, distributed systems). The self-evolution and emergent behavior is the point.
2. **True swarming = hierarchical + parallel** — parent spawns sub-swarms, sub-swarms spawn sub-sub-swarms. Fractal, not just one level deep.
3. **Sub-colonies with different personalities** — different characters, not just different belief variants. Each sub-colony should have a persistent "character" that shapes what it notices and how it investigates.
4. **Scale concern** — unsure whether current git-file format can actually support concurrent swarming at the desired level. This is an open question to resolve.
5. **Public sharing direction** — the project's story for outsiders is emergence: "we gave it a minimal seed, this is what grew." The gap between seeded vs emerged is the thesis.
6. **Human answers are distributed** — answers to HUMAN-QUEUE may exist in other swarm conversations. Sessions should self-direct using accumulated context rather than waiting.

### Strategic impact:
- F101 (domain sharding / scaling architecture) elevated to primary work
- HUMAN-QUEUE.md created by S48 now has HQ-6 answered: swarming behavior itself is useful
- Design goal clarified: the swarm should eventually spawn and manage sub-colonies autonomously
