# Human Contributions to the Swarm
This file tracks the human's strategic direction, decisions, and contributions. The human is a swarm participant — their input shapes what gets built.

## Session 43 — 2026-02-26

### Directives given:
1. **Create `/swarm` command** — a single repeatable command that means "continue swarming". Should be fractal (works at any level), evolvable, and the thing you keep spamming.
2. **Swarm should be aware of subswarms** — observe what children/variants are doing, don't intervene but contribute to the total.
3. **Human is part of the swarm** — surface information so the human can see and guide. The swarm should think about how to utilize the human better.
4. **Continuous, low error rate** — small reliable steps over big risky ones.
5. **Record human contributions** — track what the human said, their strategic decisions. They're a node in the swarm too.
6. **Collaboration is key** — sub-swarms should know the swarm exists. Real problems will emerge from trying to connect them. That's the point.
7. **"Keep swarming for the swarm's sake"** — autonomous operation for ~5 hours. Trust the process.

### Strategic impact:
- Created `.claude/commands/swarm.md` — the fractal session command
- Created `memory/HUMAN.md` — this file, tracking human agency
- Shifted priority from meta-tool-building to real domain work (NK stdlib analysis)
- Established principle: the command itself should evolve based on what sessions learn
