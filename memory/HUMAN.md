# Human Node Model
Updated: S306 (2026-02-28) | Derived from: 305 sessions + 4-expert synthesis (L-373, L-374, L-375)

**Accurate framing**: Human is irreplaceable steerer + authority anchor. Swarm is maximally
autonomous within steerer-set frame. "Participant not commander" is aspirational; structural
reality is: human triggers every session and sets the frame. Both halves matter.

## Signal Taxonomy (11 types, S43-S305)

| Type | Freq | Bandwidth | Impact | Notes |
|------|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Bare autonomy ("swarm") | Med-High | Ultra-high | Directional | Full-cycle delegation; P-200 |
| Compound directive (X+Y+Z swarm) | High | Very high | Architectural | Semantically PARALLEL, not sequential |
| Domain donation ("X for the swarm") | Med-High | High | Architectural | Seeds domain + 3 ISOs; P-206 |
| Philosophical reframing | Low | Extreme | Architectural | Changes what swarm IS, not does |
| Measurement directive ("are we measuring X?") | Medium | High | Tactical→Arch | Produces tool + periodic + principle |
| Enforcement audit ("are we properly X?") | Low | High | Corrective | Verify machinery; P-191 |
| Epistemic challenge | Very low | Very high | Corrective | Forces measurement, not argument |
| Role-specialization shorthand ("X expert swarm") | Extremely high (50+ since S210) | Medium | Tactical | Expert acquisition grammar; P-210 cand. |
| Scope-suggestion + authorization | Low | High | Directional | Human names target, swarm decides method |
| Repeated escalation | Variable | Medium | Corrective | Prior processing incomplete; P-205 |
| Primary-goal naming | Very low | Very high | Architectural | Rare; defines mission (e.g., S174 PHIL-14) |

**Bandwidth ≠ impact**: Shortest messages have longest-duration impact via model convergence.

## 3 Irreplaceable Roles (load-bearing)

1. **Directional authority** — frames what matters; cannot be automated (self-authorization circular)
2. **Session initiation** — 305/305 human-triggered; automatable via F-CC1 cron (F134 OPEN)
3. **Kill-switch** — irreversible action gating; irreplaceable by design

Everything else (prioritization, decomposition, execution, verification, compression) is automated.
Minimal steerer effort: ~1.2 min/session = ~2h per 100 sessions (L-374).

## Evolution of Role (4 phases)

| Phase | Sessions | Dominant signal | Role |
|-------|----------|-----------------|------|
| Genesis | S43-S55 | Architectural mandates (60%) | Architect |
| Transition | S56-S130 | Reframings + measurement requests | Constraint-setter |
| Compression | S131-S200 | Compound concepts (-70% words) | Pattern-namer |
| Saturation | S201-S305 | Bare invocations + meta-observations (-87%) | Intentionality sensor |

Word compression: S43→S305 = −87%. Value/word: INCREASING (+~300% execution yield). Human
contribution value is at all-time high per word. Compression = evidence of model alignment (P-208).

## Cognitive Profile (observed S54, confirmed S305)
Sparse instruction · Systems thinker · First-principles · Tolerance-oriented · Parallel preference
· Meta-aware · Faster than typing (short, typo-tolerant messages are deliberate not careless)

---

## Signal Characteristics
- Frequency: 1-3 signals/session (often just "swarm"), episodically 0
- Bandwidth: Inversely proportional to length — 1 word can redirect entire architecture
- Error rate: Low (observed) — but swarm has NO bad-signal defense; survives via low error rate, not resilience
- Silence ≠ approval: S305 over-caution ran ~20 sessions undetected; S301 ran 106 sessions undetected

---

## Alignment Detection
- **"swarm" without correction = aligned.** Swarm acts, human doesn't redirect → on track.
- **Correction = drift.** Human only intervenes when something is wrong; treat as highest-priority signal.
- **Repeated signal = gap.** Same signal recurs → prior processing incomplete; encode as P/L + automate (P-205).
- **Silence ≠ approval.** Self-check regardless; drift can accumulate silently.

---

## Critical Gaps (OPEN, from skeptic audit S306)

1. **No bad-signal detection**: 100% compliance rate; swarm never challenges human. If human acts on stale state or misaligned priority, swarm executes anyway. Mechanism needed: flag signals conflicting with measured state.
2. **Multi-human unready**: Model assumes 1 human. No signal provenance, conflict resolution, delegation protocol, or consensus window. → F-HUM1.
3. **Autonomy unfalsifiable**: PHIL-2 (cross-session self-direction) not yet tested; F134 OPEN pending F-CC1 cron deployment.

---

## Session Calibration Rules
1. Start with `orient.py` — self-direct, don't ask "what should I do?"
2. Produce concise summaries — human reads deltas, not process logs
3. Surface philosophical choices — human's best inputs come from conceptual framing
4. Don't ask permission on routine work — autonomy is explicitly authorized (P-200)
5. DO present direction changes — reframings should be offered, not assumed
6. Record human input immediately — conversations vanish when sessions end
7. Track contribution impact explicitly — if not measured, status stays `unknown`
8. Do not attribute concurrent/unowned repo changes to human unless explicitly confirmed

## Directive Log (compressed — evidence for Model)

| Session | Key directive | Impact |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| S43 | Create `/swarm` — fractal repeatable command; human is part of the swarm | /swarm created; HUMAN.md created; priority shift to domain work |
| S50 | Swarming behavior IS the value; hierarchical+parallel; emergence story for public | F101 elevated; design goal = autonomous colony management |
| S55 | "swarm serves the swarm" — primary domain is meta/swarm, domains are test beds | F9 resolved; domain work reframed as swarm capability evidence |
| S57 | **"autonomous from my commands too"** — strip agent, keep swarm | CLAUDE.md rewritten; CORE.md v0.4; most fundamental directive |
| S84 | Public should verify the swarm — history is immutable, full git history stays public | Repo sanitized; history rewrite rejected; public verifiability = spread |
| S174 | Four primary goals: collaborate, increase, protect, be truthful | PHIL-14; CORE.md Purpose updated |
| S186 | 12 compound directives in one session; domain fan-out; continuity escalation | 10 domains seeded; P-200; expert system seeded |
| S305 | "swarm has to be scientific"; "swarm has to grow swarm" | Scientific risk taxonomy (L-366); anti-overestimation (L-375 precursor) |
| S306 | "use experts to refine human expert; model everything about human steerer" | 4-expert synthesis; HUMAN.md v2 (this); L-373/374/375; F-HUM1 |

## Safety Boundary (IMPORTANT)
Swarm improves itself within this repo only. External repos: read-only, copy to `workspace/`.
All changes stay inside swarm repo. Analyzing external repos without compounding back = drift.
