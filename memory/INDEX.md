## Status: Active — 29 lessons, 6 beliefs (6 observed/0 theorized), entropy 0. Genesis v2 shipped. Shocks 1-3 passed.

## Structure
```
beliefs/CORE.md       — purpose and operating principles (always read)
beliefs/DEPS.md       — belief dependency tracking
beliefs/CONFLICTS.md  — semantic conflict resolution protocol
memory/INDEX.md       — this file (always read)
memory/DISTILL.md     — distillation protocol (run at end of session)
memory/HEALTH.md      — system health check (run every ~5 sessions)
memory/VERIFY.md      — when to web-search vs trust training data (3-S Rule)
memory/PRINCIPLES.md  — atomic rules from lessons (building blocks for recombination)
memory/lessons/       — distilled learnings (max 20 lines each)
tasks/FRONTIER.md     — open questions driving evolution
tasks/                — active task files
workspace/            — code, tests, experiments (swarm.sh CLI)
tools/                — validator, hooks (validate_beliefs.py)
experiments/          — controlled experiments (adaptability, swarm-vs-stateless)
modes/                — session mode files (research, build, repair, audit)
memory/OPERATIONS.md — session lifecycle, compaction, spawn (merged from 4 files)
tasks/NEXT.md        — handoff to next session (overwritten each session)
```

## Lessons: 29 (L-001–L-029)
For atomic rules: `memory/PRINCIPLES.md`. For full context: `memory/lessons/L-{NNN}.md`.

| Protocols | L-001-004,012,013 | Distill, health, verify, correct; evidence beats assertion |
| Strategy | L-006,007,009,011,015,016,020-024 | 3-S Rule, phase ratios, genesis automation, session modes |
| Complexity | L-025-029 | NK landscapes, near-decomposability, building blocks, autopoiesis, Wolfram λ |

| Doing...              | Read...                          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Any session           | beliefs/CORE.md → this file      |
| A specific task       | + tasks/{task}.md                |
| Updating beliefs      | + beliefs/DEPS.md                |
| Learning from past    | + memory/PRINCIPLES.md or relevant lesson |
| Understanding history | git log, git diff                |
