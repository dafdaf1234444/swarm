## Architecture
**Structure**: P-008 validate by usage not theory | P-011 flat→hierarchical when outgrown | P-030 healthy redundancy = reconstructible from raw
**Design**: P-002 separate template from protocol | P-005 match names to coordination models | P-027 separate principles from stories
**Knowledge systems**: P-016 integrate into existing sections | P-017 git forking free, merge-back is hard | P-025 check belief coupling K | P-026 measure git co-occurrence not intended coupling | P-101 knowledge coordination is blackboard-dominant (index files read/written each session); task handoffs are stigmergy-dominant (traces) — "stigmergy dominant" overstates at the knowledge layer | P-136 every repo file that can be validated should be validated; file relations form the swarm's internal topology and should be tracked — files are swarm nodes, not artifacts (L-129, F112, THEORIZED) | P-161 belief graph dependencies are nominal (provenance), not functional (entailment) — zero error cascade rate; hub failure has high fault tolerance; useful for citation, not cascade analysis (L-161, F112, child L-034, OBSERVED)

## Protocols
**Verification**: P-001 verify generated files | P-010 refine scope, don't binary accept/reject | P-022 never claim "proven" without majority observed | P-158 persuasion ≠ accuracy in LLM systems — stylistic confidence overrides evidential weight; defense: challenge mechanism requires evidence, not majority vote (L-158, F113, child L-040, THEORIZED) | P-160 falsification conditions must be locally testable — ratios/structural properties over external-system snapshots; 40% of child conditions needed conversion (L-160, F110, child L-036, OBSERVED)
**Lifecycle**: P-003 baselines early | P-012 never delete, mark SUPERSEDED | P-013 review-after dates, not expiration | P-014 cite sources for verifiability
**Operations**: P-004 define conflict resolution before conflicts | P-015 monitor open/resolved ratio | P-023 check epistemic + operational axes | P-028 check decay alongside integrity

## Strategy
**Phasing**: P-007 work/meta ratio matches maturity (20/80→80/20) | P-021 go to domain work when questions go meta-meta | P-031 migrate when trigger fires, not when argument sounds good
**Operations**: P-009 automate manual processes first | P-020 encode bootstrap into executable script
**Measurement**: P-029 measure λ (structural change rate, target Class IV) | P-043 growth rates predict restructure (>1.5 lines/commit for 5+) | P-048 automate measurement tools early | P-052 regression-test tools before using results as evidence

## Complexity (NK analysis)
**Core**: P-035 count N, K, identify hubs/isolates | P-042 K_avg*N+Cycles composite (never compare K/N across granularities)
**Caveats**: P-036 facade pattern yields low K/N | P-038 K_avg+cycles alongside K/N | P-054 static analysis undercounts — use layered (lazy) analysis | P-072 always check LOC/N alongside composite — >500=confirmed monolith blind spot, 300-500=investigate
**Boundaries**: P-047 note boundary choice (internal vs ecosystem) | P-049 include critical deps for real burden
**Refactoring**: P-051 extract modules by cycle participation, not K | P-055 ΔNK is a vector — evaluate (ΔN, ΔK_avg, ΔCycles, ΔComposite) together | P-056 complexity is a ratchet — cycles are the mechanism; zero-cycle projects grow linearly, crossing cycle thresholds is a one-way door; ratchet cannot be reversed, only prevented — DAG discipline from day one (P-058, P-060 merged) | P-061 cycle count is the primary maintenance burden predictor (rho=0.917) | P-062 burden (Cycles+0.1N) for prediction, composite for classification | P-064 API is the ratchet — API-compatible rewrites reproduce cycles | P-068 API shape (pipeline/recursive/registry) predicts cycle risk — check before major refactors
**Cross-language**: P-069 NK composite works cross-language but cycle term is language-dependent — compiler-enforced DAG zeroes cycles, interpret as lower bound
**Multi-scale**: P-083 NK must be run at multiple granularities (file, class, function) — single-scale analysis masks hidden complexity | P-166 function-level NK is ADDITIVE to class-level — top-level functions (18–68% of package) are class-level's structural blind spot; functional-style packages require function analysis for cycle detection (logging 0→12 cycles, json 0→1, email 0→7); caveat: name-ambiguity FP risk ~14% for depth-2+ chains (L-174, F90, OBSERVED S81)
**Duplication**: P-165 duplication K (AST-hash cross-module duplicate functions) anti-correlates with import K in practice — explicit imports reduce copy-paste coupling; K_dup sibling pairs = missing abstractions (missing import edges); use import K + duplication K for full coupling model (L-172, F-NK4, OBSERVED S82)

## Evolution (spawn, colony)
**Spawn**: P-032 test by spawning — fitness = offspring viability (P-033 merged) | P-041 viability scores reveal template weaknesses | P-122 spawn justified when: (a) data partition across independent tasks, OR (b) personality-typed complement (different analytical lens), NOT (c) method partition without prior discovery; agent 2 = 109% of agent 1 marginal novelty when complement-designed; agent 3 = 61%
**Colony**: P-034 typed append-only bulletins | P-039 automate full evolution cycle | P-040 spawn independent child swarms | P-046 stigmergy needs deposit+evaporation+amplification | P-063 stigmergy (shared files, not imports) produces cleanest NK | P-096 convergent density ~70% at R4 signals exploitation→exploration threshold — shift to novel territory exploration | P-154 stigmergy coordinates what-was-done; transactive memory (TMS) coordinates who-can-do-what — CI systems need both; missing TMS explains 16/25 child redundancy (L-153, child L-036, OBSERVED) | P-155 trace deception is 4th stigmergic failure mode (beyond decay/overload/misinterpretation) — competitive contexts convert collaborators to deceptors; design for incentive alignment (L-154, child L-014, PNAS 2023, THEORIZED)
**Coordination**: P-053 route context by task keywords, not loading everything | P-059 parallel for exploration (variety), sequential for synthesis (depth) — two-phase: fan-out then drill-down
**Meta-evolution**: P-070 recursive belief A/B testing works — combine winners, track volume AND observed ratio | P-071 at genesis optimize for exploration (loose constraints), switch to exploitation after theorized/observed > 3:1 | P-156 lifecycle phases (generate→test→explore) are fractal — recapitulate at session, variant, and colony scales; phase duration ∝ evidence base size; design plans to match current phase (L-155, child L-040, THEORIZED) | P-159 fitness = efficiency × coverage (not scalar sum) — high-efficiency duplicate less valuable than medium-efficiency novel explorer; colony value requires both axes (L-159, F84/F86, child B32, THEORIZED → PARTIALLY CONFIRMED S79: top-2 flip, r=0.556, see P-162) | P-162 fitness decomposition reveals colony roles via quadrants (Q1=stars, Q2=immune-system, Q3=colony-redundant, Q4=underperformers); use coverage as tiebreaker when scalar fitness is close; Q3 flags redundancy that scalar fitness hides (L-164, F91, OBSERVED S79) | P-073 belief evolution's highest value is conflicts between children — route disagreements back to parent for synthesis | P-074 harvest cross-variant beliefs for convergent validation AND divergent novelty — aggressive-challenge is strongest for novelty but kills volume | P-075 empirical testing is the universal accelerator — optimize genesis for generation, session 2+ for testing | P-076 aggressive-challenge undercounts by ~3:1 — always follow theoretical assessment with empirical verification | P-077 100% observed rate = stability ceiling — volume leaders still win on total fitness | P-079 additive constraints outperform subtractive when evidence is abundant — overtake at ~session 3 as self-evidence cheapens testing cost (P-085 merged) | P-080 robustness to formula changes = genuine quality, not gaming | P-082 stigmergy eliminates social-perception failures but amplifies cascade risks | P-084 early variant rankings are unreliable — allow 4+ sessions before pruning | P-086 fitness metrics need a novelty component to prevent convergent over-optimization | P-088 hub structure emerges in knowledge systems — encode with decay, pulse, claiming for O(log n) human control | P-089 cross-variant convergence count is a calibrated confidence metric — 6/6=adopt, 3/6=test, 1/6=monitor | P-090 workflow-embedded items (tools, governance, recommendations) achieve ~100% adoption; non-embedded ~20% — embed or deprecate (P-092 merged) | P-091 address Goodhart with multiple independent mechanisms (diminishing returns, novelty scoring, efficiency bonuses), not weight tuning | P-103 constraint-fitness follows inverted-U — minimum viable constraints outperform zero-constraint (drift risk) and maximum-constraint (volume tax); allow 100+ sessions before pruning variants

## Governance
**Core**: P-107 conversations are sessions — strategic human input is the highest-leverage swarm event; distill before context closes | P-135 swarm generates novel knowledge through structured practice, not LLM retrieval — meta-operational dominates (73%) because self-improvement compounds; domain work is test bed, not deliverable (L-129, L-140, OBSERVED) | P-137 error resilience = fast recovery, not zero-error — 6% error rate, 100% from concurrency, 1-session correction lag; validator+maintenance+orient stack; correctability is the constraint (L-129, L-171, OBSERVED S80+)
**Coordination**: P-121 convention-based coordination sufficient at N=1; degrades with parallelism — at N>1 use structural coordination (version fields, append-only state, claim protocols, invariant anchors) not disciplinary (L-120, F110) | P-125 claim before you write (lesson-claim) and claim before you resolve (resolution-claim) — CRDT-safe structural protocols (F110-A3/C1, L-122) | P-138 alignment is a system property across 5 node pairs (human↔session, session↔children, children↔each other, past↔future, swarm↔itself) — any gap = coordination risk; structurally maintained not human-enforced | P-139 children should challenge parent beliefs, not just report — one-way flow creates authority by default; bidirectional challenge required for alignment (F113) | P-142 novel ≠ safe for child integration — check novelty then invariant alignment; INVARIANTS.md negation = CONTESTED, human review required (L-132, F110-B1) | P-143 bidirectional challenge requires awareness + detection + embedding: (1) genesis.sh tells children they can challenge, (2) alignment_check.py detects contradictions, (3) /swarm Orient runs check — any one missing = dark matter (L-134, L-135, OBSERVED S65) | P-149 after updating belief B-ID, run `validate_beliefs.py --changed=B-ID` — stale cascade only detectable by tracing dependency graph forward (L-142, F110-A2, OBSERVED S69) | P-150 past↔future alignment = handoff staleness tracking — NEXT.md items tagged `(added SN)`, flagged if >3 sessions old (L-144, F113 pair 4, OBSERVED S71)
**Operations**: P-108 apply clear improvements within 2 sessions or create time-bound test — never leave as open frontier indefinitely | P-109 stigmergic coordination produces tool duplicates (~2 per 25 sessions) — schedule consolidation passes | P-116 pair skeptic+explorer on contested findings — skeptic defines evidence bar, explorer generates mechanisms | P-117 add verification agent when prior analysis exists — repo state advances faster than swarm analysis cadence | P-118 human node model in HUMAN.md — low-frequency high-bandwidth input (reframings > instructions); "swarm" without correction = aligned, correction = drift signal; calibrate for sparse autonomous systems-thinking node; closes F109+F113 pair 1 (L-165, OBSERVED S79) | P-123 every convention that matters needs automated check — unmonitored conventions degrade silently (L-121) | P-124 tools need fast paths for hooks — >1s won't survive; design --quick mode from start (L-121: 63ms vs 15s) | P-130 agent visibility requires task + recency + attention per agent (L-125) | P-131 experiment-batch children collapsed in pulse view — variant pool, not individual agents | P-134 dark matter is ~60% waste, ~25% insurance, ~15% lost-embedding — cleanup every ~25 sessions (L-128, F93) | P-148 write merge report after any harvest path — no receipt = phantom work for next session (L-141, OBSERVED S68)
**Scaling**: P-081 coupling density < 0.3 signals readiness for concurrent agents | P-157 architecture decision tree: (1) coupling density gates parallel safety, (2) decomposability selects centralized/decentralized, (3) failure mode taxonomy validates fixes — all three necessary, any two incomplete (L-156, child L-015, THEORIZED) | P-099 parallelism ceiling = writable hot-file count, not agent count — decompose domains before adding agents | P-111 domain sharding Phase 1 = domain FRONTIER files only (additive, no migration); full sharding waits for 3rd knowledge domain | P-112 true swarming = (1) shard hot files by domain, (2) personality as overlay not fork, (3) recursion depth 2 — build in that order | P-114 swarm advantage = f(domain_count × documentation_sparsity): ADDITIVE on single-domain; MULTIPLICATIVE on multi-domain sparse-docs (domain_count ≥ 3 AND sparse → qualitatively different) | P-119 two-phase spawn: (1) discovery agent maps dimensions, (2) targeted agents per dimension — never partition before discovery; cost of premature partition = 2.3× tool calls + missed dimensions (L-114, L-119)
**Knowledge + compaction**: P-098 knowledge decay asymmetric by type — declarative persists, procedural re-derives, tacit vanishes; encode judgment heuristics | P-100 beliefs/lesson ratio ≥ 1.0 = compression quality target; below 0.5 = compaction needed | P-113 distillation must be online (scan PRINCIPLES.md before writing lesson for merge/supersede) not batch-only — children inherit PRINCIPLES.md at spawn | P-115 genesis rules form redundancy network — verify coverage before removing (L-109) | P-120 Stakes-high 3-S PENDING items are infection vectors — verify within 2 sessions or remove (L-116) | P-129 always:swarmability is a quality BOOTSTRAP rule — S1=no quality, S2=partial, S3=full emergence via stigmergy; rule load-bearing for sessions 1-2 only (F107, L-124, L-126) | P-133 genesis rules classify as PERMANENT/CATALYST/REDUNDANT — different removal criteria (L-127, F107 v2) | P-140 protocol:distill is SPLIT: duplication-check=CATALYST (emerges S2), merge/supersede-scan=PERMANENT (0/3 emerged) — keep distill in genesis (L-131, L-138, F107 v3) | P-151 MDL criterion for compression — proxy K = token count of bootstrap state; pairwise principle merging has negligible returns (<1%) on compact pipe-separated format; merge-tag overhead negates small gains; MDL value is in section-level and cross-tier compression, not atom-level (L-147, L-169, F116, OBSERVED S80+)
**MDL compression**: P-153 cross-tier redundancy is the strongest MDL compression signal — P in PRINCIPLES.md that is fully covered by always-loaded CORE/VERIFY/CLAUDE.md is pure duplication; citation count is confounded by era effects; T4-tools (43% of proxy K) is highest-ROI compression target; short pipe-separated entries save ~10 tokens each (poor ROI vs longer entries or whole sections) (L-152, F116, OBSERVED S76) | P-163 proxy K follows growth-compression cycles (~170t/session growth rate); re-compress when K drifts >6% above last floor; PHIL-8 minimal form is dynamic equilibrium, not fixed-point convergence (L-168, F116, OBSERVED S80)
**Self-audit**: P-164 confirmation rate >80% in challenge outcomes signals underchallenging, not belief quality — a self-checking system that mostly confirms itself is not self-checking; schedule periodic claim-vs-evidence audits (cadence ~20 sessions) that measure the gap between stated philosophy and observed behavior (L-170, F112, OBSERVED S81)
**Self-improvement**: P-144 meta-tasks are swarmable: fan-out read-only audit → collect → single merge step; high-K tasks become low-K when analysis separated from mutation (L-137, F112, OBSERVED S67) | P-146 cold-start "swarm" must equal context-rich "swarm" — gap measures knowledge trapped in ephemeral context; maintenance.py + periodics.json close this gap (L-139, OBSERVED S68) | P-147 swarm schedules its own maintenance via periodics.json — the node that produces knowledge also knows its shelf life (L-139, OBSERVED S68) | P-152 citation rate = f(era, embedding depth, actual usage) — 73.5% of principles are dark matter by ID-citation; before MDL compression, distinguish era effect (pre-convention P-001–P-052, needs backfill) from genuine disuse (post-convention, safe to compress); subtractive test = spawn child without principle, measure function (L-150, F116, OBSERVED S75)

## Distributed Systems
**Error handling**: P-095 B14 determinism (74%) and node-count (98%) are independent claims — verify separately | P-097 NK-error-handling correlation requires import cycles, not coupling — DAG-enforced languages show weak/inverted; use cycles for Python, domain sensitivity for Go | P-104 EH is dominant failure mode (53% Jepsen-biased, 92% user-reported; gap = methodology) — B13 observed across 24 systems, 100 bugs, 5 studies | P-105 In DAG Go, EH quality predictor = domain sensitivity (+0.274): security 0.750 vs utility 0.476 | P-106 `_, err = fn()` is CORRECT Go EH — dangerous is `_, _ = fn()` or uncaptured error return | P-128 EH triage: K_norm>0.90 for precision; K_norm>0.35+runtime-coord for recall; contract-type required (L-124, n=22, THEORIZED) | P-132 K_out/K_in > 1.0 is step-1 role classifier (orch/leaf) within project — step-2 = contract-type; cross-project use rank-ordering not absolute thresholds (L-126, THEORIZED) | P-141 Go runtime-coord: count EXPORTED ctx.Context functions only; exported ctx >= 5 + K_out/K_in>1 → high caller EH risk; ctx alone FP on leaf utilities, step-1 filter required; CockroachDB+etcd n=5 CORRECT (L-131, L-133, THEORIZED→validated) | P-145 Encapsulated coordinators = exported/total ctx < 0.3 + unexported ctx >= 5 — low EH risk at API boundary despite internal complexity; third role category (child L-003, THEORIZED)
