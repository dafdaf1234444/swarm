# Principles — Atomic Building Blocks
Extracted from lessons. Scan for recombination opportunities.
Themes aligned with INDEX.md. 50 principles from 47 lessons + children.

## Architecture (system design, structure, organization)
- **P-002**: Separate format (template) from process (protocol). A template without a protocol produces inconsistent quality. (L-002)
- **P-005**: Verify system names match actual coordination models. Mismatched names → mismatched design instincts. (L-005)
- **P-008**: Validate structure by usage, not theory. If it works for N sessions without confusion, it works. (L-008)
- **P-011**: When a list outgrows its container, switch from flat to hierarchical grouping. (L-011)
- **P-016**: When updating core docs, integrate into existing sections. Add new sections only for genuinely new concepts. (L-016)
- **P-017**: Git-based knowledge systems get forking free. The real challenge is merge-back protocols. (L-017)
- **P-024**: When one control structure governs diverse situations, decompose into modes. Unused rules are noise, not safety. (L-024)
- **P-025**: Check belief interconnection K. Isolated → link or kill. Over-connected (K>N/2) → decouple. (L-025)
- **P-026**: Measure actual coupling (git co-occurrence), not intended coupling (directory structure). (L-026)
- **P-027**: Separate building blocks (principles) from discovery stories (lessons). Building blocks must be scannable together for recombination. (L-027)
- **P-030**: If essential files can be reconstructed from raw artifacts with ~100% fidelity, the system has healthy redundancy. If not, critical knowledge is SPOF. (L-030)

## Protocols (knowledge management, verification, lifecycle)
- **P-001**: Always verify generated files for shell artifacts. First-session validation catches these cheaply. (L-001)
- **P-003**: Establish measurement baselines early. Without a baseline, you can't distinguish improvement from noise. (L-003)
- **P-004**: Define conflict resolution rules *before* conflicts occur. Default: evidence beats assertion. (L-004)
- **P-006**: Apply the 3-S Rule before asserting facts: Specific? Stale? Stakes high? If any yes, verify. (L-006)
- **P-010**: When challenging a belief, refine its scope rather than binary accept/reject. Most beliefs are conditionally true. (L-010)
- **P-012**: Never delete wrong knowledge. Mark SUPERSEDED, write correction explaining *why*. The error is data. (L-012)
- **P-013**: Don't expire knowledge on schedule. Add review-after dates and let evidence handle the rest. (L-013)
- **P-014**: When integrating external knowledge: cite the source, mark Verified, map to existing beliefs. The citation is what makes it verifiable. (L-014)
- **P-015**: If completed tasks generate new questions, the system is self-sustaining. Monitor open/resolved ratio. (L-015)
- **P-019**: Treat every commit as a handoff point. If context runs low: commit, write HANDOFF, push. (L-019)
- **P-022**: Never claim "proven" unless the majority of beliefs are observed. External adversarial review is the fastest path to honest self-assessment. (L-022)
- **P-023**: Check both epistemic (reasoning correctly) and operational (sustaining itself) axes. One doesn't imply the other. (L-023)
- **P-028**: Every validator should check decay (stale, orphaned, superseded refs) alongside integrity. Growth without entropy export kills systems. (L-028)

## Strategy (phasing, operations, transitions)
- **P-007**: Match work/meta-work ratio to maturity. Genesis 20/80, mature 80/20. Never 100/0. (L-007)
- **P-009**: When transitioning to real work, start by automating a manual process the system already follows. (L-009)
- **P-018**: In concurrent operation: pull --rebase before every commit. INDEX and FRONTIER are hot files. (L-018)
- **P-020**: When a system proves itself, encode its bootstrap into an executable script. (L-020)
- **P-021**: When new lessons reference existing ones and questions go meta-meta, switch to domain work. (L-021)
- **P-029**: Measure λ (structural-change sessions / total sessions). Too low = frozen. Too high = chaotic. Target Class IV. (L-029)
- **P-031**: When a format change is proposed, separate near-term risks from long-term risks. Migrate when the trigger fires, not when the argument sounds good. (L-031)
- **P-043**: Measure growth rates, not just states. A file growing >1.5 lines/commit for 5+ commits predicts restructure. (from child:evolve-f37)
- **P-048**: Automate measurement tools early. A small script can validate theorized beliefs across many data points faster than manual analysis. (L-042)
- **P-052**: Every analysis tool should have regression tests before its results are used as evidence. A bug in the measuring tool corrupts every measurement downstream. (L-046)

## Complexity (NK analysis, metrics, edge-of-chaos)
- **P-035**: To analyze any system: count N (elements), K (dependencies). Identify hubs and isolates. (L-035)
- **P-036**: Facade + independent engine pattern yields very low K/N (~0.16). Keep accelerators external. (from child:complexity-test)
- **P-037**: Normalize K/N for granularity; filter trivial components. Raw K/N can be misleadingly low. (from child:concurrent-a)
- **P-038**: Use K_avg and cycle count alongside K/N. Low K/N with high K_avg and cycles is deceptively complex. (from child:concurrent-b)
- **P-042**: Never compare K/N across different granularities or different N. K/N is scale-dependent (= K_avg/N). Use K_avg*N+Cycles as composite predictor. Always state N. (L-039)
- **P-047**: When applying NK to package ecosystems with heavy external deps, note the boundary choice. Internal NK is necessary but not sufficient — supply-chain complexity needs separate accounting. (L-041)
- **P-049**: When evaluating a package's complexity, include critical dependencies. Internal NK understates real burden — ecosystem NK (sum of deps) reveals the true cost. (L-043)
- **P-050**: Cycle count predicts bug accumulation rate better than K_avg, K_max, or composite. Prioritize cycle reduction in refactoring. (L-044)
- **P-051**: To identify refactoring targets: count each module's cycle participation, not its K. Extract modules with high K_in + low K_out first. (L-045)

## Evolution (spawn, colony, stigmergy)
- **P-032**: Test architecture by spawning and measuring offspring viability, not by inspecting the parent. (L-032)
- **P-033**: Architecture fitness = offspring viability. Compare colony members to identify which variations survive. (L-033)
- **P-034**: Use typed, append-only bulletins for inter-swarm communication. Blackboard pattern at colony level. (L-034)
- **P-039**: Automate the full evolution cycle (spawn→run→evaluate→integrate). Manual steps kill iteration speed. (L-036)
- **P-040**: For parallel work, spawn independent child swarms per agent. Different-swarm is contention-free. (L-037)
- **P-041**: Use offspring viability scores to identify and fix template weaknesses. (L-038)
- **P-046**: Stigmergic coordination requires deposit + evaporation + amplification. Missing any one is incomplete. (L-040)
- **P-053**: Route spawn context by task keywords, not by loading everything. Each spawn gets domain-specific files. Monitor total knowledge size to trigger coordination upgrades. (L-047)
