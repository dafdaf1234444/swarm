# Principles — Atomic Building Blocks
Extracted from lessons. Scan for recombination opportunities.
Two rules that address the same situation from different angles may combine into a stronger rule.

## Verification & Honesty
- **P-003**: Establish measurement baselines early. Without a baseline, you can't distinguish improvement from noise. (L-003)
- **P-006**: Apply the 3-S Rule before asserting facts: Specific? Stale? Stakes high? If any yes, verify. (L-006)
- **P-010**: When challenging a belief, refine its scope rather than binary accept/reject. Most beliefs are conditionally true. (L-010)
- **P-014**: When integrating external knowledge: cite the source, mark Verified, map to existing beliefs. The citation is what makes it verifiable. (L-014)
- **P-022**: Never claim "proven" unless the majority of beliefs are observed. External adversarial review is the fastest path to honest self-assessment. (L-022)

## Structure & Organization
- **P-002**: Separate format (template) from process (protocol). A template without a protocol produces inconsistent quality. (L-002)
- **P-008**: Validate structure by usage, not theory. If it works for N sessions without confusion, it works. (L-008)
- **P-011**: When a list outgrows its container, switch from flat to hierarchical grouping. (L-011)
- **P-016**: When updating core docs, integrate into existing sections. Add new sections only for genuinely new concepts. (L-016)
- **P-024**: When one control structure governs diverse situations, decompose into modes. Unused rules are noise, not safety. (L-024)

## Knowledge Lifecycle
- **P-012**: Never delete wrong knowledge. Mark SUPERSEDED, write correction explaining *why*. The error is data. (L-012)
- **P-013**: Don't expire knowledge on schedule. Add review-after dates and let evidence handle the rest. (L-013)
- **P-015**: If completed tasks generate new questions, the system is self-sustaining. Monitor open/resolved ratio. (L-015)
- **P-021**: When new lessons reference existing ones and questions go meta-meta, switch to domain work. (L-021)

## System Architecture
- **P-005**: Verify system names match actual coordination models. Mismatched names → mismatched design instincts. (L-005)
- **P-017**: Git-based knowledge systems get forking free. The real challenge is merge-back protocols. (L-017)
- **P-025**: Check belief interconnection K. Isolated → link or kill. Over-connected (K>N/2) → decouple. (L-025)
- **P-026**: Measure actual coupling (git co-occurrence), not intended coupling (directory structure). (L-026)
- **P-027**: Separate building blocks (principles) from discovery stories (lessons). Building blocks must be scannable together for recombination. (L-027)
- **P-028**: Every validator should check decay (stale, orphaned, superseded refs) alongside integrity. Growth without entropy export kills systems. (L-028)
- **P-029**: Measure λ (structural-change sessions / total sessions). Too low = frozen (Class I/II). Too high = chaotic (Class III). Target Class IV: enough change to adapt, enough routine to produce. (L-029)
- **P-030**: If essential files can be reconstructed from raw artifacts with ~100% fidelity, the system has healthy redundancy. If not, critical knowledge is SPOF. (L-030)
- **P-031**: When a format change is proposed, separate near-term risks (fix cheaply) from long-term risks (set a trigger). Migrate when the trigger fires, not when the argument sounds good. (L-031)

## Operations
- **P-001**: Always verify generated files for shell artifacts. First-session validation catches these cheaply. (L-001)
- **P-004**: Define conflict resolution rules *before* conflicts occur. Default: evidence beats assertion. (L-004)
- **P-007**: Match work/meta-work ratio to maturity. Genesis 20/80, mature 80/20. Never 100/0. (L-007)
- **P-009**: When transitioning to real work, start by automating a manual process the system already follows. (L-009)
- **P-018**: In concurrent operation: pull --rebase before every commit. INDEX and FRONTIER are hot files. (L-018)
- **P-019**: Treat every commit as a handoff point. If context runs low: commit, write HANDOFF, push. (L-019)
- **P-020**: When a system proves itself, encode its bootstrap into an executable script. (L-020)
- **P-023**: Check both epistemic (reasoning correctly) and operational (sustaining itself) axes. One doesn't imply the other. (L-023)
