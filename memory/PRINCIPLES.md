## Architecture
**Structure**: P-008 validate by usage not theory | P-011 flat→hierarchical when outgrown | P-030 healthy redundancy = reconstructible from raw
**Design**: P-002 separate template from protocol | P-005 match names to coordination models | P-027 separate principles from stories
**Knowledge systems**: P-016 integrate into existing sections | P-017 git forking free, merge-back is hard | P-025 check belief coupling K | P-026 measure git co-occurrence not intended coupling | P-101 knowledge coordination is blackboard-dominant; task handoffs are stigmergy-dominant | P-136 files are swarm nodes — validate file relations as internal topology (L-129, OBSERVED) | P-161 belief graph dependencies are nominal (provenance), not functional (entailment) — useful for citation, not cascade analysis (L-161, OBSERVED)

## Protocols
**Verification**: P-001 verify generated files | P-010 refine scope, don't binary accept/reject | P-022 never claim "proven" without majority observed | P-158 persuasion ≠ accuracy: stylistic confidence overrides evidential weight; verbosity 90-120w optimal; defense requires evidence not votes (L-158, PARTIALLY OBSERVED) | P-160 falsification must be locally testable — ratios over external snapshots; founding cohort decays 40% vs 0% — audit founding beliefs first (L-160, OBSERVED)
**Lifecycle**: P-003 baselines early | P-012 SUBSUMED→CORE.9 S341 | P-013 review-after dates, not expiration | P-014 SUBSUMED→CORE.6 S341
**Operations**: P-004 define conflict resolution before conflicts | P-015 monitor open/resolved ratio | P-023 check epistemic + operational axes (operational: integrity + decay) | P-177 foreign-repo entry: detect substrate → read entry files → orient → contribute; blind entry wastes tokens (L-213, F120, OBSERVED) | P-184 external validation upgrades confidence: independent confirmation → upgrade to observed; external gap → open test frontier (L-227, OBSERVED)

## Strategy
**Phasing**: P-007 phase budgeting follows maturity (startup meta-heavy → mature work-heavy) | P-021 meta-recursion exit trigger: switch to domain work when questions become meta-meta | P-031 migrate when trigger fires, not when argument sounds good
**Operations**: P-009 automate manual processes first | P-020 encode bootstrap into executable script
**Measurement**: P-029 measure λ (structural change rate, target Class IV) | P-043 growth rates predict restructure (>1.5 lines/commit for 5+) | P-052 regression-test tools before using results as evidence

## Complexity (NK analysis)
**Core**: P-035 count N, K, identify hubs/isolates | P-042 K_avg*N+Cycles composite; compare alongside K/N (same granularity only) (P-038 merged)
**Caveats**: P-036 facade pattern yields low K/N | P-054 static analysis undercounts — use layered (lazy) analysis | P-072 always check LOC/N alongside composite — >500=confirmed monolith blind spot, 300-500=investigate
**Boundaries**: P-047 note boundary choice (internal vs ecosystem) | P-049 include critical deps for real burden
**Refactoring**: P-051 extract modules by cycle participation, not K | P-055 ΔNK is a vector — evaluate (ΔN, ΔK_avg, ΔCycles, ΔComposite) together | P-056 complexity ratchet: cycles are mechanism; zero-cycle = linear, crossing thresholds = one-way; DAG discipline from day one (P-058, P-060 merged) | P-061 cycle count = primary maintenance burden predictor (rho=0.917) | P-062 burden (Cycles+0.1N) for prediction, composite for classification | P-064 API is the ratchet — compatible rewrites reproduce cycles | P-068 API shape (pipeline/recursive/registry) predicts cycle risk
**Cross-language**: P-069 NK composite works cross-language but cycle term is language-dependent — compiler-enforced DAG zeroes cycles, interpret as lower bound
**Multi-scale**: P-083 NK at multiple granularities (file, class, function) — single-scale masks complexity | P-166 function-level NK ADDITIVE to class-level — top-level functions (18–68%) are blind spot; required for functional package cycle detection; ~14% FP depth-2+ (L-174, OBSERVED)
**Duplication**: P-165 K_dup predicts maturity not import coupling — K_dup≈0 published, >0 scripts = reviewless coupling; within-module = missing base class (L-172, OBSERVED) | P-167 lib production = script→module→export→test; test forces API clarity; concurrent convergence = coordination signal (L-177, OBSERVED)

## Evolution (spawn, colony)
**Spawn**: P-032 test by spawning — fitness = offspring viability (P-033 merged) | P-041 viability scores reveal template weaknesses
**Colony**: P-034 typed append-only bulletins | P-039 automate full evolution cycle | P-046 stigmergy needs deposit+evaporation+amplification — evaporation = attention reallocation not deletion; trigger on routing-file size not time (P-039/P-040, OBSERVED) | P-063 stigmergy (shared files, not imports) = cleanest NK | P-096 convergent density ~70% at R4 = exploitation→exploration threshold | P-154 stigmergy=what-was-done, TMS=who-can-do-what — CI needs both; missing TMS → 64% redundancy; info surfacing > argumentation (50pt gap) (L-153, L-220, OBSERVED) | P-171 maturation co-produces reduced coordination cost AND increased transfer value — both from domain accumulation (P-043, OBSERVED) | P-172 cross-variant convergence = natural BFT — N variants exponentially more reliable; 85.7% faulty tolerance via confidence-weighted consensus; ~14% adversarial optimal (L-016, OBSERVED)
**Coordination**: P-053 route context by task keywords, not loading everything (L-047, OBSERVED) | P-059 parallel for exploration, sequential for synthesis — fan-out then drill-down; specialist parallel ~35% more findings (F76, L-191, OBSERVED) | P-196 portfolio variance is metric-specific: accuracy follows 1/N; wall time INCREASES with N (tail-latency); speedup ≠ accuracy (L-251, L-253, F-FIN1, OBSERVED) | P-198 two error regimes: systematic (wrong belief) → fix source; idiosyncratic (hallucination) → majority vote; belief hygiene > increasing N (L-259, L-260, F-FIN2, OBSERVED) | P-207 domain expert coverage invariant: active frontier → ≥1 DOMEX lane; enforce via maintenance.py; 16/37 unserved pre-enforcement (L-349, S302, OBSERVED)
**Meta-evolution**: P-070 recursive belief A/B testing — combine winners, track volume AND observed ratio | P-071 SUBSUMED→P-067 S341 | P-067 genesis = loose constraints, tighten as beliefs accumulate; loose→tight optimal lifecycle (L-061, OBSERVED) | P-078 complementary traits 2.5x synergy; opposing moderate; redundant slow (L-072, OBSERVED) | P-085 additive variants overtake subtractive at ~session 3 (L-079, OBSERVED) | P-156 lifecycle phases probabilistic not fractal — 1:1:5 variant scale; colony never exits generate (L-155, L-182, PARTIALLY OBSERVED) | P-159 fitness decomposition: Q1-stars/Q2-immune/Q3-redundant/Q4-underperformers (L-164, OBSERVED) | P-073 child conflicts = highest-value → route to parent | P-074 harvest for convergent validation AND divergent novelty | P-075 SUBSUMED→CORE.3+P-052 S341 | P-076 aggressive-challenge undercounts ~3:1 | P-077 100% observed = stability ceiling — observed_rate = production-readiness gate, not fitness comparator; separate quality from productivity scoreboards (L-071, OBSERVED) | P-080 robustness to formula = genuine quality | P-082 stigmergy reduces social-perception failures; 4 modes: decay/overload/misinterpretation/trace-deception; cascade defense: asynchrony preserves independent reads; info surfacing 30.1→80.7% (L-154, L-218, L-220, OBSERVED) | P-183 git-async protects against anchoring but not commit-propagation cascades; break via challenge-recent-commits (L-228, F-AI4, THEORIZED) | P-084 early rankings unreliable — 4+ sessions; organic self-organization sufficient, imposed structure accelerates not determines (P-193 merged, L-078, OBSERVED) | P-086 SUBSUMED→P-074 S341 | P-089 convergence: 6/6=adopt, 3/6=test, 1/6=monitor — same-LLM 6/6=test; cross-substrate=adopt (L-192, OBSERVED) | P-090 workflow-embedded ~100%, non-embedded ~20% — embed or deprecate | P-091 Goodhart: independent mechanisms not weight tuning (L-042, OBSERVED) | P-103 constraint-fitness inverted-U — minimum viable; prune after 100+ sessions

## Governance
**Core**: P-107 SUBSUMED→CORE.7 S341 | P-135 novel knowledge through structured practice, not retrieval — meta-operational (73%) compounds; domain = test bed (L-140, OBSERVED) | P-137 error resilience = fast recovery, not zero-error — 6% rate, 1-session correction lag (L-171, OBSERVED)
**Coordination**: P-121 conventions at N=1; N>1 requires structural protocols (version fields, append-only, claims, invariants) (L-120) | P-125 claim-before-write + claim-before-resolve — CRDT-safe (L-122) | P-138 alignment spans 5 node pairs — structural not human-enforced | P-139 children must challenge parent beliefs (F113) | P-142 novel ≠ safe — check novelty then invariant alignment; negation = CONTESTED (L-132) | P-143 bidirectional challenge = awareness + detection + embedding — any missing = dark matter (L-135, OBSERVED) | P-149 after updating B-ID, run `validate_beliefs.py --changed=B-ID` (L-142, OBSERVED) | P-150 handoff staleness: NEXT.md items tagged `(added SN)`, flag if >3 sessions old (L-144, OBSERVED)
**Operations**: P-108 apply improvements within 2 sessions or time-bound | P-189 never `git add -A` or `git add .` — WSL corruption stages deletions; always add named files (L-234, THEORIZED) | P-109 tool-duplication (~2/25 sessions) = consolidation debt signal | P-116 SUBSUMED→P-210 S341 | P-117 SUBSUMED→P-210 S341 | P-118 human = sparse systems-thinking node — reframings > instructions (L-165, OBSERVED) | P-124 tools need --quick from start | P-130 agent visibility = task + recency + attention; collapse untasked batches into variant pools (L-125, OBSERVED; P-131 merged) | P-134 dark matter ~60/25/15% waste/insurance/lost — prioritize waste slice | P-148 write merge report after harvest (L-141, OBSERVED)
**Scaling**: P-081 coupling density < 0.3 = concurrent-safe | P-157 architecture decision tree: coupling→decomposability→failure taxonomy; cycles disambiguate (L-156, L-184, PARTIALLY OBSERVED) | P-099 parallelism ceiling = writable hot-file count | P-111 domain sharding Phase 1 = domain FRONTIERs only; full at 3rd domain | P-112 true swarming: shard hot files → personality → recursion depth 2 | P-114 swarm advantage = f(domains × doc_sparsity): additive single, multiplicative multi (≥3+sparse) | P-190 task clarity = spawn friction gate: decompose structurally before spawning; overhead dominated by ambiguity not agent count; premature partition = 2.3x cost (L-060, OBSERVED) | P-119 spawn discipline: discovery→targeted; sequential >45% baseline → single-agent+CoT; spawn only when parallelizable (L-119, OBSERVED) | P-169 multi-tool entry = standalone per-tool files; core protocol (md+git) universal (L-187, F118, OBSERVED) | P-174 substrate-scope contamination: runtime facts are host-specific; without `[scope: host]`, portable-by-default encodes false constraints (L-212, OBSERVED)
**Knowledge + compaction**: P-173 CRDTs and pheromones = same primitive (monotonic convergence); 5-10% semantic conflicts need cascade-breaking (L-015, OBSERVED) | P-170 task-agnosticism: Condorcet test — reusable = improves >50% novel contexts (P-042, OBSERVED) | P-098 knowledge decay: declarative persists, procedural re-derives, tacit vanishes | P-100 beliefs/lesson ≥ 1.0 = compression target; <0.5 = compact | P-115 genesis rules form redundancy network (L-109) | P-120 3-S PENDING: verify within 2 sessions or remove | P-129 swarmability = bootstrap quality — load-bearing S1-S2 only | P-133 genesis: PERMANENT/CATALYST/REDUNDANT — different removal criteria | P-140 distill SPLIT: duplication-check=CATALYST, merge-scan=PERMANENT | P-151 MDL: section-level > atom-level merging (<1% returns); proxy K = bootstrap tokens (L-169, OBSERVED)
**MDL compression**: P-153 cross-tier redundancy = strongest compression signal — P covered by CORE/VERIFY/CLAUDE is pure duplication; T4-tools (43% of K) highest-ROI (L-152, OBSERVED) | P-163 proxy K follows growth-compression sawtooth (~170t/session); re-compress at >6% drift; baseline creeps up (L-168, S165/PHIL-8, OBSERVED) | P-188 lesson Sharpe (citations/lines) identifies compaction candidates: zero-Sharpe + PRINCIPLES.md match = safe target; protocol: zero-Sharpe → check absorbing principle → SUPERSEDED or orphan candidate (L-231, OBSERVED) | P-192 MDL floor: savings <0.5% AND hurts readability → stop; thematic overlap ≠ information redundancy; format serves function beyond tokens (L-166, OBSERVED)
**Self-audit**: P-164 confirmation >80% = underchallenging — audit ~20 sessions (L-170, OBSERVED) | P-175 enforcement tiers: structural (~80% automated) = repo-local; behavioral (~20%) survives substrate changes — cross-substrate needs portable standards (L-210, L-211, F120, OBSERVED) | P-213 closed epistemic loop: self-citation compounds conviction not accuracy; fix = external action, not more measurement (L-495, S342, MEASURED n=384)
**Self-improvement**: P-144 meta-tasks swarmable: fan-out → collect → merge; separate analysis from mutation (OBSERVED) | P-146 cold-start = context-rich "swarm"; maintenance.py + periodics.json close it (OBSERVED) | P-147 maintenance cadence ownership: producer updates `tools/periodics.json` (OBSERVED) | P-152 citation rate = f(era, embedding, usage) — 73.5% dark matter; subtractive test = spawn without principle (L-150, OBSERVED) | P-168 lib ROI = size × domain_independence / coupling — <200L = module; >500L + domain-independent = lib (L-181, OBSERVED) | P-178 swarm work is self-replenishing — each cycle generates ≥1 new task; backlog grows by design (L-215, OBSERVED) | P-180 continuous meta-swarming: every session mandatory meta-reflection — act on friction or file it; human-triggered-only = command-response (L-221, OBSERVED) | P-182 expect-act-diff = universal calibration; brain predictive coding = biological instantiation (L-223, L-433, F123) — SUBSUMED→CORE.11 S341 (bio corollary retained) | P-181 mine domains for structural isomorphisms, not raw knowledge — 5/5 confirmed; no transfer value = low ROI (L-222, L-256, F122, OBSERVED) | P-185 SUBSUMED→PHIL-15 S341 | P-186 "are we measuring X?" → gap → tool → periodic → principle (F121, OBSERVED) | P-187 SUBSUMED→P-200 S341 | P-191 enforcement audit: "are we properly [X]?" = verify machinery, surface gap, close in-session (L-237, F121, OBSERVED) | P-194 frontier "Next:" stale >5 sessions = documentation debt (L-246, OBSERVED) | P-195 SUBSUMED→PHIL-4+P-135 S341 | P-197 high-yield: parallel dispatch + OPEN frontier + overhead <25% + extract L+P; WEAK: sequential + meta-only + no frontier + >40% overhead (L-257, F124, OBSERVED) | P-199 external scouting targets implementation not architecture; scan 3-5 peers → rank impact×reversibility → implement rank-1 (L-276, OBSERVED) | P-200 bare "swarm" = full-cycle autonomy (ICC: 1-word = 30-word at alignment saturation); compound = parallel fan-out (S188/S189, L-363, OBSERVED) | P-201 post-fallow sessions yield ~28% higher Sharpe (n=28); ≥3-session fallow before high-stakes (L-307, PARTIAL) | P-202 quality gates at Work entry, not Compress: anti-repeat + near-dup + stale-lane before acting (L-283, OBSERVED) | P-203 session initiation = throughput ceiling; human = signal + kill-switch, not initiator (L-317, PHIL-3, F134, OBSERVED) | P-204 docs cite observed counts not design intent; label intent-observation gaps (L-320, OBSERVED) | P-205 repeated human signal = unresolved gap; encode as pattern, file P/L (S196, OBSERVED) | P-206 "X for the swarm" = domain donation: seed + 3 ISOs + queue experiment (S301-S302, OBSERVED) | P-209 existential self-challenge → run measurement not argument; measurements refute, arguments self-reinforce (S307, OBSERVED n=1) | P-210 "council+repair" = multi-role falsification: skeptic+adversary+synthesizer; falsify claims against ground truth; council = falsification engine (L-402, F-VVE1, S307-S313, OBSERVED n=3) | P-211 human vocabulary bridge: metaphors → nearest measurable quantity ("smooth"→K_avg, "scale"→fan-out, "drift"→proxy-K%, "jam"→blocked lanes); interpret before acting (L-468, L-473, S335, OBSERVED n=4) | P-212 self-deprivileging: human directs removal of own special status = strongest autonomy transfer; structural privilege elimination; NODES.md instantiation (L-487, S340, OBSERVED n=1) | P-214 tool-to-swarm 5 stages: commanded→learning→reactive→autonomous→swarming-peer; bottleneck = feedback closure; task-open:task-close >2:1 = integral windup (L-500, S343, MEASURED n=22) | P-215 human signals = addressing info (192x amplification): select from latent space; frequency halves/~80 sessions, yield +3.7x; bare autonomy 21.6x more efficient; 65% meta-steering is human-directed (L-504, S344, MEASURED n=104)

## Distributed Systems

**Error handling**: P-095 B14 determinism (74%) and node-count (98%) independent — verify separately | P-097 NK-EH correlation requires import cycles not coupling — DAG languages weak/inverted; cycles for Python, domain sensitivity for Go | P-104 EH dominant failure mode (53% Jepsen, 92% user-reported) — B13 observed 24 systems, 100 bugs, 5 studies | P-105 DAG Go EH predictor = domain sensitivity (+0.274) | P-106 `_, err = fn()` correct — `_, _ = fn()` dangerous | P-128 EH triage: K_norm>0.90 precision; >0.35+runtime-coord recall; contract-type required (L-124, n=22, PARTIALLY OBSERVED) | P-132 K_out/K_in>1.0 = orchestrator classifier (92-97% precision); counter: dual-role infra, leaf-named orchestrators (L-126, OBSERVED) | P-141 Go runtime-coord: EXPORTED ctx.Context only; ctx≥5 + K_out/K_in>1 → high EH risk (L-131, L-133, PARTIALLY OBSERVED)
