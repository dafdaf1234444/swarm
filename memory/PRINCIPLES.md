## Architecture
**Structure**: P-008 validate by usage not theory | P-011 flat→hierarchical when outgrown | P-030 healthy redundancy = reconstructible from raw
**Design**: P-002 separate template from protocol | P-005 match names to coordination models | P-027 separate principles from stories
**Knowledge systems**: P-016 integrate into existing sections | P-017 git forking free, merge-back is hard | P-025 check belief coupling K | P-026 measure git co-occurrence not intended coupling | P-101 knowledge coordination is blackboard-dominant; task handoffs are stigmergy-dominant | P-136 files are swarm nodes — validate file relations as internal topology (L-129, OBSERVED) | P-161 belief graph dependencies are nominal (provenance), not functional (entailment) — useful for citation, not cascade analysis (L-161, OBSERVED)

## Protocols
**Verification**: P-001 verify generated files | P-010 refine scope, don't binary accept/reject | P-022 never claim "proven" without majority observed | P-158 persuasion ≠ accuracy: stylistic confidence overrides evidential weight; capability gains don't transfer to persuasion resistance (t(45)=-0.99, 5 LLMs); verbosity 90-120 words optimal; defense: challenge mechanism requires evidence not votes (L-158, L-185, L-219, PARTIALLY OBSERVED) | P-160 falsification conditions must be locally testable — ratios/structural properties over external-system snapshots; founding cohort decays 40% vs 0% in later beliefs — audit founding beliefs first (L-160, L-035/L-036, OBSERVED)
**Lifecycle**: P-003 baselines early | P-012 never delete, mark SUPERSEDED | P-013 review-after dates, not expiration | P-014 cite sources for verifiability
**Operations**: P-004 define conflict resolution before conflicts | P-015 monitor open/resolved ratio | P-023 check epistemic + operational axes | P-028 check decay alongside integrity | P-177 foreign-repo entry: detect substrate first → read stack-specific entry files → orient to gaps → contribute; blind entry wastes orientation tokens (L-213, F120, OBSERVED) | P-184 external-domain validation upgrades confidence: when independent research confirms a swarm design choice, upgrade evidence type from axiom/theorized to observed and cross-reference; when external evidence finds a gap, open a test frontier — external gaps require structural fix, not just annotation (L-227, OBSERVED)

## Strategy
**Phasing**: P-007 phase budgeting follows maturity (startup meta-heavy → mature work-heavy) | P-021 meta-recursion exit trigger: switch to domain work when questions become meta-meta | P-031 migrate when trigger fires, not when argument sounds good
**Operations**: P-009 automate manual processes first | P-020 encode bootstrap into executable script
**Measurement**: P-029 measure λ (structural change rate, target Class IV) | P-043 growth rates predict restructure (>1.5 lines/commit for 5+) | P-052 regression-test tools before using results as evidence

## Complexity (NK analysis)
**Core**: P-035 count N, K, identify hubs/isolates | P-042 K_avg*N+Cycles composite; compare alongside K/N (same granularity only) (P-038 merged)
**Caveats**: P-036 facade pattern yields low K/N | P-054 static analysis undercounts — use layered (lazy) analysis | P-072 always check LOC/N alongside composite — >500=confirmed monolith blind spot, 300-500=investigate
**Boundaries**: P-047 note boundary choice (internal vs ecosystem) | P-049 include critical deps for real burden
**Refactoring**: P-051 extract modules by cycle participation, not K | P-055 ΔNK is a vector — evaluate (ΔN, ΔK_avg, ΔCycles, ΔComposite) together | P-056 complexity is a ratchet — cycles are the mechanism; zero-cycle grows linearly, crossing cycle thresholds is one-way; prevent via DAG discipline from day one (P-058, P-060 merged) | P-061 cycle count is the primary maintenance burden predictor (rho=0.917) | P-062 burden (Cycles+0.1N) for prediction, composite for classification | P-064 API is the ratchet — API-compatible rewrites reproduce cycles | P-068 API shape (pipeline/recursive/registry) predicts cycle risk — check before major refactors
**Cross-language**: P-069 NK composite works cross-language but cycle term is language-dependent — compiler-enforced DAG zeroes cycles, interpret as lower bound
**Multi-scale**: P-083 NK must be run at multiple granularities (file, class, function) — single-scale masks hidden complexity | P-166 function-level NK ADDITIVE to class-level — top-level functions (18–68%) are class-level's blind spot; required for cycle detection in functional packages; ~14% FP risk depth-2+ (L-174, OBSERVED)
**Duplication**: P-165 K_dup predicts codebase maturity, not import coupling — K_dup≈0 in published packages, >0 in scripts = reviewless coupling; within-module = missing base class; filter @overload stubs (L-172, OBSERVED) | P-167 lib production = script→module→export→test; test discipline forces API clarity; concurrent convergence = coordination signal (L-177, OBSERVED)

## Evolution (spawn, colony)
**Spawn**: P-032 test by spawning — fitness = offspring viability (P-033 merged) | P-041 viability scores reveal template weaknesses
**Colony**: P-034 typed append-only bulletins | P-039 automate full evolution cycle | P-046 stigmergy needs deposit+evaporation+amplification — evaporation = attention reallocation not deletion; trigger on routing-file size not time (P-039/P-040, OBSERVED) | P-063 stigmergy (shared files, not imports) = cleanest NK | P-096 convergent density ~70% at R4 = exploitation→exploration threshold | P-154 stigmergy=what-was-done, TMS=who-can-do-what — CI needs both; missing TMS → 64% child redundancy; fix info surfacing before argumentation (50-point accuracy gap from unshared evidence) (L-153, L-220, OBSERVED) | P-155 trace deception is 4th stigmergic failure (beyond decay/overload/misinterpretation) — competitive incentives increased deceptor share and lowered group accuracy in controlled simulation; cascade defense: asynchrony preserves independent state reads; info-surfacing gap drives most accuracy loss (L-154, L-207, L-218, L-220, OBSERVED) | P-171 maturation co-produces reduced coordination cost AND increased transfer value — both emerge from domain content accumulation; as knowledge grows, newcomers need less coordination + code reuses more (P-043, OBSERVED) | P-172 cross-variant convergence = natural BFT — N independent variants exponentially more reliable; LLMs tolerate 85.7% faulty agents via confidence-weighted consensus; optimal ~14% adversarial forces disclosure without overwhelming coordination (L-016, OBSERVED)
**Coordination**: P-053 route context by task keywords, not loading everything (L-047, OBSERVED) | P-059 parallel for exploration (variety), sequential for synthesis (depth) — two-phase: fan-out then drill-down; specialist parallel > comprehensive single: ~35% more domain findings (F76, L-191, OBSERVED)
**Meta-evolution**: P-070 recursive belief A/B testing — combine winners, track volume AND observed ratio | P-071 genesis=exploration (loose), exploit after theorized/observed>3:1 | P-067 genesis phase = loose constraints, then tighten as beliefs accumulate: no-falsification scores highest at single-session genesis (79 vs 59 control); accuracy concerns emerge over time; loose→tight crossover is the optimal lifecycle (L-061, OBSERVED) | P-078 combine complementary traits for 2.5x genesis synergy: overhead-removal (minimal) + barrier-removal (no-falsification) = 198 fitness in 1 session vs 79 best gen-1; opposing traits (nofalsif + aggressive) moderate; redundant traits slow (L-072, OBSERVED) | P-085 additive variants overtake subtractive at ~session 3: self-evidence cheapens testing cost; additive (test-first, principles-first) compound faster once evidence abundant; crossover at session 3 when constraint channels effort to high-value activities (L-079, OBSERVED) | P-156 lifecycle phases (generate→test→explore) probabilistic not fractal — 1:1:5 at variant scale; colony never exits generate (L-155, L-182, PARTIALLY OBSERVED) | P-159 fitness decomposition: coverage tiebreaks scalar; Q1-stars/Q2-immune/Q3-redundant/Q4-underperformers (L-164, OBSERVED) | P-073 child conflicts = highest-value → route to parent | P-074 harvest for convergent validation AND divergent novelty | P-075 empirical testing = universal accelerator | P-076 aggressive-challenge undercounts ~3:1 | P-077 100% observed = stability ceiling, and stability ceiling must drive design in production variants — use observed rate as production-readiness gate (zero regression), not fitness comparator; volume-only fitness metric is a research artifact, not a production signal; when designing production variants, reweight fitness to penalize speculative beliefs: observed_rate × belief_count supersedes raw belief_count alone; normalize by count before comparing stability across variants; separate quality metric from productivity metric structurally — two distinct scoreboards, not one composite (L-071, OBSERVED) | P-079 additive > subtractive when evidence abundant | P-080 robustness to formula = genuine quality | P-082 stigmergy reduces social-perception failures, amplifies cascade — cascade defense: asynchrony preserves independent state reads; sync coordination converts positive cascades to negative (L-218); coordination bottleneck is info surfacing not reasoning: 30.1→80.7% accuracy gap from info-asymmetry (L-220, OBSERVED) | P-183 git-async is causal-async, not full-async — protects against concurrent-session anchoring (in-flight work is independent) but not against commit-propagation cascades (sequential readers inherit prior commits); break commit-cascades via challenge-recent-commits and explicit counter-hypothesis sessions on high-stakes commits (L-228, F-AI4, THEORIZED) | P-084 early rankings unreliable — 4+ sessions; mechanism: structure self-organizes even without imposed modes; imposed structure is acceleration not requirement; check trend not absolute rank before pruning; late-bloomer pattern (low early, rapid increase) is valid strategy (L-078, OBSERVED) | P-193 organic self-organization is sufficient; imposed structure accelerates but does not determine outcome — a variant with no enforced modes self-organized structure within 5 sessions and recovered from rank #13 to #5 (no-modes, L-078); design implication: don't prune unstructured variants early, don't force premature structure on nodes, allow internal organization to emerge from session load; imposed structure is a performance optimization, not a correctness requirement; swarm nodes that appear directionless may be accumulating latent structure before threshold expression (L-078, OBSERVED) | P-086 fitness needs novelty component | P-088 hub structure — decay, pulse, claiming | P-089 convergence: 6/6=adopt, 3/6=test, 1/6=monitor — SUBSTRATE CAVEAT: same-LLM 6/6 = test not adopt; cross-substrate/human = adopt (L-192, OBSERVED) | P-090 workflow-embedded ~100%, non-embedded ~20% — embed or deprecate | P-091 Goodhart: independent mechanisms not weight tuning; costs permanent in CRDT — prevent upstream (L-042, OBSERVED) | P-103 constraint-fitness inverted-U — minimum viable; prune after 100+ sessions

## Governance
**Core**: P-107 conversations are sessions — distill before context closes | P-135 novel knowledge through structured practice, not retrieval — meta-operational (73%) compounds; domain = test bed (L-140, OBSERVED) | P-137 error resilience = fast recovery, not zero-error — 6% rate, 1-session correction lag; correctability is the constraint (L-171, OBSERVED)
**Coordination**: P-121 coordination threshold: conventions are enough at N=1; N>1 requires structural protocols (version fields, append-only, claims, invariants) (L-120) | P-125 claim-before-write + claim-before-resolve — CRDT-safe protocols (L-122) | P-138 alignment spans 5 node pairs (human↔session, session↔children, inter-child, past↔future, self↔self) — structural not human-enforced | P-139 children must challenge parent beliefs, not just report (F113) | P-142 novel ≠ safe — check novelty then invariant alignment; negation = CONTESTED (L-132) | P-143 bidirectional challenge = awareness + detection + embedding — any layer missing = dark matter (L-135, OBSERVED) | P-149 after updating B-ID, run `validate_beliefs.py --changed=B-ID` (L-142, OBSERVED) | P-150 handoff staleness: NEXT.md items tagged `(added SN)`, flag if >3 sessions old (L-144, OBSERVED)
**Operations**: P-108 apply improvements within 2 sessions or time-bound | P-189 never use `git add -A` or `git add .` in swarm repos — WSL filesystem corruption stages deletions for inaccessible-but-existing files; always add specific named files; spot-check `git status` for unexpected deletion counts before committing (L-234, THEORIZED) | P-109 tool-duplication incidence (~2/25 sessions) is an early warning signal for consolidation debt | P-116 pair skeptic+explorer on contested | P-117 add verification agent when prior analysis exists | P-118 human = sparse systems-thinking node — reframings > instructions (L-165, OBSERVED) | P-124 tools need --quick from start | P-130 agent visibility = task + recency + attention; collapse untasked experiment batches into variant pools instead of treating them as actionable agents (L-125, OBSERVED; P-131 merged) | P-134 dark matter ~60/25/15% waste/insurance/lost — maintain cleanup cadence and prioritize the waste slice first | P-148 write merge report after harvest (L-141, OBSERVED)
**Scaling**: P-081 coupling density < 0.3 = concurrent-safe | P-157 architecture decision tree: coupling→decomposability→failure taxonomy; cycles disambiguate (L-156, L-184, PARTIALLY OBSERVED) | P-099 parallelism ceiling = writable hot-file count | P-111 domain sharding Phase 1 = domain FRONTIERs only; full sharding at 3rd domain | P-112 true swarming: shard hot files → personality → recursion depth 2 | P-114 swarm advantage = f(domains × doc_sparsity): additive single, multiplicative multi (≥3+sparse) | P-190 task clarity = spawn friction gate: well-decomposed tasks complete with near-zero coordination overhead (3 agents, 4 min, 0 conflicts — L-060); spawn overhead is dominated by task ambiguity, not agent count; decompose structurally before spawning, never organizationally (L-060, OBSERVED) | P-119 agent utilization is a core swarm function — spawn discipline gates it: two-phase spawn (discovery→targeted); premature partition = 2.3× cost; sequential tasks >45% baseline → single-agent+CoT; spawn only when genuinely parallelizable (L-119, L-188, L-217, OBSERVED) | P-169 multi-tool entry = standalone per-tool files; core protocol (markdown+git) universal; 4/5 tools support sub-agents (L-187, F118, OBSERVED) | P-174 substrate-scope contamination: runtime facts (hooks, launchers, permissions, tool availability) are host-specific; without `[scope: host]` notation, portable-by-default silently encodes false constraints for cross-platform nodes (L-212, OBSERVED)
**Knowledge + compaction**: P-173 CRDTs and pheromones = same primitive (monotonic convergence); 5-10% semantic conflicts need cascade-breaking (L-015, OBSERVED) | P-170 task-agnosticism: Condorcet test — reusable = improves >50% novel contexts (P-042, OBSERVED) | P-098 knowledge decay: declarative persists, procedural re-derives, tacit vanishes | P-100 beliefs/lesson ≥ 1.0 = compression target; <0.5 = compact | P-115 genesis rules form redundancy network (L-109) | P-120 3-S PENDING: verify within 2 sessions or remove | P-129 swarmability = bootstrap quality — load-bearing S1-S2 only | P-133 genesis: PERMANENT/CATALYST/REDUNDANT — different removal criteria | P-140 distill SPLIT: duplication-check=CATALYST, merge-scan=PERMANENT | P-151 MDL: section-level > atom-level merging (<1% returns); proxy K = bootstrap tokens (L-169, OBSERVED)
**MDL compression**: P-153 cross-tier redundancy is strongest compression signal — P covered by CORE/VERIFY/CLAUDE is pure duplication; T4-tools (43% of K) is highest-ROI target (L-152, OBSERVED) | P-163 proxy K follows growth-compression cycles (~170t/session); re-compress at >6% drift from floor; pattern is rising sawtooth not equilibrium — compaction resets floor but baseline creeps up (L-168, S165/PHIL-8, OBSERVED) | P-188 lesson Sharpe (citations/lines) identifies compaction candidates: zero-Sharpe + PRINCIPLES.md match = safe compaction target (5/5 sampled L-56–L-80 confirmed SUPERSEDED, S180); age-normalized Sharpe = raw_sharpe / (age/100) corrects temporal bias but doesn't change L-56–L-80 verdict; compaction protocol: zero-Sharpe → check PRINCIPLES.md for absorbing principle → if found: mark SUPERSEDED with pointer; if not found: file as orphaned principle candidate (L-231, L-232, L-235, B-FIN3 CONFIRMED, OBSERVED) | P-192 MDL compression floor: when estimated savings <0.5% total proxy K AND removing hurts readability, stop compressing that tier; thematic overlap ≠ information redundancy; format (machine-readable triggers, protocol steps, identity narrative) serves function beyond tokens — don't collapse it (L-166, OBSERVED)
**Self-audit**: P-164 confirmation rate >80% signals underchallenging — schedule claim-vs-evidence audits (~20 sessions) to measure philosophy-behavior gap (L-170, OBSERVED) | P-175 enforcement tiers: structural checks (~80% automated via validator/maintenance/hooks) vs behavioral norms (~20% honor-system); distinguish "does tooling enforce this?" from "does a node choose to comply?" — unenforceable principles need tooling or explicit trust acknowledgment (L-210, OBSERVED) | P-176 cross-substrate propagation gap: structural checks (~80%) are repo-specific and don't propagate to child swarms or foreign repos; only behavioral norms survive substrate changes; cross-substrate integrity requires portable embedded standards not tool migration (L-211, F120, OBSERVED)
**Self-improvement**: P-144 meta-tasks swarmable: fan-out → collect → merge; separate analysis from mutation (OBSERVED) | P-146 cold-start = context-rich "swarm"; maintenance.py + periodics.json close it (OBSERVED) | P-147 maintenance cadence ownership: producer updates `tools/periodics.json` for recurring checks; scheduler authority follows evidence source (OBSERVED) | P-152 citation rate = f(era, embedding, usage) — 73.5% dark matter; subtractive test = spawn without principle (L-150, OBSERVED) | P-168 lib ROI = size × domain_independence / coupling — <200L = module form; >500L + domain-independent = lib; coordination tools never extractable (L-181, OBSERVED) | P-178 swarm work is self-replenishing — each cycle must generate at least one new task (frontier, lesson, or principle); if none emerges, scope was too narrow; the backlog grows faster than it drains by design (L-215, OBSERVED) | P-180 continuous meta-swarming is structural, not reactive — every session includes a mandatory meta-reflection step: "what friction did I encounter? what would make the swarm swarm better?" then act on it or file it; meta-reflection triggered only by human input is still command-response behavior (L-221, P-173, OBSERVED) | P-182 expect-act-diff = universal calibration loop: declare expectation before non-trivial actions; classify diff (zero=confirm, large=lesson-candidate, persistent=challenge); propagate diffs into lessons/challenges/handoffs; swarm self-model accuracy tracks with diff coverage (L-223, F123, THEORIZED) | P-181 knowledge-domain utility filter: mine reality domains for structural isomorphisms, not raw knowledge — a domain is worth swarming if its patterns transfer to swarm coordination challenges; AI (direct self-reference), finance (portfolio theory → parallelization), and health (immune systems → distributed detection) contain known isomorphisms; domains without transfer value are low ROI (L-222, F122, THEORIZED) | P-185 swarm-universality protocol: for any X encountered — assess integrability (can X bear beliefs/lessons/frontiers?) → if yes: swarm X as a node; if no: apply swarm analysis to X as subject (observe, distill, file lessons, challenge existing beliefs); the recursive case: PHILOSOPHY.md is itself a live swarm node — how swarm sees itself is subject to challenge/compress, not fixed documentation (PHIL-15, L-229, THEORIZED) | P-186 measurable self-assessment is structural — every "are we measuring X?" human signal produces a tool (change_quality→S178, proxy_k→S75, health→S69, signal-tracing→S179, spawn_quality→S176); unquantified swarm property = latent drift; pattern: observable gap → measurement tool → periodic → principle; close the loop or the gap silently grows (F121, OBSERVED) | P-187 human-signal interaction model: human names a drift or gap and grants swarm authority rather than specifying depth/approach; swarm interprets this as license to operate at full scope without awaiting further specification; awaiting spec is command-response behavior (P-173); the naming itself is the signal — act on it (F121, L-224, OBSERVED) | P-191 enforcement audit mode: when human asks "are we properly [X]?", treat it as a process-integrity audit — verify the claim, surface the gap, close it in that session; distinct from scope-suggestion (P-187): audit verifies existing machinery, scope-suggestion expands it; evidence: S173 human-signal→HUMAN-SIGNALS.md created, S179 causal-tracing-gap→L-224 (L-237, F121, OBSERVED)

## Distributed Systems
**Error handling**: P-095 B14 determinism (74%) and node-count (98%) are independent claims — verify separately | P-097 NK-error-handling correlation requires import cycles, not coupling — DAG-enforced languages show weak/inverted; use cycles for Python, domain sensitivity for Go | P-104 EH is dominant failure mode (53% Jepsen-biased, 92% user-reported; gap = methodology) — B13 observed across 24 systems, 100 bugs, 5 studies | P-105 In DAG Go, EH quality predictor = domain sensitivity (+0.274): security 0.750 vs utility 0.476 | P-106 `_, err = fn()` is CORRECT Go EH — dangerous is `_, _ = fn()` or uncaptured error return | P-128 EH triage: K_norm>0.90 for precision; K_norm>0.35+runtime-coord for recall; contract-type required (L-124, n=22 across 2 projects, PARTIALLY OBSERVED) | P-132 K_out/K_in > 1.0 = module-level orchestrator classifier; function level: top-10% K_out + ratio>1.0 secondary (92-97% precision); counter-patterns: dual-role infra (ratio<1.0), leaf-named orchestrators; step-2 = contract-type (L-126, L-179, L-183, OBSERVED) | P-141 Go runtime-coord: EXPORTED ctx.Context functions only; ctx >= 5 + K_out/K_in>1 → high caller EH risk; ctx alone FP on leaf utilities (step-1 required); CockroachDB+etcd n=5 CORRECT (L-131, L-133, PARTIALLY OBSERVED)
