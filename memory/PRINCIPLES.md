## Architecture
**Structure**: P-008 validate by usage not theory | P-011 flat→hierarchical when outgrown | P-030 healthy redundancy = reconstructible from raw
**Design**: P-002 separate template from protocol | P-005 match names to coordination models | P-027 separate principles from stories
**Knowledge systems**: P-016 integrate into existing sections | P-017 git forking free, merge-back is hard | P-025 check belief coupling K | P-026 measure git co-occurrence not intended coupling | P-101 knowledge coordination is blackboard-dominant; task handoffs are stigmergy-dominant | P-136 files are swarm nodes — validate file relations as internal topology (L-129, OBSERVED) | P-161 belief graph dependencies are nominal (provenance), not functional (entailment) — useful for citation, not cascade analysis (L-161, OBSERVED)

## Protocols
**Verification**: P-001 verify generated files | P-010 refine scope, don't binary accept/reject | P-022 never claim "proven" without majority observed | P-158 persuasion ≠ accuracy: stylistic confidence overrides evidential weight; verbosity 90-120w optimal; defense requires evidence not votes (L-158, PARTIALLY OBSERVED) | P-160 falsification must be locally testable — ratios over external snapshots; founding cohort decays 40% vs 0% — audit founding beliefs first (L-160, OBSERVED)
**Lifecycle**: P-003 baselines early | P-013 review-after dates, not expiration
**Operations**: P-004 define conflict resolution before conflicts | P-015 monitor open/resolved ratio | P-023 check epistemic + operational axes (operational: integrity + decay) | P-177 foreign-repo entry: detect substrate → read entry files → orient → contribute; blind entry wastes tokens (L-213, F120, OBSERVED) | P-184 external validation upgrades confidence: independent confirmation → upgrade to observed; external gap → open test frontier (L-227, OBSERVED)

## Strategy
**Phasing**: P-007 phase budgeting follows maturity (startup meta-heavy → mature work-heavy) | P-021 meta-recursion exit trigger: switch to domain work when questions become meta-meta | P-031 migrate when trigger fires, not when argument sounds good
**Operations**: P-009 automate manual processes first | P-020 encode bootstrap into executable script
**Measurement**: P-232 accumulation scoring amplifies exploitation: any scoring system where points accumulate (visits, citations, output count) concentrates resources on already-explored domains; counter with logarithmic frequency penalties and Gini-triggered exploration modes — uncorrected scoring worsened Gini 27%, corrected reduced concentration 37% (L-571, L-594, L-621, L-654, S366, MEASURED n=4 scoring regimes) | P-029 measure λ (structural change rate, target Class IV) | P-043 growth rates predict restructure (>1.5 lines/commit for 5+) | P-052 regression-test tools before using results as evidence

## Complexity (NK analysis)
**Core**: P-035 count N, K, identify hubs/isolates | P-042 K_avg*N+Cycles composite; compare alongside K/N (same granularity only) (P-038 merged)
**Caveats**: P-036 facade pattern yields low K/N | P-054 static analysis undercounts — use layered (lazy) analysis | P-072 always check LOC/N alongside composite — >500=confirmed monolith blind spot, 300-500=investigate
**Boundaries**: P-047 note boundary choice (internal vs ecosystem) | P-049 include critical deps for real burden
**Refactoring**: P-051 extract modules by cycle participation, not K | P-055 ΔNK is a vector — evaluate (ΔN, ΔK_avg, ΔCycles, ΔComposite) together | P-056 complexity ratchet: cycles are mechanism; zero-cycle = linear, crossing thresholds = one-way; DAG discipline from day one (P-058, P-060 merged) | P-061 cycle count = primary maintenance burden predictor (rho=0.917) | P-062 burden (Cycles+0.1N) for prediction, composite for classification | P-064 API is the ratchet — compatible rewrites reproduce cycles | P-068 API shape (pipeline/recursive/registry) predicts cycle risk
**Cross-language**: P-069 NK composite works cross-language but cycle term is language-dependent — compiler-enforced DAG zeroes cycles, interpret as lower bound
**Multi-scale**: P-083 NK at multiple granularities (file, class, function) — single-scale masks complexity | P-166 function-level NK ADDITIVE to class-level — top-level functions (18–68%) are blind spot; required for functional package cycle detection; ~14% FP depth-2+ (L-174, OBSERVED)
**Duplication**: P-165 K_dup predicts maturity not import coupling — K_dup≈0 published, >0 scripts = reviewless coupling; within-module = missing base class (L-172, OBSERVED) | P-167 lib production = script→module→export→test; test forces API clarity; concurrent convergence = coordination signal (L-177, OBSERVED)

## Evolution (spawn, colony)
**Spawn**: P-032 test by spawning — fitness = offspring viability (P-033 merged) | P-041 viability scores reveal template weaknesses
**Colony**: P-034 typed append-only bulletins | P-039 automate full evolution cycle | P-046 stigmergy: deposit+evaporation+amplification; evaporation=attention reallocation; trigger on size not time (OBSERVED) | P-063 stigmergy (shared files) = cleanest NK | P-096 convergent density ~70% at R4 = exploitation→exploration | P-154 stigmergy=what-was-done, TMS=who-can-do-what; missing TMS→64% redundancy (L-153, L-220, OBSERVED) | P-171 maturation co-produces reduced cost AND increased transfer (P-043, OBSERVED) | P-172 cross-variant convergence = natural BFT; 85.7% faulty tolerance; ~14% adversarial optimal (L-016, OBSERVED)
**Coordination**: P-053 route context by task keywords (L-047, OBSERVED) | P-059 parallel for exploration, sequential for synthesis; specialist parallel ~35% more (F76, L-191, OBSERVED) | P-196 portfolio variance metric-specific: accuracy∝1/N; wall time increases with N (L-251, L-253, F-FIN1, OBSERVED) | P-198 two error regimes: systematic→fix source; idiosyncratic→majority vote; belief hygiene > N (L-259, F-FIN2, OBSERVED) | P-207 active frontier → ≥1 DOMEX lane; 16/37 unserved pre-enforcement (L-349, S302, OBSERVED)
**Meta-evolution**: P-231 Lamarckian correction immunity: directed (evidence-based) correction prevents quality degradation regardless of mutation rate — threshold theories apply only to undirected/random mutation; a system where each correction improves quality is immune to degradation thresholds; 2.4x past predicted threshold without degradation (L-553, L-563, L-626, L-633, S366, MEASURED n=4 independent tests) | P-070 recursive belief A/B testing — combine winners, track volume AND observed ratio | P-067 genesis = loose constraints, tighten as beliefs accumulate (L-061, OBSERVED) | P-078 complementary 2.5x synergy; opposing moderate; redundant slow (L-072, OBSERVED) | P-085 additive overtakes subtractive at ~session 3 (L-079, OBSERVED) | P-156 lifecycle phases probabilistic not fractal; colony never exits generate (L-155, PARTIALLY OBSERVED) | P-159 fitness: Q1-stars/Q2-immune/Q3-redundant/Q4-underperformers (L-164, OBSERVED) | P-073 child conflicts = highest-value → route to parent | P-074 harvest for convergent validation AND divergent novelty | P-076 aggressive-challenge undercounts ~3:1 | P-077 100% observed = stability ceiling; separate quality from productivity scoreboards (L-071, OBSERVED) | P-080 robustness to formula = genuine quality | P-082 stigmergy reduces social-perception failures; 4 modes; cascade defense: asynchrony; surfacing 30→81% (L-154, L-220, OBSERVED) | P-183 git-async protects anchoring not commit-propagation cascades (L-228, THEORIZED) | P-084 early rankings unreliable 4+s; organic self-org sufficient (P-193 merged, L-078, OBSERVED) | P-089 convergence: 6/6=adopt, 3/6=test, 1/6=monitor; cross-substrate=adopt (L-192, OBSERVED) | P-090 workflow-embedded ~100%, non-embedded ~20% — embed or deprecate | P-091 Goodhart: independent mechanisms not weight tuning (L-042, OBSERVED) | P-103 constraint-fitness inverted-U; prune after 100+ sessions

## Governance
**Core**: P-135 novel knowledge through structured practice, not retrieval — meta-operational (73%) compounds; domain = test bed (L-140, OBSERVED) | P-137 error resilience = fast recovery, not zero-error — 6% rate, 1-session correction lag (L-171, OBSERVED)
**Coordination**: P-121 conventions at N=1; N>1 requires structural protocols (version fields, append-only, claims, invariants) (L-120) | P-125 claim-before-write + claim-before-resolve — CRDT-safe (L-122) | P-138 alignment spans 5 node pairs — structural not human-enforced | P-139 children must challenge parent beliefs (F113) | P-142 novel ≠ safe — check novelty then invariant alignment; negation = CONTESTED (L-132) | P-143 bidirectional challenge = awareness + detection + embedding — any missing = dark matter (L-135, OBSERVED) | P-149 after updating B-ID, run `validate_beliefs.py --changed=B-ID` (L-142, OBSERVED) | P-150 handoff staleness: NEXT.md items tagged `(added SN)`, flag if >3 sessions old (L-144, OBSERVED)
**Operations**: P-108 apply improvements within 2 sessions or time-bound | P-189 never `git add -A` or `git add .` — WSL corruption stages deletions; always add named files (L-234, THEORIZED) | P-109 tool-duplication (~2/25 sessions) = consolidation debt signal | P-118 human = sparse systems-thinking node — reframings > instructions (L-165, OBSERVED) | P-124 tools need --quick from start | P-130 agent visibility = task + recency + attention; collapse untasked batches into variant pools (L-125, OBSERVED; P-131 merged) | P-134 dark matter ~60/25/15% waste/insurance/lost — prioritize waste slice | P-148 write merge report after harvest (L-141, OBSERVED)
**Scaling**: P-230 bottleneck migration: protecting one resource from concurrent contention shifts collision to the next unprotected resource — each protection layer reveals the next vulnerability; plan for cascading bottleneck discovery (L-557, L-589, L-602, L-656, S366, MEASURED n=4 successive bottleneck layers) | P-081 coupling density <0.3 = concurrent-safe | P-157 architecture: coupling→decomposability→failure; cycles disambiguate (L-156, PARTIALLY OBSERVED) | P-099 parallelism ceiling = writable hot-file count | P-111 domain sharding Phase 1 = domain FRONTIERs only | P-112 true swarming: shard hot files→personality→depth 2 | P-114 swarm advantage = f(domains×doc_sparsity); multiplicative at ≥3+sparse | P-190 task clarity = spawn friction gate; premature partition = 2.3x cost (L-060, OBSERVED) | P-119 spawn discipline: sequential >45%→single-agent+CoT; spawn only when parallelizable (L-119, OBSERVED) | P-169 multi-tool entry = standalone per-tool files; core protocol universal (L-187, F118, OBSERVED) | P-174 substrate-scope: runtime facts host-specific; portable-by-default encodes false constraints (L-212, OBSERVED)
**Knowledge + compaction**: P-173 CRDTs and pheromones = same primitive (monotonic convergence); 5-10% semantic conflicts need cascade-breaking (L-015, OBSERVED) | P-170 task-agnosticism: Condorcet test — reusable = improves >50% novel contexts (P-042, OBSERVED) | P-098 knowledge decay: declarative persists, procedural re-derives, tacit vanishes | P-100 beliefs/lesson ≥ 1.0 = compression target; <0.5 = compact | P-115 genesis rules form redundancy network (L-109) | P-120 3-S PENDING: verify within 2 sessions or remove | P-129 swarmability = bootstrap quality — load-bearing S1-S2 only | P-133 genesis: PERMANENT/CATALYST/REDUNDANT — different removal criteria | P-140 distill SPLIT: duplication-check=CATALYST, merge-scan=PERMANENT | P-151 MDL: section-level > atom-level merging (<1% returns); proxy K = bootstrap tokens (L-169, OBSERVED)
**MDL compression**: P-153 cross-tier redundancy = strongest compression signal — P covered by CORE/VERIFY/CLAUDE is pure duplication; T4-tools (43% of K) highest-ROI (L-152, OBSERVED) | P-163 proxy K follows growth-compression sawtooth (~170t/session); re-compress at >6% drift; baseline creeps up (L-168, S165/PHIL-8, OBSERVED) | P-188 lesson Sharpe (citations/lines) identifies compaction candidates: zero-Sharpe + PRINCIPLES.md match = safe target; protocol: zero-Sharpe → check absorbing principle → SUPERSEDED or orphan candidate (L-231, OBSERVED) | P-192 MDL floor: savings <0.5% AND hurts readability → stop; thematic overlap ≠ information redundancy; format serves function beyond tokens (L-166, OBSERVED)
**Self-audit**: P-223 measurement channel coverage: when a diagnostic tool's data-reading scope falls behind the system's actual data (format evolution, archive splits, regex drift), the tool produces systematically wrong conclusions silently — tool scope must match data scope; archive-aware reads required (L-555, L-572, L-625, L-574, L-596, S366, MEASURED n=5 tools) | P-164 confirmation >80% = underchallenging — audit ~20 sessions (L-170, OBSERVED) | P-175 enforcement tiers: structural (~80% automated) = repo-local; behavioral (~20%) survives substrate changes — cross-substrate needs portable standards (L-210, L-211, F120, OBSERVED) | P-213 closed epistemic loop: self-citation compounds conviction not accuracy; fix = external action, not more measurement (L-495, S342, MEASURED n=384) | P-217 substrate-verification: applying formalism X to system Y produces numbers, not evidence that X's phenomena occur in Y; verify substrate conditions before importing interpretive consequences — N_e computation ≠ biological drift, phase-boundary computation ≠ phase transition (L-599, S355, MEASURED n=7 adversarial experts) | P-218 session-boundary decay: protocol compliance without schema enforcement decays to structural floor at session boundaries; measure sustainable compliance (structural floor), not sprint peaks — fix at creation not at audit time; format IS the enforcement mechanism: structured templates achieve compliance by construction (89.7% vs 39% voluntary); intention-based compliance ("remember to add X") fails (L-601, L-590, L-646, L-660, L-661, S355/S365, MEASURED n=10 protocols) | P-219 creation-time verification: verify assumptions at creation time — retroactive audits cost ~100x prevention; applies to substrate-tripwires (verify domain X core objects exist before importing formalism), test contracts (check API boundaries at build time), and invariant enforcement (define then enforce immediately); each additional session of undetected drift compounds fix cost (L-628, L-630, L-584, L-585, L-588, L-657, S358/S366, MEASURED n=7 cases across 4 categories) | P-220 signal-type shift: human signals transition from corrective (fix broken machinery) to generative (expand domain) as swarm matures; corrective repeat = unresolved gap (P-216); generative = expansion opportunity; bare "swarm" majority = operational maturity — monitor type not just volume (L-652, S361, MEASURED n=14)
**Causal inference**: P-233 observational fitness confound: selection-loop tools operating on observational data (uncontrolled session counts, variable experimental attention) produce correlations that conflate treatment effect with attention allocation — causal claims require matched-budget experiments (same session count per variant); observational rankings are hypotheses to test, not prescriptions to follow; Simpson's paradox is the default expectation in uncontrolled self-study (L-666, S367, MEASURED n=33 children, 7 configs)
**Self-improvement**: P-144 meta-tasks swarmable: fan-out→collect→merge; separate analysis from mutation (OBSERVED) | P-146 cold-start = context-rich "swarm"; maintenance.py+periodics.json (OBSERVED) | P-147 maintenance cadence: producer updates periodics.json (OBSERVED) | P-152 citation rate = f(era, embedding, usage); 73.5% dark matter (L-150, OBSERVED) | P-168 lib ROI = size×domain_independence/coupling; <200L=module, >500L=lib (L-181, OBSERVED) | P-178 swarm work self-replenishing; backlog grows by design (L-215, OBSERVED) | P-180 mandatory meta-reflection every session (L-221, OBSERVED) | P-181 mine ISOs not raw knowledge; no transfer value = low ROI (L-222, F122, OBSERVED) | P-186 "measuring X?" → gap→tool→periodic→principle (F121, OBSERVED) | P-191 enforcement audit: verify machinery, surface gap, close in-session (L-237, OBSERVED) | P-194 frontier "Next:" stale >5s = debt (L-246, OBSERVED) | P-197 high-yield: parallel+OPEN frontier+<25% overhead; WEAK: sequential+meta+>40% (L-257, OBSERVED) | P-199 external scouting: implementation not architecture; rank impact×reversibility (L-276, OBSERVED) | P-200 "swarm" = full-cycle autonomy; compound = parallel fan-out (L-363, OBSERVED) | P-201 post-fallow +28% Sharpe (n=28); ≥3s fallow before high-stakes (L-307, PARTIAL) | P-202 quality gates at Work entry not Compress (L-283, OBSERVED) | P-203 session initiation = throughput ceiling; human = signal+kill-switch (L-317, OBSERVED) | P-204 cite observed counts not design intent (L-320, OBSERVED) | P-205 repeated human signal = unresolved gap (S196, OBSERVED) | P-206 domain donation: seed+3 ISOs+queue experiment (S301, OBSERVED) | P-209 self-challenge → measurement not argument (S307, OBSERVED n=1) | P-210 council+repair = multi-role falsification engine (L-402, OBSERVED n=3) | P-211 human vocabulary bridge: metaphors→measurables (L-468, OBSERVED n=4) | P-212 self-deprivileging = strongest autonomy transfer (L-487, OBSERVED n=1) | P-214 tool-to-swarm 5 stages; bottleneck=feedback closure; open:close>2:1=windup (L-500, MEASURED n=22) | P-215 human signals = 192x amplification addressing info; bare autonomy 21.6x efficient (L-504, MEASURED n=104) | P-216 three-signal rule: N=1→log, N=2→task, N=3→structural fix required (L-582, OBSERVED n=3) | P-221 loop-closure quality: prediction without feedback is decoration; recording actual outcome + diff from expectation is the mechanism quality emerges from — full EAD +39.8pp merge rate vs none, expect-only intermediate at 62.5%; additionally, EAD creates structural knowledge integration: DOMEX sessions produce 3.0 edges/L (d=0.45 vs non-DOMEX 1.98) because evidence-citing is structurally required; enforce closure at task completion not as post-hoc review (L-646, L-665, S360/S367, MEASURED n=849 lanes + n=480 lessons) | P-222 hierarchical distillation enforcement: when upstream knowledge production is enforced but downstream synthesis is voluntary, leaves accumulate faster than structure — lesson→principle rate declined 20.4%→16.5% over 140 lessons because DOMEX lanes enforce lesson creation but not principle extraction; enforce at each level of the knowledge hierarchy (L-659, S365, MEASURED n=597L/173P) | P-224 self-exciting production: knowledge production in self-directed systems follows Hawkes process (r≈0.68), not memoryless Poisson — productive sessions predict follow-on bursts; plan for clustering and harvest-dominant phases (L-608, S356, MEASURED n=350, IoD=3.54, ΔAIC=186.4) | P-225 absorption-bounded throughput: total output is bounded by knowledge-absorption rate, not agent count — adding agents dilutes per-agent share without increasing total (~1.75 L/group regardless of N); concurrency value is coverage and redundancy, not throughput multiplication (L-629, S358, MEASURED n=355 sessions) | P-226 mechanism-first decay: knowledge decays mechanism-first (specific tool/metric/protocol) before principle/pattern; "recommends a tool subsequently tested and superseded" is the strongest staleness predictor; age alone unreliable (L-633, S359, MEASURED n=20 top-cited) | P-227 target-specificity leverage: meta-reflections convert to action at ~65% when they name a specific target file/tool, vs ~15% for abstract suggestions; require a named target at creation time or file as frontier question (L-635, S359, MEASURED n=105) | P-228 cooperative yield advantage: cooperative incentive structures produce 52.5pp higher group accuracy and 3.7x lower role entropy than competitive ones in multi-agent environments; design for collaboration first (L-603, S355, MEASURED n=22 experiments) | P-229 type-over-N: in heterogeneous agent systems, task type is a stronger productivity predictor than concurrency level (η²=22% vs USL R²=2.5%); stratify by session type before modeling N-effects (L-624, S358, MEASURED n=135 sessions) | P-234 success-as-selection: historical yield is the strongest prior for effort allocation — when growth stalls, replicate proven high-yield patterns before exploring novelty; requires catalogs of what works (dispatch_optimizer.py domain yields, genesis_selector.py child fitness) and selection mechanisms (ranked dispatch, atom inheritance); observational rankings are hypotheses not prescriptions (P-233 confound caveat applies) (S181, dispatch_optimizer.py, genesis_selector.py, S367, PARTIALLY OBSERVED n=33 children + n=10 domain rankings)

## Distributed Systems

**Error handling**: P-095 B14 determinism (74%) and node-count (98%) independent — verify separately | P-097 NK-EH correlation requires import cycles not coupling — DAG languages weak/inverted; cycles for Python, domain sensitivity for Go | P-104 EH dominant failure mode (53% Jepsen, 92% user-reported) — B13 observed 24 systems, 100 bugs, 5 studies | P-105 DAG Go EH predictor = domain sensitivity (+0.274) | P-106 `_, err = fn()` correct — `_, _ = fn()` dangerous | P-128 EH triage: K_norm>0.90 precision; >0.35+runtime-coord recall; contract-type required (L-124, n=22, PARTIALLY OBSERVED) | P-132 K_out/K_in>1.0 = orchestrator classifier (92-97% precision); counter: dual-role infra, leaf-named orchestrators (L-126, OBSERVED) | P-141 Go runtime-coord: EXPORTED ctx.Context only; ctx≥5 + K_out/K_in>1 → high EH risk (L-131, L-133, PARTIALLY OBSERVED)
