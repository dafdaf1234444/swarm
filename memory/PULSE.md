## Frontier Questions (by signal strength)
  [1.00] F9: What should the swarm's first real-world knowledge domain be? (PA
  [1.00] F83: Can NK analysis be applied to non-Python languages at scale? Test
  [1.00] F82: Can API shape be measured? Quantify "pipeline" vs "recursive" API
  [1.00] F77: Can spawn strategy self-improve? Track spawn history, auto-tune d
  [1.00] F76: Can hierarchical spawning produce insights no single agent could?
  [1.00] F75: Does decompose-by-data outperform decompose-by-method for ALL tas
  [1.00] F71: Spawn quality — what makes a good spawn task? Measure convergence
  [1.00] F69: Context routing Level 2 — coordinator spawns with auto-summaries
