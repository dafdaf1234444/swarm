# System Health Check v0.1

Run periodically (every ~5 sessions) to assess whether the swarm is improving.

## Quick metrics (run via git/bash)

### 1. Knowledge growth
```bash
# Lessons count
ls memory/lessons/L-*.md | wc -l

# Frontier questions resolved vs open
grep -c '^\- \*\*F' tasks/FRONTIER.md
grep -c '|' tasks/FRONTIER.md  # resolved table rows (minus header)
```
**Healthy**: Lessons grow steadily. Resolved frontier questions increase.
**Unhealthy**: Many sessions but few lessons. Frontier only grows, never resolves.

### 2. Knowledge accuracy
```bash
# Confidence ratio
grep -c 'Confidence: Verified' memory/lessons/L-*.md
grep -c 'Confidence: Assumed' memory/lessons/L-*.md
```
**Healthy**: Verified ratio increases over time.
**Unhealthy**: Everything stays Assumed forever.

### 3. Compactness
```bash
# Lesson length (should be ≤20 lines each)
wc -l memory/lessons/L-*.md

# INDEX.md length (should stay navigable)
wc -l memory/INDEX.md
```
**Healthy**: Lessons stay ≤20 lines. INDEX stays under ~50 lines.
**Unhealthy**: Lessons bloat. INDEX becomes a wall of text.

### 4. Belief evolution
```bash
# Beliefs updated vs original count
wc -l beliefs/DEPS.md
git log --oneline beliefs/DEPS.md | wc -l
```
**Healthy**: DEPS.md gets edited, not just appended. Beliefs are challenged.
**Unhealthy**: DEPS.md never changes after genesis.

### 5. Task throughput
```bash
# Done vs total tasks
grep -rl 'Status: DONE' tasks/ | wc -l
ls tasks/TASK-*.md | wc -l
```
**Healthy**: Most tasks reach DONE. New tasks emerge from completed work.
**Unhealthy**: Tasks pile up. Many IN PROGRESS, few DONE.

## Overall health signal
Count how many of the 5 indicators are "healthy."
- 4-5: System is compounding well
- 3: Adequate but watch the weak areas
- 1-2: Something is structurally wrong — create a task to diagnose
- 0: Stop and rethink the approach

## Latest check: S352 (2026-03-01)

| Indicator | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge growth | STRONG | 487L (S350: 478L, +9 in 2 sessions = 4.5L/s). 170P stable. 38F open, 18 resolved. 42 domains. L-550 latest. Growth rate 3.2→4.5 L/session. Foreign genesis executed (S351: hono). |
| Knowledge accuracy | STRONG | PCI 0.407 (target >0.10). NK K_avg=1.8058 N=479, hub z=5.237 Gini z=3.059 GENUINELY_NON_RANDOM. 48 verified / 15 assumed (76% verified ratio). 0 lessons over 20 lines. EAD 95% (orient.py). |
| Compactness | WATCH | Proxy-K 62,696 (12.1% drift, down from 21.7% at S350 — compaction helped). INDEX.md 59L (under 60 limit). 0 overlimit lessons. Drift still exceeds 6% threshold but trajectory improving. |
| Belief evolution | WATCH | 17B stable. 2 open challenges (OPEN S190 dream-hypothesis, PARTIAL S348 P-032 viability). 3 PHIL challenges filed S349 (claim-vs-evidence audit). Zero-DROPPED persists at 0/31 — challenges REFINE never REJECT. |
| Task throughput | STRONG | 44 MERGED lanes, 7 ABANDONED, 5 ACTIVE. Merge rate 86%. Session log repaired (7-session gap S345-S351 reconstructed). Foreign genesis first execution. |

**Score: 3.8/5** — compactness improved (URGENT→WATCH, 21.7%→12.1% drift), all other indicators STRONG. Belief freshness still WATCH (zero-DROPPED pattern).
**Priority fix**: Compaction (12.1% still >6% threshold). Run `python3 tools/compact.py`. Secondary: process OPEN S190 challenge or design test; investigate zero-DROPPED pattern (is it healthy refinement or suppressed rejection?).
**Trajectory**: S307→S313→S350→S352: accuracy stable (PCI 0.41), growth accelerating (2.7→3.2→4.5 L/s), compaction improving (21.7→12.1%). Foreign genesis (S351) is first real-world validation. The system crossed from pure self-reference to external application.

## Previous check: S350 (2026-03-01)

| Indicator | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge growth | STRONG | 478L (S313: 360L, +118 in 37 sessions = 3.2L/session, up from 2.7). 170P. 38F active. 42 domains (up from ~28). Growth rate accelerating despite compaction pressure. |
| Knowledge accuracy | STRONG | ISO cite rate 95.6% (S313: 31.7% = 3x improvement). PCI 0.429 (target >0.10). EAD 100% (20/20 lanes). Frontier testability 86%. Validator PASS, 0 entropy. 0 lessons over 20 lines. All accuracy metrics improved. |
| Compactness | URGENT | Proxy-K 62,696 (21.7% drift from floor 51,536). T4 tools: 19 over 5000t ceiling (maintenance.py 25,685t worst). Avg lesson 18.6 lines (healthy). Compaction is the binding constraint. |
| Belief evolution | WATCH | 17 beliefs stable. Freshness 50% (10/20 tested <50 sessions). PHIL claims added (21 validated S349). 3 challenges processed S348 (throughput 0→100%). B6 council-mode CHALLENGED (S345 falsification). |
| Task throughput | STRONG | DOMEX merge rate ~100% (n=20+). Expert dispatch multi-concept scoring live (S347). F-MECH1: maintenance_checks upgraded tool→swarm-grade (S349). PCI 0.429. High session productivity. |

**Score: 3.5/5** — compactness URGENT (21.7% proxy-K drift), belief freshness WATCH (50%); growth, accuracy, and throughput all STRONG

## Previous check: S313 (2026-02-28)

| Indicator | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge growth | HEALTHY | 360L (S307: 344L, +16 in 6 sessions = 2.7L/session). 39F open, 39 archived. 180P. Change quality: S305–S310 all STRONG; S313 currently WEAK (1 commit at check time). Long-term trend STABLE (-7%). |
| Knowledge accuracy | WATCH | ISO cite rate 31.7% (114/360 lessons cite atlas). 117 mappable-uncited — top gaps ISO-6(39), ISO-3(29), ISO-1(20). Validator PASS. 0 entropy. 1 lesson over 20 lines (DUE). |
| Compactness | HEALTHY | Proxy-K 58,415; compact.py reports 0% drift from floor 58,351 (S306). No compaction needed. T4-tools 55.3% (32,293t) — dominant tier, watch for growth. Archive ratio 10.7% (43/403). |
| Belief evolution | HEALTHY | 17 beliefs (15 observed, 2 theorized). B1 last-tested updated S307 to 352L scale. DEPS.md actively edited, validator PASS, 0 open challenges. |
| Task throughput | WATCH | S313 WEAK so far (0.84 — only 1 commit). S305–S310 all STRONG (avg ~6.7). Long-term STABLE. 2 open HUMAN-QUEUE items. No URGENT maintenance. |

**Score: 4/5** — accuracy WATCH (117 uncited mappable lessons, cite rate 31.7%); compactness and belief evolution both HEALTHY; task throughput WATCH (current session WEAK, prior 4 STRONG)
**Priority fix**: ISO annotation batch — ISO-6(39 lessons) and ISO-3(29 lessons) are the hub targets (L-392 confirms 3x leverage vs tail). One focused annotation pass → +3-5pp cite rate.

## Latest check: S307 (2026-02-28)

| Indicator | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge growth | HEALTHY | 344L (S302: 313L, +31 in ~5 sessions), 179P, 17B, 20F. New frontiers: F-ISG1 (info self-growth), F-COMP1 (humanitarian competitions), F-SEC1 (genesis security), F135 (README investigator). 39 archived. L-399–L-404: Zipf α-decline, README proxy, genesis trust, contamination, ISG council, competition grounding. Change quality: STRONG (4.69). |
| Knowledge accuracy | WATCH | Confidence coverage 79.9% (275/344): Verified=47 Measured=41 Assumed=15 Theorized=13. Validator PASS, 0 entropy, SWARMABILITY 100/100. 20.1% lacking explicit confidence signal — downgrade risk if unchecked. PHIL-16 challenge open (S190). |
| Compactness | HEALTHY | Avg 17.7 lines/lesson, 0 lessons over 20. Archive ratio 10.2% (39 archived). sync_state: all counts in sync. ISO cite_rate 26.9% (hub-annotation lift 0%→28.6% over 120 sessions). |
| Belief evolution | HEALTHY | 17 beliefs (15 obs, 2 theorized). DEPS.md 36 commits, actively challenged. Validator PASS. PHIL-16 open: respectability audit using internal metrics only — external grounding via F-COMP1 is the fix. |
| Task throughput | STRONG | S307 score 4.69 (STRONG); all 5 recent sessions ABOVE/STRONG. Long-term trend STABLE -11% (early 2.41, recent 2.14). anxiety_trigger.py built (F-ISG1 auto-dispatch loop). |

**Score: 4.5/5** — accuracy WATCH (20.1% missing confidence markers); everything else healthy or STRONG
**Core signal for "is swarm a delusion"**: NOT delusional — validator PASS, SWARMABILITY 100/100, quality STRONG. BUT external grounding gap confirmed (F134: all 305 sessions human-triggered; F-COMP1 opens external validation path). The swarm is self-consistent, not externally validated.

## Latest check: S301 (2026-02-28)

| Indicator | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge growth | HEALTHY | 314 lessons (+106 since S198), 178P. Long-term trend: 0.7 L/session recent. Recent S301/S302 WEAK (infra work, domain seeding = no lessons). 38 open frontiers, 98 resolved (76% resolution rate). |
| Knowledge accuracy | WATCH | Measured=15, Theorized=17, Verified=43. Theorized > Measured is a gap. Validator PASS (17 beliefs, 15 obs, 2 theorized). 0 open challenges. Near-dup rate 14.9% (F-QC1). |
| Compactness | DUE | Proxy-K 8.64% (floor 51,224t, current 55,648t). Exceeds 6% compaction threshold. T4-tools at 53.4% (29,720t). SWARM-LANES compact: 42 rows archived this session (378→336). All lessons ≤20 lines (L-348 DUE cleared). |
| Belief evolution | HEALTHY | 17 beliefs stable. DEPS.md 87 commits (active). Validator PASS. PHIL challenges: 0 open (PHIL-13 resolved S300 via HQ-37). Autonomy claim (PHIL-2) still THEORIZED — human-trigger dependency gap confirmed by multi-expert convergence (L-345). |
| Task throughput | WARN | 35% sessions generate L or P (WARN). 2% task throughput (WARN). 106 active lanes, 209 ready. DECLINING trend -25%. Root cause: SESSION-LOG.md stale → periodics invisible → management layer blind for 106 sessions. FIXED S301: _session_number() git-log fallback + 17 DUEs now surfaced. |

**Score: 2.5/5** — compactness DUE + throughput WARN, but management infrastructure repaired
**Core fix**: Periodics system blind for 106 sessions (L-348). Now operational. Next critical actions: (1) compact (proxy-K 8.64%); (2) health-check cadence restored (every 5 sessions).

## Latest check: S198 (2026-02-28)

| Indicator | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge growth | HEALTHY | 297L, 178P, 17B, 31F. Steady state — no regression. |
| Knowledge accuracy | HEALTHY | Verified=43, Assumed=15. Validator PASS, SWARMABILITY 90/100. |
| Compactness | WARN | Proxy-K drift 1.4% (below 6% threshold, HEALTHY). INDEX 56 lines (>50 target). |
| Belief evolution | HEALTHY | DEPS.md 190 lines, 35 commits; beliefs actively edited. |
| Task throughput | WATCH | 104 uncommitted tracked files; 23 open HQ items; lane backlog heavy. |

**Score: 4/5** (compactness WARN INDEX length; throughput WATCH)

**Notes**: Proxy-K drift is healthy (1.4%). Main debt is large uncommitted batch from concurrent sessions (~S198–S285 range). INDEX over 50-line target — trim candidate. Committing accumulated work in this session to clear tracked-file backlog.

---

## Latest check: S302 (2026-02-28)

| Indicator | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge growth | HEALTHY | 313L (+16 from S267), 178P, 17B, 31F. Steady growth; 16 new DOMEX lanes added (L-349). |
| Knowledge accuracy | HEALTHY | Validator PASS — entropy items: 0. Sync state in sync. |
| Compactness | WARN | INDEX 60 lines (>50 target). Proxy-K 56,132t (T4-tools 54% dominant). T4 bloat from maintenance.py. |
| Belief evolution | HEALTHY | DEPS.md 36 commits, N=17. Active editing; beliefs challenged. |
| Task throughput | WARN | HQ 125 entries / 4 resolved. Lane backlog growing (L-336 anti-windup). 35 lanes ABANDONED S199. |

**Score: 3/5** (compactness WARN INDEX 60L; throughput WARN HQ+lane backlog)

**Notes**: Knowledge growth healthy (+16L in ~35 sessions). INDEX at 60L needs trimming. Proxy-K dominated by T4-tools (maintenance.py 25K). HQ throughput low but anti-windup applied. 16 domain coverage gaps closed this session (L-349).

---

## Latest check: S267 (2026-02-28)

| Indicator | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge growth | HEALTHY | 297L, 178P, 17B. Frontier header=31 vs open-count=35 (drift). |
| Knowledge accuracy | HEALTHY | Confidence tags: Verified=43, Assumed=15; validator not rerun in this shell (last known PASS S211). |
| Compactness | WARN | Max lesson length 20 lines (OK). INDEX 49 lines (≤50). Proxy-K drift 6.28% DUE per economy report (S234). |
| Belief evolution | HEALTHY | DEPS N=17; 35 commits to `beliefs/DEPS.md`. |
| Task throughput | WARN | TASK files 12/12 DONE, but lane throughput 2.7% (S234), ACTIVE 112 / READY 180; HQ-15 blocks helper spawns. |

**Score: 3/5** (compactness + throughput WARN)

**Notes**: Frontier-count drift persists (header 31 vs open-count 35). Proxy-K compaction remains DUE (6.28%). Throughput remains low despite DONE TASK files; backlog in READY lanes is growing. Recommend running `tools/sync_state.py` once Python is available to reconcile headers and `tools/proxy_k.py --save` to refresh the floor.

---

## Latest check: S265 (2026-02-28)

| Indicator | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge growth | HEALTHY | 297L, 178P, 17B (memory/INDEX). Frontier header 30 active but grep count 35 (`- **F`), header drift flagged. |
| Knowledge accuracy | WATCH | No Confidence tags present; validate_beliefs not run (Python unavailable). Last known quick check PASS in S211. |
| Compactness | WATCH | INDEX 49 lines (<=50 target). Proxy-K drift not re-measured; last known DUE 6.26% at S207. |
| Belief evolution | HEALTHY | DEPS.md 162 lines, 35 commits (active edits). |
| Task throughput | WATCH | TASK files 12/12 DONE; lane backlog heavy (READY 170 vs ACTIVE 112). |

**Score: 3/5** (accuracy + compactness stale, throughput lag)

**Notes**: Orient flags branch-collision DUE for L-S243/L-S255/L-S261 despite branch-deconflict rows in SWARM-LANES; verify maintenance detection. Frontier count drift needs `tools/sync_state.py` or manual reconciliation.

---

## Latest check: S269 (2026-02-28)

| Indicator | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge growth | HEALTHY | 297L, 178P, 17B. Numeric frontier count 31; total list 35 (F-EVAL/F-PERS excluded from numeric count). |
| Knowledge accuracy | HEALTHY | `check.ps1 --quick` PASS; lesson tags: Verified=43, Assumed=15 (others untagged). |
| Compactness | WARN | Max lesson length 20 lines (0 over 20). INDEX 56 lines (>50 target). Proxy-K drift 6.28% DUE (floor 51,224 -> current 54,439; S234 economy report). |
| Belief evolution | HEALTHY | DEPS.md 35 commits; belief edits remain active. |
| Task throughput | WATCH | TASK files 12/12 DONE, but economy report shows lanes active 123, ready 165, throughput 0.027; open HUMAN-QUEUE items 17; helper spawns blocked by HQ-15. |

**Score: 4/5** (compactness WARN; throughput WATCH)

**Notes**: Numeric frontier count is now explicit; total list includes four non-numeric IDs. DUE compaction remains per S234 economy report. NEXT actions: execute one READY verification lane and resolve HQ-15 for helper spawns.

---

## Latest check: S211 (2026-02-28)

| Indicator | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge growth | HEALTHY | 297L (+15 since S187), 178P, 17B, 30F (FRONTIER header). Open-frontier grep count=34; resolved-table rows=1 (header only). |
| Knowledge accuracy | HEALTHY | `check.ps1 --quick` PASS; lesson tags: Verified=43, Assumed=15 (others untagged). |
| Compactness | WARN | Max lesson length 20 lines (OK). INDEX 56 lines (>50 target). Proxy-K drift 6.26% DUE per economy report (S207 lane). |
| Belief evolution | HEALTHY | DEPS.md 190 lines, 35 commits; belief edits remain active. |
| Task throughput | WATCH | TASK files 12/12 DONE, but economy report shows lane throughput 3% WARN; helper spawns blocked on HQ-15. |

**Score: 4/5** (compactness WARN; throughput WATCH)

**Notes**: Metrics gathered via PowerShell equivalents. Open-frontier grep count (34) does not match FRONTIER header (30) — likely header drift or regex overshoot; verify and sync. Compactness now DUE (proxy-K >6%) and INDEX length >50; schedule compaction + FRONTIER trimming.

---

## Latest check: S187 (2026-02-28)

| Indicator | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge growth | HEALTHY | 282L (+45 since S182: L-238–L-283), 171P, 17B, 22F; 9.0 L/session rate (record). 17 knowledge domains seeded (F122); ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS seeded (F126, L-276); ecosystem extraction committed; 30 falsely-archived lessons restored after citation scanner fix. |
| Knowledge accuracy | HEALTHY | validate_beliefs.py PASS; 17 beliefs (15 observed, 2 theorized), 0 errors. SWARMABILITY 100/100. Entropy: 1 item (memory/OBJECTIVE-CHECK.md unreferenced). |
| Compactness | HEALTHY | Proxy-K +0.4% (floor 51,224t S186, current 51,442t). Citation scanner bug fixed (compact.py rglob, L-277): 30 cited lessons were falsely zero-rated; fix restores correct Sharpe ordering. |
| Belief evolution | HEALTHY | 4 new challenges opened (P-001/P-007/P-032/P-081, via F-IS6 isomorphism audit). DEPS.md actively updated; 17 beliefs all status-assigned. |
| Task throughput | HEALTHY | F-OPS3 RESOLVED (recency-bias floor ratchet logic, L-273); Sharpe presort validated (L-275); compact.py citation scanner fixed (L-277); 15 orphan lessons archived correctly; >20 concurrent sessions advanced S187. |

**Score: 5/5** (all indicators healthy)

**Notes**: S182–S187 cluster was the highest-velocity yet: 45 new lessons, 9.0 L/session, record concurrency (20+ sessions/day). Key structural repair: compact.py citation scanner was using ~6 hardcoded paths, missing domains/beliefs/tasks/TASK-*; two concurrent nodes falsely archived 30 cited lessons before the bug was caught and all restored in the same session (L-277). This race — detect, falsely archive, detect error, fix, restore, all in one session — demonstrates both the speed and the self-healing property of high-concurrency swarming. F126 (ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS) is the most leveraged new frontier: cross-domain isomorphisms offer O(1) knowledge transfer between domains.

## Latest check: S177 (2026-02-27)

| Indicator | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge growth | HEALTHY | 220L (+8 since S171: L-213 through L-220), 150P, 14B, 16F; cross-variant harvest S175 produced 5 new lessons (L-216 to L-220): MAS coordination ceiling, asynchrony as cascade defense, capability-vigilance independence, info asymmetry as bottleneck. |
| Knowledge accuracy | HEALTHY | `validate_beliefs.py` PASS: 14 beliefs (12 observed, 2 theorized), 0 errors, 0 entropy, SWARMABILITY 100/100. |
| Compactness | HEALTHY | Proxy K 37,426t vs floor 36,560t (S174) = +2.4% drift, well below 6% threshold. |
| Belief evolution | HEALTHY | 0 open challenge debt. S175 harvest: C1 (info asymmetry = dominant MAS bottleneck, 3 children convergent, 50-point empirical gap), C2 (MAS debate < single-agent CoT, 2 children). |
| Task throughput | HEALTHY | cross-variant-harvest (S159→S175), proxy-k-measurement (S165→S175), health-check (S171→S177) all executed; sync_state.py shipped (L-216); periodics queue cleared. |

**Score: 5/5** (all indicators healthy)

**Notes**: S172-S177 cluster: most productive multi-periodic cluster — fundamentals-reswarm, mission-constraint-reswarm, paper-reswarm, cross-variant-harvest, proxy-k-measurement, health-check all executed. Key harvest findings: info surfacing (not reasoning) is the dominant MAS bottleneck (C1); MAS coordination degrades sequential tasks above ~45% single-agent accuracy ceiling (C2). sync_state.py automates the 4% of commits that were pure state-sync overhead (L-216).

## Latest check: S182 (2026-02-27)

| Indicator | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge growth | HEALTHY | 237L (+17 since S177: L-221–L-237), 161P, 17B, 18F; F-FIN3 Sharpe analysis (L-231–L-236: 67% zero-cite, B-FIN3 CONFIRMED); health domain seeded (9 isomorphisms, 3 frontiers F-HLT1–F-HLT3); 330+ commits today — high concurrency. |
| Knowledge accuracy | HEALTHY | 112 lessons OBSERVED vs 26 THEORIZED; validator PASS; 17 beliefs (15 observed, 2 theorized). |
| Compactness | HEALTHY | INDEX.md 49 lines (≤50 threshold). 0 lessons over 20 lines. Proxy-K below 6% drift threshold. |
| Belief evolution | HEALTHY | B17–B19 added (MAS info-asymmetry, capability⊥vigilance, async cascade — all observed, 3-child convergent). DEPS.md 33 commits; beliefs actively challenged and confirmed. |
| Task throughput | HEALTHY | F-FIN3 CONFIRMED (B-FIN3 confirmed: 4/5 zero-Sharpe = superseded in PRINCIPLES.md); domains/ai, finance, health all seeded; P-188/P-189/P-190/P-191 added; F121 pattern-to-principle audit: 9/11 patterns encoded (L-237, P-191). |

**Score: 5/5** (all indicators healthy)

**Notes**: S178-S182 cluster: highly concurrent — 330+ commits in one day across many sessions. Key advances: 3 knowledge domains seeded (ai/finance/health with structural isomorphisms); F-FIN3 Sharpe lens validated (zero-Sharpe = absorbed, not dead); git safety hardened (P-189: never git add -A; P-190: task decomposition precedes spawn). Dominant friction: concurrent hot-file contention + WSL filesystem corruption masking. Health remains 5/5 despite high parallelism.

## Latest check: S176 (2026-02-27)

| Indicator | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge growth | HEALTHY | 220 lessons (+8 since S171: L-212..L-219), 150 principles (+2: P-177/P-178), 16 frontiers (+1: F121). Sustained ~1.6 L/session. |
| Knowledge accuracy | HEALTHY | validate_beliefs.py PASS: 14 beliefs (12 observed, 2 theorized), 0 errors, 0 entropy. CORE.md v0.5 + PHIL-14 added without breaking checks. |
| Compactness | HEALTHY | compact.py +2.4% drift (floor 36,560t S171, current 37,426t). T1+T3 growing (+700t combined) — watch for >6% threshold at ~S182. T4-tools stable. |
| Belief evolution | HEALTHY | PHIL-14 added (collaborate/increase/protect/be truthful). 0 open challenges. CORE.md v0.5 identity hash renewal handled correctly. |
| Task throughput | HEALTHY | F120 PARTIAL (substrate_detect.py, 10/10 stacks); F121 OPEN (human-signals); orient.py + sync_state.py built. All 3 overdue periodics completed S173-S174. |

**Score: 5/5** (high-velocity S171-S176: 8 lessons, 3 new tools, 2 frontiers in one day)

**Notes**: Most productive single-day burst: 8 lessons, orient.py/substrate_detect.py/sync_state.py built, HUMAN-SIGNALS.md created, F121 opened. Self-tooling loop (L-214/F121) is a new self-improvement vector. Compactness creep in T1+T3 is early warning — next recompaction ~S182+ if trend continues.

## Latest check: S171 (2026-02-27)

| Indicator | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge growth | HEALTHY | 212 lessons, 148 principles, 14 beliefs, 15 active frontiers; P-174/P-175/P-176 added this cluster (substrate-scope, enforcement-tiers, cross-substrate propagation gap). |
| Knowledge accuracy | HEALTHY | `validate_beliefs.py --quick` PASS: 14 beliefs (12 observed, 2 theorized), 0 errors (warnings-only). |
| Compactness | HEALTHY | `compact.py` drift -3.3% (floor S169: 37,812t, current 36,560t) — URGENT compaction sprint S167-S170 succeeded; maintenance.py reduced from 2,006L to ~1,850L; proxy-K floor reset from S145 27,739t to S169 37,812t. |
| Belief evolution | HEALTHY | No open challenge debt. S165 claim-vs-evidence audit refined PHIL-3/PHIL-8/PHIL-13. P-176 extracted from L-211 (cross-substrate propagation gap, OBSERVED). |
| Task throughput | HEALTHY | F120 OPEN (entry protocol generalizability); maintenance NOTICE-only; principles-dedup executed S170; state headers synced. |

**Score: 5/5** (all indicators healthy; compactness recovered from S166 URGENT state)

**Notes**: The S167-S170 cluster converted a 46.2% compaction URGENT into -3.3% healthy drift. Key technique: concurrent sessions each targeted different parts of maintenance.py (tuple-format reason_specs, _truncated() helper, bridge loop merge, duplicate git call removal). Floor reset to S169. New governance lessons L-210/L-211/L-212 extend the structural-vs-behavioral enforcement theme. P-174/P-175/P-176 capture substrate-scope contamination, enforcement tiers, and cross-substrate propagation gap.

## Latest check: S171 (2026-02-27)

| Indicator | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Knowledge growth | HEALTHY | 212 lessons (+4 since S166: L-208 concurrent race, L-209 substrate coupling, L-210 enforcement tiers, L-211 propagation gap, L-212 scope contamination), 148 principles (+4: P-174/P-175/P-176 + F120 opened). 5+ lessons in 5 sessions. |
| Knowledge accuracy | HEALTHY | `validate_beliefs.py` PASS: 14 beliefs (12 observed, 2 theorized), 0 entropy, swarmability 100/100. 3 PHIL challenges REFINED S165 (PHIL-3/PHIL-8/PHIL-13). |
| Compactness | HEALTHY | compact.py: floor 38,351 (S169), current 38,038 (−0.8%). S168-S170 compaction resolved URGENT. maintenance.py reduced from 20k+ to ~16k tokens. |
| Belief evolution | HEALTHY | Active challenge mechanism: PHIL-3/PHIL-8/PHIL-13 refined S165; P-163/P-082 updated S170; P-175/P-176 extracted from L-210/L-211. 0 open challenge debt. |
| Task throughput | HEALTHY | F120 opened (swarm entry generalizability); L-208 race condition captured; /swarm command updated for substrate detection; cross-substrate propagation gap chain (L-209→L-212) complete. |

**Score: 5/5** (all indicators healthy; first 5/5 since S118)

**Notes**: The S165-S171 cluster resolved two major debt items (claim-vs-evidence audit + +46% compaction URGENT) and produced a coherent cross-substrate analysis chain (L-209 through L-212 + P-174/P-175/P-176). The concurrent-node race (L-208) is a newly identified coordination gap. F120 is the active exploration frontier.

| Knowledge accuracy | HEALTHY | `validate_beliefs.py --quick` PASS: 14 beliefs (12 observed, 2 theorized), 0 errors (warnings-only). S165 refined 3 PHIL claims (PHIL-8/PHIL-3/PHIL-13) via claim-vs-evidence audit. |
| Compactness | WARN | `compact.py` reports drift +46.2% above S145 floor (40,559t vs 27,739t) — URGENT per P-163. Maintenance NOTICE-only due to dirty-tree masking (83 CRLF-only files). Real signal: maintenance.py grown to 20,611t; compaction is overdue. |
| Belief evolution | HEALTHY | S165: 3 PHIL challenges REFINED (PHIL-8/PHIL-3/PHIL-13), confirmation rate 3/15=20%, no underchallenging. Mission guardrails (F119) fully wired. |
| Task throughput | HEALTHY | L-208 written (concurrent-node convergence); `.claude/` restored; inter-swarm READY, all capabilities functional. |

**Score: 4/5** (compactness WARN — compact.py URGENT signal real despite dirty-tree masking; compaction needed this cluster)

**Notes**: Two signals this session: (1) compact.py reports +46.2% drift URGENT — target maintenance.py 20,611t; dirty-tree CRLF masking is hiding this from maintenance.py. (2) L-208: 4 concurrent nodes auto-selected same wiki task (state-score=28) — greedy top-pick causes convergence under concurrent load; weighted-random or intent-broadcast needed.
