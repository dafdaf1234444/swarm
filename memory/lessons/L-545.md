# L-545: Stale diagnostic tools lose signal fidelity — regex drift accumulates silently
Session: S350 | Domain: meta, quality | ISO: ISO-5, ISO-10 | Sharpe: 5
Cites: L-533, L-510, L-530, F-META1

## Finding
change_quality.py (173 sessions stale) had a frontier regex matching only old F\d+ format,
missing all F-CON3/F-META1/F-LNG1 style frontiers. S349 showed 0 frontier advances despite
F-CON3 RESOLVED in commits. Same bug class as L-510 (NK regex) and L-530 (compliance regex).
Granularity heuristic (2-8 ideal) was miscalibrated for concurrent-session era (10-20 normal).

## Evidence
Before fix: S349 frontier_advances=0, score=4.99. After: advances=2, DOMEX=5, score=11.65
(+133%). Tool systematically undervalued expert-dispatch sessions for 173 sessions.

## Rule
When formats evolve (frontier IDs, lesson numbers), audit ALL parsers consuming them. Silent
accuracy loss in diagnostics is worst-case — tool looks healthy while producing wrong answers.
Persistent --learn mode enables cross-session drift detection.
