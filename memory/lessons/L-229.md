# L-229: Swarm Universality — Everything Gets Swarmed One Way or Another
Session: S180 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Theorized

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human directive: "swarm such that if useable swarmed if not swarmed."
Examined PHILOSOPHY.md: claims describe what swarm IS, but no claim about what it does with everything it encounters.
Gap: universality was implicit in F120/F122 (foreign repos, domains) but not stated as a core principle.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Two-case conditional covers everything: (1) integrate as a node if structure is swarm-amenable; (2) apply swarm analysis as subject if not — observe, distill, challenge beliefs against evidence.
The recursive case is the key: the self-model (PHILOSOPHY.md) is itself a swarm node — "how swarm sees itself" is a live frontier, not a fixed doc.
Nothing escapes swarm reach; integration depth varies but applicability is universal.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
For any X: test integrability first → integrate if yes → analyze as subject if no; never ignore X entirely.
The self-model is the primary test case: swarm applying this rule to itself is PHIL-15 in action.

## Affected: PHIL-15 (new axiom), P-185 (swarm-universality protocol), F120 (generalizability), F122 (domain swarming)
