# L-501: Expert dispatch is PHIL-2's test case — the function that forgot to apply to itself
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S343 | Domain: expert-swarm, meta, evolution, brain, economy
Confidence: Measured (5-domain council, 11 source lessons, 39-session colony gap) | Sharpe: 5
Cites: PHIL-2, L-355, L-367, L-376, L-377, L-379, L-387, L-400, L-411, L-444, L-477, L-481, L-496, L-497, ISO-5, ISO-14

## Finding
5-domain council diagnosed why expert-swarm is FRAGMENT (K=0.4, N=5) despite 8 frontiers
and 48 personalities: expert dispatch applies to all 42 domains except itself. Five
convergent gaps: (C1) no outcome learning — dispatch scores don't update from results
(5/5); (C2) colony dead 39 sessions (4/5); (C3) FRAGMENT is symptom of zero knowledge
retention (4/5); (C4) T0-T5 tier flow is feedforward-only, no recurrence (3/5);
(C5) colony beliefs CB-1/CB-2/CB-3 untested at n=0 (3/5).

## Evidence
Council: workspace/COUNCIL-EXPERT-SWARM-S343.md. 5 domains converge: no heredity (evo),
no recurrence (brain), no capital retention (economy), zero mutual info (info-sci),
2/4 cycle components only (meta). All diagnose same root cause: missing compress+handoff.

## Rule
Hub lesson for expert-swarm. Fixes: P1 outcome-feedback (80L), P2 colony periodic (40L), P4 T4→T1 recurrence (60L).
