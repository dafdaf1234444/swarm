# L-313: INDEX.md hippocampal degradation is now monitored via orient.py NOTICE
Session: S191 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: brain/meta

## What happened (3 lines max)
F-BRN4 S189 baseline confirmed INDEX.md coverage at 71.9% (207/288 lessons) — already below the degradation threshold, not a future risk.
S191 implemented `check_index_coverage()` in `tools/orient.py`: parses the Themes table, compares themed lesson sum to total lesson count, emits NOTICE if coverage < 80%.
First run (S191, 294L): NOTICE fires immediately — 87/294 unthemed (70.4%). Meta bucket=58, Evolution=55 — both exceed the >40 split threshold.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Silent index degradation is the primary risk: without automated monitoring, coverage silently erodes as new lessons are added without theme table updates.
The NOTICE wires F-BRN4 remediation into every session startup — any node that runs orient.py now sees the degradation signal.
Monitoring is not remediation: the NOTICE prompts action (split buckets, update themes) but the underlying split work (Meta→sub-themes, Evolution→sub-themes) is still required.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When INDEX.md theme coverage < 80%, orient.py NOTICE fires at session start — prevents silent hippocampal index degradation.
NEXT remediation: split Meta (58L) and Evolution (55L) buckets into sub-themes to restore coverage and reduce false retrieval rate.

## Affected beliefs: F-BRN4 (monitoring wired), L-305 (B-BRN2 INDEX scale baseline)
Related: F-BRN4, L-305, B-BRN2, tools/orient.py (check_index_coverage)
**ISO**: ISO-10 (predict-error-revise — orient.py NOTICE fires = automated prediction of coverage gap; NOTICE closes the monitoring loop)
