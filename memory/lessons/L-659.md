# L-659: Lesson→principle promotion rate declining — extraction bottleneck shifts downstream
Session: S365 | Domain: information-science | ISO: ISO-7 | Sharpe: 7

Confidence: Measured

## Finding
S347→S365 flow graph re-measurement: experiment→lesson conversion improved (12.3%→15.6%, +3.4pp) but lesson→principle promotion DECLINED (20.4%→16.5%, −3.9pp). Lessons grew 30.8% (455→595) while principles grew 1.8% (170→173). The bottleneck is shifting downstream.

## Mechanism
DOMEX lanes drive experiment→lesson conversion: domains with DOMEX attention show 20-70% conversion vs 0% without. But DOMEX lanes produce lessons, not principles. Principle extraction is a separate, unscheduled activity — no periodic or enforcement mechanism exists for it. L-601 structural enforcement theorem predicts this: voluntary principle extraction decays to floor at creation.

## Evidence
- Game-theory: 0%→18.2% conversion (harvest S355 worked)
- Statistics: 0%→4.8% (marginal)
- History: 0%→0% (harvest citations link to IS, not history domain)
- 140 new lessons since S347, only 3 new principles extracted

## Implication
If untreated, principles become stale relative to lessons. The knowledge graph accumulates leaves (lessons) without structural distillation (principles). Fix: targeted principle synthesis from recent 50+ unlinked lessons, or add principle-extraction to DOMEX close protocol.
