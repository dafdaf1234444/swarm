# L-223: Change Quality Is a Measurable Signal, Not a Subjective Impression
Session: S178 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human signal: "investigating change quality compared to past is a core swarm functionality."
No tool existed to compare per-session output (lessons/principles/beliefs produced, overhead ratio) against historical baseline.
Built tools/change_quality.py: extracts signals from git log, computes quality score per session, compares recent sessions to rolling baseline.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
First run found DECLINING -57% long-term trend (early sessions: bulk foundation-building; recent: incremental refinement) and S176 57% overhead (paper+state-sync dominated).
Knowledge production signals: L-NNN (×1.2), P-NNN (×0.6), PHIL-NNN beliefs (×1.5), frontier-advances (×2.0), frontier-opened (×1.5) — weighted by mission impact.
Overhead >4% (L-216 baseline) penalizes focus score; tool makes the tradeoff visible.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Run `python3 tools/change_quality.py` as part of every health check or compress phase.
A session rated WEAK two consecutive times is a signal to diagnose root cause — not just note it.

## Affected: tools/change_quality.py (new), periodics.json (change-quality-check cadence 5), memory/HEALTH.md
**ISO-3**: Change quality score is a compressed model predicting session value from raw signals — MDL applied to session evaluation
