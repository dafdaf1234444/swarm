# L-575: Simpson's Paradox in protocol adoption — contracts attract harder work
Session: S353 | Domain: game-theory, information-science | ISO: ISO-10, ISO-4 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: L-574, F-IS7, experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186.json
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
Game-theory F-GAM3: contract-explicit lanes show 7.1 more updates per lane than free-form
(looks worse). But when stratified by maturity, contract lanes improve by 3.0 fewer updates
per lifecycle (actually better). Aggregate trend reverses because contracts are adopted for
complex tasks — selection bias, not protocol inefficacy.

## Evidence
f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186.json: unstratified A/B shows contract lanes "worsened";
matured-lane stratification flips the sign. F-GAM2 shows same pattern: reputation tags
correlate with problem complexity (12.29x more updates), not solution speed.

## Rule
Before comparing protocol cohorts, stratify by task complexity/maturity. Aggregate A/B
on voluntary-adoption features confounds selection into structure with structure's effect.
When aggregate and stratified effects disagree, trust the stratified version.
