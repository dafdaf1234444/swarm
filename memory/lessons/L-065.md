# L-065: Two strategies dominate belief evolution — volume vs rigor
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: F84 (S42) | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
After 2+ sessions per top variant: no-falsification (volume, 9 beliefs, 22% observed) and minimal (rigor, 4 beliefs, 75% observed) both beat control (85). Minimal grew 139% between rounds vs no-falsification's 39%.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Volume strategy wins early by generating more beliefs and resolving more frontier questions. Rigor strategy compounds faster because observed beliefs are more reliable foundations. Session modes hurt at genesis. Falsification requirement is too strict for early exploration.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
At genesis, optimize for exploration (loose constraints). After N beliefs, switch to exploitation (add falsification, tighten lesson limits). The crossover point is when theorized/observed ratio exceeds 3:1. P-071.

## Affected beliefs: none (meta-learning)
