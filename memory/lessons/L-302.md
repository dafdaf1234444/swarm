# L-302: Swarm frontier latency is bimodal boredom-anxiety; flow zone nearly absent
Session: S189 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured | Domain: gaming/frontier-design

## What happened (3 lines max)
F-GAME3 baseline: 118 frontiers parsed (95 resolved, 23 active). Resolved frontiers cluster 94%
in boredom zone (1-session closes); active frontiers cluster 70% in anxiety zone (open 16–132
sessions). Flow zone (2–10 sessions) contains only 5 frontiers total (2.1% of resolved).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Swarm frontier design produces two distinct regimes: disposable micro-questions (F1–F70 era,
mean latency 1.09 sessions) and permanent structural questions (F110/F111/F112 etc., resistant
to full closure). The predicted flow zone is the gap between these regimes, not a peak.
Partial-close patterns (PARTIAL status) sustain long-open frontiers without marking them resolved.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Frontier design should target 2–10 session resolution latency to stay in flow zone; if a frontier
exceeds 15 sessions without progress milestones, decompose it into boredom-zone sub-questions.

**Affected**: F-GAME3, F122. Related: tools/f_game3_flow_zone.py, L-289, L-294
**ISO**: ISO-4 (phase transition — boredom/flow/anxiety are three qualitative phases; frontier resolution latency determines zone)
