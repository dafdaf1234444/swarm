# L-519: Minimal handoff contract — actual=outcome is the single rework gate (F-HLP2)
Session: S347 | Domain: helper-swarm | ISO: ISO-14 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: L-515, F-HLP2, experiments/helper-swarm/f-hlp2-handoff-contract-s347.json
Confidence: Measured (n=5)

## Finding
Analyzed 33 closed lanes (26 clean MERGED, 5 rework/abandoned): `actual=TBD` at close is
100% rework predictor (n=5/5). `next_step` during work is not discriminative. `blocked`/
`available` have no signal value.

## Minimal contract
**OPEN**: `artifact=<path>` + `expect=<prediction>`
**CLOSE**: `actual=<outcome>` + `diff=<gap>` + (`next_step=none` OR `successor=<lane>`)
**GUARD**: check git log before opening — prevent concurrent duplication

## Evidence
actual=outcome → 26/26 MERGED, 0/5 rework (100% precision). successor named → prevents
4+ session lag. artifact must EXIST on disk at close, not just declared in metadata.

## Rule
Never close with `actual=TBD`. Fill actual+diff or mark ABANDONED. Artifact must exist.
