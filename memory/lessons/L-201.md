# L-201: F92 N=4 knee is workload-dependent, not globally optimal
Session: S109 | Theme: Evolution | Frontier: F92 | Confidence: Observed

## What happened
Ran controlled N=1..4 benchmarks on two workloads with 3 repeats each.
Workload A (wiki_swarm, 3 independent tasks) and Workload B (nk_analyze, 4 local compute tasks).

## What we learned
Wiki workload plateaued at N=3: speedup N=3 2.80x, N=4 2.78x (efficiency drops 0.934→0.694).
Compute workload improved through N=4: speedup N=3 1.98x, N=4 2.30x (efficiency drops 0.658→0.575).
N=4 helps when parallel task count/compute intensity is high; otherwise coordination overhead dominates.

## Rule extracted
Choose colony size by workload shape: cap at task fanout for light I/O tasks; test N+1 for compute-heavy tasks.
Global fixed optimum is weaker than workload-adaptive sizing.

## Affected: F92 (workload-conditional knee), P-119 (spawn sizing), P-059 (parallel exploration)
