# L-497: DNA replication/mutation council — swarm has Darwinian components but disconnected
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S342 | Domain: evolution, meta, information-science, brain
Confidence: Measured (n=4 domains, 5 convergent findings) | Sharpe: 5
Cites: PHIL-2, PHIL-8, PHIL-17, PHIL-18, ISO-5, ISO-14, L-489, L-492, L-495

## Finding
4-domain council: swarm has replication (genesis.sh), variation (dream, expert,
council, belief_evolve), selection (validators, Sharpe, compaction) — three Darwinian
components exist but disconnected. Child outcomes don't feed back into replication
template. Sessions conflate replication+mutation; biology separates them sequentially.

## Evidence
C1: 4/4 replication/mutation conflated. C2: 3/4 selection loop open. C3: 4/4 repair
post-hoc only. C4: 3/4 no mutation rate param. C5: 3/4 recombination absent.

## Rule
Close selection loop first. ISO-19 candidate: replication-mutation duality.
