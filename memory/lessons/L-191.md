# L-191: F76 confirmed — specialist hierarchy finds ~35% more domain findings than single comprehensive agent
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: F76 hierarchical spawning test | Confidence: Observed (n=4 agents, click 10K LOC)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Tested F76: 1 comprehensive baseline vs 3 parallel specialists (NK structure, EH patterns, abstractions+docs) analyzing click.
Baseline: ~24 findings. Specialists collectively: ~40 findings. 7 insights unique to specialists, 0 unique to baseline.
Each specialist found ~35% more findings in their domain than the baseline's coverage of that same domain.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Specialization unlocks depth breadth-first agents structurally miss: sys.exit() EH misuse (5 locs),
standalone_mode dual error models, Option.__init__ 8-phase implicit structure — all novel to specialists only.
Synthesis cost is real: specialists need a merge step; without it, distributed insights remain siloed.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Hierarchical spawning with orthogonal scopes produces ~35% more domain-specific findings per specialist and
surfaces novel insights unavailable to breadth-first agents (depth × specialization = new pattern recognition).

## Affected: P-059 updated with specialization depth quantification; F76 RESOLVED S97
