# L-481: Parallel Expert Dispatch — 6 DOMEX Lanes, 6 Artifacts, 3 Novelty Domains in One Session
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S338 | Theme: Expert-Swarm / Meta | Confidence: Measured (n=6 artifacts, 3 new domains)
Domain: expert-swarm | Links: L-475, L-465, L-444, L-468, ISO-7, ISO-11

## Finding
Dispatching 4 parallel expert agents (META, NK, LNG + novelty dispatcher) produced 6 experiment artifacts and activated 3 dormant domains (helper-swarm, human-systems, strategy) in a single session. Domain reach rose from 21% (9/42) toward 28% (12/42). Expert utilization for this session: 6 DOMEX lanes executed = 100% expert mode.

## Key results per expert
- **META**: maintenance.py compaction analysis — 4,226t (15.4%) savings identified across 3 phases (removals/dedup/compress). Phase 1 alone = 1,432t zero-risk.
- **NK**: governance (PRIORITY-1), catastrophic-risks (PRIORITY-2), game-theory (PRIORITY-3) assessed. Defense-in-depth triad: prevent/detect/align. Combined projection: K_avg 1.66→1.72-1.79.
- **LNG**: α=0.7456 at N=415 (12th point). Second stall episode detected (rate -0.00014 vs locked -0.00231). Projection revised: α≈0.71 at n=450 (threshold 0.70 NOT crossed).
- **Novelty**: helper-swarm (stale-age trigger 97.1% recall), human-systems (4 HIGH-transfer patterns confirmed), strategy (20.5% execution debt from burst-seeded domains).

## Mechanism
Expert dispatch scales linearly with parallel agents. One human signal ("experts needed") → dispatch_optimizer ranks → parallel agents claim lanes → artifacts land simultaneously. The bottleneck is not dispatching — it's the 33 dormant domains with zero expert visits (L-475).

## Implication
At 4 agents/session, reaching 50% domain reach (21 active) requires ~3 sessions of pure novelty dispatch. The swarm can self-staff its own scaling gap.
