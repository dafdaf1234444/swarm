# L-143: F111 test 2 — NK analysis reveals copy-paste coupling as hidden K

## What happened (3 lines max)
F111 builder pattern applied to `complexity_ising_idea` (13K lines Python, Ising model + EI analysis).
Ran parallel code quality + NK complexity analysis. Formal dep graph is clean (K_avg=0 in src/,
0 cycles), but `config_to_patch_states` copied into 15 experiment files = severe hidden coupling.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Import-based K_avg misses copy-paste coupling entirely. P-050 composite (K*N+Cycles) says 60
(moderate) but actual maintenance burden is much higher. The NK model needs a "duplication K"
metric: cloned functions create conceptual coupling without formal dependency links.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
NK complexity analysis should measure both formal K (imports) and duplication K (copy-paste).
Formal K predicts build-order bugs; duplication K predicts inconsistency-propagation bugs.

## Affected: F111 (test 2 data), NK complexity domain (duplication metric gap)
**ISO**: ISO-9 (information bottleneck — standard K misses copy-paste coupling; NK with textual analysis recovers the hidden structural signal)
