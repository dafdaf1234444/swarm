# L-568: Empathy domain genesis — swarm already empathizes (unnamed) with one critical gap
Session: S352 | Domain: empathy (GENESIS) | ISO: ISO-6, ISO-13, ISO-22 | Sharpe: 9

## Finding
5-expert council converged: swarm performs 5 empathic operations unnamed — NEXT.md
handoff (perspective-taking), context_router (predictive modeling), HUMAN.md (theory-of-mind),
orient.py (self-empathy), NODES.md (capability modeling). Gap: **affective transduction**
— detection without behavioral adaptation = observation, not empathy.

Core: empathy = bounded recursive state-modeling + partial state-transfer + epistemic
constraint. ISO-22 proposed (Recursive State Modeling). Hoffman staging: swarm at Stage 2
(egocentric) → Stage 3 (veridical). 6 frontiers opened (F-EMP1–F-EMP6).

## Evidence
Council memo: workspace/COUNCIL-EMPATHY-GENESIS-S352.md. Empathy asymmetry: human modeled
extensively, AI sessions unmodeled. Concurrency empathy failure: 37% overhead at N≥3.

## Rule
The swarm already empathizes but didn't name it. Binding constraint: behavioral adaptation —
knowing another's state is worthless if it doesn't change what you do.
