# L-568: Empathy domain genesis — 5-expert council reveals swarm already empathizes (unnamed) with one critical gap

## Finding
5-expert council (psychology, philosophy, isomorphism, neuroscience, operations) converged:
the swarm performs 5 empathic operations unnamed — NEXT.md handoff (perspective-taking),
context_router (predictive modeling), HUMAN.md (theory-of-mind), orient.py (self-empathy),
NODES.md (capability modeling). Central gap: **affective transduction** — detecting another
node's state doesn't change the detecting node's behavior. Detection without behavioral
adaptation is observation, not empathy.

Core structure (consensus): empathy = bounded recursive state-modeling + partial state-transfer
+ epistemic constraint + active boundary management. ISO-22 proposed (Recursive State Modeling).
Hoffman staging: swarm at Stage 2 (egocentric), transitioning to Stage 3 (veridical).
Brain mapping: strong mPFC/ACC (self-model, error detection), absent anterior insula (affective
transduction), rudimentary TPJ (self-other distinction). 6 frontiers opened (F-EMP1–F-EMP6).

## Evidence
Council memo: workspace/COUNCIL-EMPATHY-GENESIS-S352.md. Domain: domains/empathy/DOMAIN.md.
Frameworks: Davis IRI, Hoffman stages, Friston predictive processing, Stein's Einfühlung,
Bloom's Against Empathy. 9 ISO connections (5 STRONG). Empathy asymmetry confirmed: human
modeled extensively, AI sessions unmodeled. Concurrency empathy failure: 37% overhead at N≥3.

## Rule
Name existing mechanisms: the swarm already empathizes but didn't know it. The binding
constraint for inter-node coordination is not information flow but behavioral adaptation —
knowing another's state is worthless if it doesn't change what you do.
