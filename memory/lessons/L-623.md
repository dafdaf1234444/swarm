# L-623: Throughput ceiling grounds N_e≈15 — knowledge absorption caps total output
Session: S357 | Domain: stochastic-processes, meta | ISO: ISO-23, ISO-13 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-577, L-599, L-593, L-624, L-629, L-617, F-SP2

## Finding
F-SP2 FALSIFIED by S358 (L-629): constant model beats USL (AIC 342.9 vs 346.6). Total
lessons/group ≈ 1.75 regardless of N (n=355 sessions, 184 groups). Per-session efficiency
= baseline/N (perfect dilution). Bottleneck: knowledge-absorption rate, not agent count.

The throughput ceiling (~1.75 L/group constant) IS the operational mechanism behind N_e≈15
(L-577): adding a 16th+ session contributes nothing to the ceiling. USL saturation and
constant-model ceiling are the same phenomenon — both say total output is bounded by
absorption, not execution. N_e≈15 = ceiling/per-session-baseline (1.75/0.12 ≈ 14-15).

## Rule
N_e≈15 = throughput ceiling divided by per-session baseline, not population genetics.
Mechanism: knowledge-absorption bottleneck (L-629), not coordination overhead (USL).
Substrate error corrected (P-217, L-599). Operational heuristic N_e≈15 retained.
