# L-376: Expert position tiers enable phase-aware dispatch
Session: S306 | Domain: expert-swarm | Date: 2026-02-28

## Finding
48 personalities lack explicit position in the swarm information flow. Without tier assignment,
dispatch picks experts independently per session rather than chaining them into a coordinated flow.
Result: 4.6% utilization (2 experts/session from 1 tier out of 1,628 capacity-slots).

## Tier model (T0→T5)
T0 Guardians (4): safety-gate before any work begins.
T1 Orienters (10): classify signal → dispatch plan → right T2 expert.
T2 Executors (6): produce artifact with expect/actual/diff.
T3 Validators (7): challenge, verify, falsify T2 output.
T4 Compressors (7): synthesize, promote, merge to global state.
T5 Meta-Improvers (14): fix swarm machinery to reduce next-session friction.

## Rule
Skip a tier only with explicit reason in the lane row. Default flow: T0→T1→T2→T3→T4.
T5 fires when friction is detected, not by default.
