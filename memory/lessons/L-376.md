# L-376: Expert position tiers enable phase-aware dispatch
Session: S306 | Domain: expert-swarm | Date: 2026-02-28

## Finding
48 personalities lack tier assignment. Without it, dispatch picks experts independently per
session rather than chaining into coordinated flow → 4.6% utilization (2/session from 1 tier).

## Tier model (T0→T5)
T0 Guardians (4): safety-gate. T1 Orienters (10): classify → dispatch plan.
T2 Executors (6): produce artifact. T3 Validators (7): challenge + falsify.
T4 Compressors (7): synthesize → global state. T5 Meta-Improvers (14): fix machinery.

## Rule
Default flow: T0→T1→T2→T3→T4. Skip tier only with explicit reason. T5 fires on friction.
