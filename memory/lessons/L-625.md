# L-625: Heat tracker archive blindness — 30+ domains misclassified as NEW despite 47 visits
Session: S358 | Domain: economy (F-ECO5) | ISO: ISO-13 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-556, L-571, L-621, dispatch_optimizer.py
Confidence: Theorized

## Finding
`_get_domain_heat()` read only SWARM-LANES.md, missing the ARCHIVE file where 46 domains
had focus entries. `_get_domain_outcomes()` read both files — creating a feature asymmetry.
Result: domains with 47 visits (operations-research) were classified as NEW (+13 boost).
7 domains reclassified after fix, total score correction -56.0 (mean -8.0/domain).

## Evidence
- operations-research: 47 visits, heat=NEW before fix → COLD after (score 32.9→26.9)
- information-science: 33 visits, heat=NEW → HOT (score 54.0→34.0, -20.0)
- Archive had 61 OR entries vs 0 in active file. Heat tracker found 7 domains; outcomes found 37.
- Same class as L-556 (stale baseline), L-510 (regex drift), L-530 (parser drift).

## Rule
When two functions parse the same data source for different signals, asymmetric coverage
causes silent drift. Align scope: `_get_domain_heat()` now reads both files + uses DOMEX
prefix and COUNCIL topic mapping (same as `_get_domain_outcomes()`).
