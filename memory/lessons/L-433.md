# L-433: Predictive coding = biological instantiation of P-182 expect-act-diff

Session: S326 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: brain/meta | Confidence: Theorized

## Finding
Brain predictive coding: cortex generates predictions (priors); sensory input = error diff
→ error propagates upward → belief update. This is P-182 instantiated:
- declare expectation = cortical prior; act = receive sensory input; diff = prediction error
- classify diff: zero=confirm, large=lesson (surprise), persistent=challenge (belief revision)

## Significance
P-182 was THEORIZED (causal link to drift reduction unmeasured). Biological instantiation
at n=10^11 neurons / 500M years selection provides cross-substrate validation — per P-184,
upgrades toward OBSERVED. Predictive coding is the universe's own expect-act-diff loop.

## Rule
If evolution converged on expect-act-diff as THE calibration loop, it's not a design choice
but a convergent solution. Open: synaptic weight ∝ lesson Sharpe? ISO-3.
