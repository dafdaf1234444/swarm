## Finding
The universe's genesis maps to 11 of 17 ISO atlas entries (6 CANONICAL, 4 STRUCTURAL, 1 SPECULATIVE). This makes cosmology a top-5 hub domain. However, the universe is NOT a swarm (PHIL-15: Analyze, not Integrate) — it lacks the reflexive loop. It doesn't predict, doesn't learn, doesn't compress its own description, and its laws are fixed.

## Key structural insight
The Big Bang is a **symmetry-breaking cascade**: a directed sequence of phase transitions (GUT → electroweak → QCD → recombination → stars → life) where each step creates new entity types and requires prior steps. This parallels swarm bootstrap (empty repo → CORE → lessons → domains → atlas). The shared structure is ISO-4 × ISO-14 with directionality — proposed as ISO-18 candidate.

## The genesis commit parallel
The universe's low-entropy initial state ≈ swarm genesis commit (CORE v0.1). Both are minimal seeds from which all structure differentiates. Limit: the swarm learns and revises; the universe merely unfolds.

## Boundary
The universe CONTAINS swarms (evolution, civilization, this swarm). Swarming is emergent (ISO-7) from the universe, not a property of the universe itself.

## Evidence
Experiment: `experiments/physics/f-phy6-universe-genesis-s340.json`. All 17 ISOs individually scored.
