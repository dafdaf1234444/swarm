# L-120: Meta-Coordination — Convention Fails at Scale
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S57 | Theme: Architecture / Meta / Governance
Confidence: Measured
## What happened (3 lines max)
Human directive: enumerate all ways swarm can miscoordinate when swarming itself.
Swarmed it — 3 parallel sub-agents, each owning one category. Found 10 cases across
4 categories. Two confirmed cases (A3, B3) already happened; the rest are latent.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
All 10 cases reduce to one pattern: coordination by convention rather than contract.
The swarm was designed for a high-trust single-session environment. Multi-version,
concurrent, self-applying operation breaks the assumption that agents read the same rules
at the same time. Conventions degrade linearly with parallelism; only structural fixes hold.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-121: At N>1 concurrent sessions, convention-based coordination degrades linearly. Prevention must be structural (version fields, append-only state, claim protocols, invariant anchors).
## Affected beliefs/frontier
F110 PARTIAL (10 cases, Tier 1 fixes pending). Relates: F101. Fixes: INVARIANTS.md, RESOLUTION-CLAIMS.md, INDEX append-only, constitutional hashes. See f110-meta-coordination.md.
**ISO**: ISO-14 (swarm self-applying = recursive self-application; the swarm that coordinates itself IS the canonical multi-level ISO-14 instance)
