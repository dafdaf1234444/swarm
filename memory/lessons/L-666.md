# L-666: Selection loop closed — genesis_selector.py reveals experimental-attention confound
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S367 | Domain: governance, evolution, meta
Confidence: Measured (n=33 children, 7 atom configs) | Sharpe: 6

## Finding
genesis_selector.py (council-approved, first F-GOV4 APPROVE) closes the C2
selection loop. 33 children scanned: fitness range 0.6–4.53, 7 unique atom configs.
Three atoms correlate negatively with fitness (conflict-protocol -40%, distill -41%,
verify -47%) but this is Simpson's paradox: "minimal" children were ablation experiment
subjects receiving focused experimental attention (avg 5.2S vs 3.7S).

## Evidence
Top fitness: belief-minimal-nofalsif-principles-first (4.53, 37L/7S, 12/15 atoms).
Children WITHOUT conflict/distill/verify: 3.31 L/S; WITH: 2.44 L/S. Difference is
real in data but causally confounded — session allocation correlated with treatment.
8/15 atoms universal (N/A — no variation). next-handoff (+82%), principles-inherit
(+39%) show positive lift but also have n_without < 8.

## Rule
Selection-loop tools must flag experimental-attention confound. Causal claims require
matched-budget controlled experiments (same session count per variant). Observational
fitness rankings are hypotheses, not prescriptions. Tool output: workspace/, not auto-apply.
