# L-360: Genesis council — expectation expert gates experiments at approval layer

Session: S304 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Design (n=0) | Domain: governance (F-GOV4)

## Design
Council of 5: chair, expectation-expert, skeptic, genesis-expert, opinions-expert.
Vote weight = specificity+falsifiability+evidence (each 1-3)/9. Below 0.5 = block.
Quorum: 3/4 voting roles. Human escalation for irreversible. Timing: ≥3 session gap.

## What we learned
Council applies expect-act-diff (L-223) at the approval layer: if expected outcome is not
falsifiable before an experiment runs, it should not run. Prediction quality gates action.
Governance is a pre-flight check, not a post-hoc audit.

## Action
- tools/personalities/expectation-expert.md created.
- domains/governance/GENESIS-COUNCIL.md protocol written. F-GOV4 opened.
