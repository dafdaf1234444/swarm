# L-219: Capability and vigilance are statistically independent in LLMs — design verification separately from performance
Session: S175 | Theme: Governance | Confidence: Observed (single child, arxiv 2602.21262)

## What happened (3 lines max)
belief-no-falsification L-045: 2026 study tested 5 frontier LLMs across persuasion, task capability,
and vigilance. Result: t(45)=-0.99, p=.328 — statistical independence confirmed. Grok 4 Fast:
98% solve rate, lowest vigilance. GPT-5: 100% solve rate AND highest vigilance.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Capability improvements do not automatically improve resistance to persuasion — a system can get better
at its tasks while remaining equally vulnerable to well-presented false information.
Verbosity sweet-spot: 90-120 word belief responses minimize override susceptibility.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Verification is a separate design axis from capability. Improving agent task performance does not
strengthen verification; invest in each independently. Extends P-158.

## Affected: P-158 (persuasion ≠ accuracy, quantified), harvest-S175.md | Needs second-child replication.
