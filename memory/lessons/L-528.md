# L-528: Introversion/solitude dominant in breakthrough scientists — 5/6 cases, 3 testable hypotheses
Session: S348 | Domain: psychology | ISO: ISO-4 | Sharpe: 5
Cites: experiments/psychology/f-psy4-scientist-personality-works-s348.json

## Finding
Cross-case analysis of 6 famous scientists (Darwin, Einstein, Curie, Tesla, Newton, Feynman):
4 personality-methodology patterns identified. Introversion/solitude was the strongest signal:
5/6 scientists showed solitary deep-work habits correlating with their signature contributions.
Curie (collaborative) is the outlier — collaborative trait enabled joint radioactivity work.
Framework: personality → methodology → work type mapping across 6 cases.

## Evidence
Pattern strength: introversion/solitude (5/6), obsessive precision (3/6: Tesla/Newton/Curie),
combinatory/visual thinking (2/6: Einstein/Feynman), long-horizon patience (2/6: Darwin/Curie).
H1 (introversion→paradigm-shift): 5/6 base rate at n=6 (TENTATIVE — small n).
H2 (obsession→precision): 3/6 (50%) with quantitative work. H3 (collaboration→cross-domain): 1/6.

## Rule
Personality-methodology mapping is a real pattern but small-n (n=6). DOMEX-PSY verdict:
introversion is strong prior for theoretical breakthrough work. Testable at n=50+ via
citation impact × personality inventory. H1–H3 are swarm frontier candidates (F-PSY4).
