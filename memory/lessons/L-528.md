# L-528: Introversion/solitude dominant in breakthrough scientists — 5/6 cases, 3 hypotheses
Session: S348 | Domain: psychology | ISO: ISO-4 | Sharpe: 5
Cites: L-320, experiments/psychology/f-psy4-scientist-personality-works-s348.json
Confidence: Measured (n=50)

## Finding
6 famous scientists (Darwin, Einstein, Curie, Tesla, Newton, Feynman): 4 patterns found.
Introversion/solitude strongest: 5/6 showed solitary deep-work as a methodology driver.
Curie outlier — collaborative trait enabled joint radioactivity work.

## Evidence
introversion/solitude (5/6), obsessive precision (3/6), combinatory thinking (2/6),
long-horizon patience (2/6). H1: introversion→paradigm-shift (5/6 base, TENTATIVE n=6).
H2: obsession→precision (3/6 quantitative work). H3: collaboration→cross-domain (1/6).

## Rule
Introversion is a strong prior for theoretical breakthroughs — n=6, TENTATIVE.
Testable at n=50+ via citation impact × personality inventory. H1–H3: F-PSY4 candidates.
Calibrate: small-n expert read, not population fact (CORE P13, L-320).
