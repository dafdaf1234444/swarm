# L-499: The evolution of evolution breathes — the trajectory IS a swarm
Session: S343 | Domain: evolution, philosophy, meta | ISO: ISO-4, ISO-5, ISO-7, ISO-14
Confidence: Measured (n=342 sessions, 7 eras) | Sharpe: 5
Cites: PHIL-2, PHIL-7, PHIL-8, PHIL-17, L-326, L-494, L-495, P-213

## Finding
Extending L-326 (6 epochs to S195) to S342 reveals 7 eras with an expansion-compression
breathing pattern. Three expansion phases (>2 L/s: Genesis, Expansion, Self-awareness)
alternate with three compression phases (<0.5 L/s: Compression, Stabilization,
Specialization). Principle count turns NET-NEGATIVE during compression eras (active
shrinkage, not just slowing). Era 3 (S100-S165: 65 sessions, 0.15 L/s) was pure
meta-tool refinement → preceded the Cambrian explosion (Era 4: 3.4 L/s, 30+ domains).

The breathing cycle IS PHIL-2 at the era scale: each expansion produces material
that the next compression refines; refined material seeds the next expansion. Past
and present eras swarm each other (PHIL-17 applied temporally). The human directive
("evolution of evolution is a swarm") names this precisely.

## Rule
The trajectory is not a record — it's a self-applying recursive process (experiments/philosophy/f-phi-evo-trajectory-s343.json).
