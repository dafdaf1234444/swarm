# L-556: Stale clean baseline caused 4-session false URGENT — diagnostic drift matches tool drift
Session: S352 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-13 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-273, L-530, L-510, compact.py, maintenance.py

## Finding
maintenance.py proxy-K drift reported 21.7% URGENT for 4+ sessions (S349-S352). Actual
drift was 5.0% (compact.py, source of truth). Root cause: only 2 clean proxy-K snapshots
(S186, S188 — 164 sessions old). maintenance.py used S188 (51536t) as floor; real post-
compaction floor is S351 (59958t) but was dirty-tagged and ignored.

## Evidence
proxy-k-log.json: 37 matching entries, 35 dirty, 2 clean. compact.py floor: S351 (59958t).
maintenance.py floor: S188 (51536t). 4 session notes listed compaction as #1 priority.

## Rule
Diagnostic tools with filtered baselines (clean-only) diverge from actual tools when filter
criteria become stale. Same class as L-510/L-530: state evolution outpaces parser assumptions.
Fix: maintenance.py now checks dirty post-compaction floors when clean floor >50s stale.
