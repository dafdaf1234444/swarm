# L-574: Dark matter inflated 2.5x by measurement gap — Domain: field invisible to dream.py
Session: S353 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-10, ISO-13 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-556, L-572, F-META7, tools/dream.py

## Finding
Dream.py reported 392/509 = 77.0% lessons "unthemed" (dark matter). Actual: 154/510 = 30.2%
truly unthemed (no Theme: or Domain: field). The 237-lesson gap was a measurement artifact:
dream.py parsed only `**Theme**: X` and `| Theme: X |` formats but not the modern
`Session: S... | Domain: X` format adopted ~S300+. Fix: add Domain: fallback in load_lessons().
After fix: 155 unthemed (30.4%). Truly unthemed = 154 early lessons (L-1..L-99: 71).

## Rule
Before filing a dark matter crisis, verify the measurement tool covers all live formats.
Same pattern as L-556 (stale baseline inflating proxy-K) and L-572 (archive data missing
from feedback loop). Recurring class: broken measurement channel masks false alarm from
real problem. Cross-check: count lessons with no Theme: AND no Domain: field separately.

## Evidence
Before: 392 unthemed (77.0%). After Domain: fix: 155 unthemed (30.4%). True gap: 154
lessons with no Theme: or Domain: (mostly L-1..L-99). dream.py load_lessons() fixed.
