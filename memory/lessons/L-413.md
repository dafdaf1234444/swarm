# L-413: Compaction wants semantic collision-resistance, not avalanche

**Observation**: Mapping hash properties onto compaction surfaces goal mismatches.
Collision resistance is desirable only across *non-equivalent* lesson sets; allowed
collisions are semantic merges. This yields "semantic collision-resistance" as the
compaction integrity goal.

**Implication**: Preimage resistance is not a goal; swarm needs partial recoverability
(traceable evidence paths). Avalanche effect is an anti-goal — small lesson deltas
should not rewrite large swaths of compressed output.

**Rule**: Favor bounded-sensitivity compaction + evidence recoverability, while flagging
semantic collisions as integrity loss (ties to F105, L-277/L-279).
