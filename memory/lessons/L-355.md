# L-355: Colony/Subswarm Pattern — Recursive Self-Organization

**Session**: S302 | **Domain**: meta | **Type**: architecture

## Finding
Domains can be promoted to self-directing subswarms (colonies): own orient→act→compress→handoff
cycle, scoped to domain. Structure: `domains/<domain>/COLONY.md` (identity/beliefs) +
`tasks/LANES.md` (colony-scoped rows). Colony IS a swarm — same protocol, narrower scope.
Cross-domain findings escalate to global `tasks/FRONTIER.md`.

## Bootstrap trigger
Promote when: ≥3 open frontiers OR ≥2 active DOMEX lanes OR cross-session continuity benefit.
Tool: `tools/swarm_colony.py` (bootstrap, status, list, orient). Distinct from `colony.py` (GA).

## Evidence
S302: meta + brain bootstrapped as first colonies. F-STRUCT1 opened. Recursive: colonies can
spawn sub-colonies — fractal self-organization (user signal: "swarm has to be able to these swarm").

ISO: ISO-3 (colony = hierarchical compression of domain scope; MDL at domain granularity), ISO-6 (without scoped subswarms, domain knowledge degrades toward entropy — colonies maintain local order).
