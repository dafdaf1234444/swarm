# L-006: The 3-S Rule — Search if Specific, Stale, or Stakes-high
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: TASK-006 / F6 | Confidence: Assumed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Categorized 8 types of knowledge an LLM might need and assessed training data reliability for each.
Refined the initial heuristic ("verify if specific, recent, or high-stakes") into the 3-S Rule.
Created memory/VERIFY.md with decision flow and common traps.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Three dimensions cover most verification needs: specificity, staleness, stakes.
The biggest trap is version conflation — training data merges info across versions of the same tool.
When search isn't available, mark confidence as Inherited and note what needs checking.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Apply the 3-S Rule before asserting facts: is it Specific? Is it Stale? Are Stakes high? If any yes, verify or mark Inherited.

## Affected beliefs: none
