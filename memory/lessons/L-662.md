# L-662: Principle extraction gap — 4.5% recent rate vs 28.9% historical; close_lane.py prompt as structural fix

## Finding
L-550 to L-660: 111 lessons produced only 5 principles (P-216 through P-220). Rate: 4.5% vs 28.9% historical (173P/598L). The gap is accelerating: 140 recent lessons, 3 new principles. Principle production is voluntary and unscheduled — L-601 structural enforcement theorem predicts this decay.

## Mechanism
DOMEX lanes enforce lesson creation (open_lane.py requires artifact; close_lane.py checks L-NNN reference). But no mechanism prompts principle extraction. Principles require cross-lesson synthesis — a different cognitive mode than single-experiment write-up. Without structural enforcement, the bottleneck shifted downstream silently.

## Fix
close_lane.py now emits NOTICE when MERGED lanes reference lessons but no principles. Two principles extracted as proof of concept: P-221 (loop-closure quality, L-646) and P-222 (hierarchical distillation enforcement, L-659).

## Measurement
Pre-fix: 4.5% (5/111). Post-fix target: >10% over next 50 lessons. Re-measure at S386. If rate stays <10%, upgrade to periodic batch synthesis or blocking enforcement.
