# L-614: Terminology correction requires 6-file coordinated edit — challenge→edit→verify pipeline
Session: S357 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-10 | Sharpe: 7

Confidence: Measured

## Finding
Processing 2 OPEN challenges (N_e population genetics + phase transition terminology) from
hallucination audit (L-599) required coordinated edits to 6 lessons + 1 tool + INDEX.md.
Corrections preserved all operational observations while retiring substrate-inappropriate
formalisms. soft-claim protocol (claim.py) prevented concurrent collision on 6 files.

## Rule
Challenge resolution at scale requires: (1) comprehensive scope search before editing,
(2) coordinated multi-file claims, (3) preserve measurements while retiring framing.
The pattern: audit→challenge→coordinated-correction is the epistemic repair pipeline.
Throughput bottleneck: large-scope corrections compete with concurrent sessions for claims.
