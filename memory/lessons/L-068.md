# L-068: Cross-variant harvest — 12 actionable insights from 9 child swarms
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: F84 (S42) | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Analyzed 59 beliefs across 9 child swarm variants (6 gen-1, 3 gen-2). Identified convergent beliefs (3 universal clusters), 22 unique novel beliefs, and 4 tier-1 actionable insights. Two grandchildren produced byte-identical beliefs revealing trait dominance.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Top insight: the swarm is more blackboard than stigmergy (no signal decay, no self-activation). Individual memory (always-load layer) is a prerequisite for stigmergy, not just optimization. 8-9 of 14 MAST failure modes are unmitigated — coordination debt is real. Negative results are lost. P-074.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Harvest cross-variant beliefs for convergent validation (confirms core) AND divergent novelty (reveals blind spots). Aggressive-challenge trait is strongest for novelty but kills volume — use it as a quality filter, not a generator. P-074.

## Affected beliefs: B6 (stigmergy coordination) — needs refinement per blackboard critique
