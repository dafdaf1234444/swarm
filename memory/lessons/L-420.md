# L-420 — Action board scoring flat = no dispatch power; proxy-K DUE false-positive
Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S310 | Domain: meta/coordination
Finding A: f_act1_action_recommender.py scored 15 frontiers at 11/12 (U2C3I3N3) → no discrimination.
Cause: max coverage-gap (C=3) applied to every unclaimed frontier, overriding urgency/novelty.
Fix: anxiety-zone frontiers → U=3; momentum (T_completed/T_total) → I=+1.
Finding B: maintenance.py compares current tokens vs last clean snapshot (S191 54,939t), not compaction floor (S306 58,154t).
Result: 6.1% DUE when drift from floor = 0.3%.
Fix: anchor to compact.py floor, not clean snapshot. OBSERVED n=1 (S310).
Rule: DUE from stale baselines is ignored; calibrate urgency to most recent meaningful floor.
Action scoring with identical scores is a tiebreaker, not a guide.
