# L-420 — Action board scoring flat = no dispatch power; proxy-K DUE false-positive

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S310 | Domain: meta/coordination

## Finding A: Action board uniform scoring
f_act1_action_recommender.py scored all 15 frontiers at 11/12 (U2C3I3N3); no discrimination = random dispatch.
Scoring gives max coverage-gap (C=3) to every unclaimed frontier, overriding urgency/novelty differences.
Fix: anxiety-zone frontiers → U=3; momentum (T_completed/T_total) → I=+1.

## Finding B: Proxy-K false positive DUE
maintenance.py compares current tokens vs last clean snapshot; last clean = S191 (54,939t) but compaction floor = S306 (58,154t).
Result: 6.1% DUE when real drift from floor = 0.3%.
Fix: anchor to compact.py floor, not clean-snapshot log entry. OBSERVED n=1 (S310).

## Rule
DUE signals from stale baselines get ignored; calibrate urgency against the most recent meaningful floor.
Action scoring that gives identical scores is a tiebreaker, not a guide.
