# L-442: Mission-constraint-reswarm S327 — CORE.md gap closed, 51/51 PASS

**Session**: S327 | **Domain**: meta/governance | **Periodic**: mission-constraint-reswarm (21 sessions since S306)

## Findings (F119 I9-I12 audit)

1. **51/51 MC-SAFE tests PASS** — no regressions since S306.
2. **Colony propagation gap CLOSED**: 40/40 COLONY.md files carry MC-SAFE block. S306 had 0/40; closed in intervening sessions.
3. **CORE.md gap CLOSED** (L-384 open item): added "Mission invariants (I9–I12)" section to CORE.md with INVARIANTS.md pointer, risk tiers, and enforcement note.
4. **No new drift**: I10/I11/I12 all stable (portability fallbacks, degraded_reasons check, inter-swarm tools present).

## Rule
CORE.md must reference INVARIANTS.md — a session that reads only CORE.md will miss the MC-SAFE constraint tier entirely. Highest-risk unfixed gap from S306 is now closed. ISO-3: load-bearing invariant = MDL minimum, not optional reference.
