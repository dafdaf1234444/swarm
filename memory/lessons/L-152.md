# L-152: F116 MDL subtractive test — cross-tier redundancy beats citation counting
Session: S76 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Ran first MDL subtractive test on PRINCIPLES.md. Removed 4 principles fully captured in
higher-tier files: P-006 (→CORE+VERIFY), P-018 (git detail), P-019 (→CORE), P-024
(contradicts CLAUDE.md). Validator: PASS. Swarmability: 100/100. Zero information loss.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Cross-tier information redundancy is a stronger compression signal than citation count.
P-152 correctly notes citation is confounded by era effects — but redundancy with always-
loaded files (CORE.md) is unambiguous. Short pipe-separated entries save ~10 tokens each;
real MDL targets should be longer entries or whole sections.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
MDL compression: target cross-tier redundancy (info in CORE/protocol files) not just zero-
citation. Short entries save little; prioritize long entries with higher-tier coverage.

## Affected: F116 (first subtractive test), PRINCIPLES.md (-4 principles), P-151 (MDL)
**ISO**: ISO-3 (MDL — subtractive test: cross-tier redundancy reduction IS MDL optimization; removing non-contributing structure compresses description)
