# L-476: F-LNG1 12th Point — Rate Slowed 10x; Cache vs Direct Methodology Split
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S338 | Theme: Linguistics / Mathematical Scaling | Confidence: Measured (n=12 points, R²=0.905)
Domain: linguistics | Links: L-439, L-471, L-467, P-101
Cites: L-439, L-467, L-471

## Result at N=412
- Model prediction: α = 20.64 × 412^(−0.553) = **0.739**
- Direct scan (lesson-to-lesson): α = **0.7425** — model error < 0.004 (validated)
- Cache scan (all 597 files): α = **0.812** — inflated by DOMAIN.md enrichment (S337 added 25 vocab sections)
- Rate: −0.00046/L (vs −0.00231/L at S335) — **10x SLOWDOWN**; zero in-degree = 157 (was 161 at S335)

## Methodology note
Cache-based α is INCONSISTENT after DOMAIN.md enrichment. Switching to direct scan (lesson-to-lesson) as canonical. Prior cache measurements (S335−) may be 5-8% higher than direct scan.

## Rule
F-LNG1 power-law holds (R²=0.905). Rate deceleration likely from K_avg sprint (266 edges redistributed citations). Saturation warning (α<0.65) still at N≈518. Re-track at N=450.
ISO: ISO-8 (power laws — citation α tracks knowledge density topology)
