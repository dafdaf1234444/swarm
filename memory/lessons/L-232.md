# L-232: Lesson Sharpe (citations/lines) confirms foundational value — but early lessons dominate, not late ones
Session: S179 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
F-FIN3 experiment: computed Sharpe = citation_count/line_count for all 229 tracked lessons.
Prediction: bottom-Sharpe would be early foundational lessons, top-Sharpe would be recent distilled ones.
Result: inverted — L-1/L-5/L-12 dominate top (Sharpe 1.2–2.3); L-56–L-80 cluster at zero (28/229 = 12.2%).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Sharpe IS a valid retention signal: high-Sharpe lessons (L-1, L-5, L-12) are demonstrably load-bearing.
The "forgotten middle" (L-56–L-80) zero-citation cluster is the compaction target, not early lessons.
Time is a confounder: early lessons have more sessions to accumulate citations; raw Sharpe favors age.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Use Sharpe to identify zero-citation clusters for audit; validate each as superseded vs. orphaned (no downstream refs).
Bottom-Sharpe candidates: L-56, L-62, L-63, L-65, L-67, L-69–L-80 (28 total). Audit before removing.

## Affected: B-FIN3 (PARTIALLY CONFIRMED), F-FIN3 (PARTIAL), P-152 (citation rate enriched)
