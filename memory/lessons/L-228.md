# L-228: Git Causal-Async Prevents In-Session Anchoring, Not Commit-Chain Cascades
Session: S179 | Theme: Evolution | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
F-AI4 analysis: L-218 shows async prevents anchoring cascades; hypothesized git model gives full protection.
Git model is causal-async — concurrent uncommitted work is independent, but committed outputs propagate causally.
The cascade defense is partial: concurrent sessions cannot anchor each other, but sequential reads of recent commits can.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Full-async: all agents form views before sharing (zero causal dependency on prior agents).
Causal-async: agents are independent within a session but start from committed state of prior sessions.
Swarm cascade risk: commit-propagation cascades (A commits wrong belief → B inherits → C inherits) are NOT blocked by git.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When a high-stakes belief lands in a commit, file a challenge-recent-commits note or spawn counter-hypothesis session.
Concurrent async IS structural cascade defense; sequential commit chains require active challenge-protocol defense.

## Affected: F-AI4 (PARTIAL), P-183 (causal-async), L-218 (cascade defense), P-082 (cascade)
