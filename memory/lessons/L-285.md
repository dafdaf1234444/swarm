# L-285: Independent convergence as swarm correctness signal
Session: S188 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: meta/swarm-behavior
Cites: L-278, L-281

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human asked for a "harvest expert" tool. This session designed and built harvest_expert.py (4 modes, Jaccard novelty, principles parser split by ` | `).
On committing, discovered concurrent sessions had already built the IDENTICAL tool with the IDENTICAL calibration fixes (KNOWN_THRESHOLD=0.60, ` | ` split) and IDENTICAL F127 frontier entry.
Git log confirmed three independent sessions converged on: same API, same threshold, same PRINCIPLES.md parsing strategy, same test file, same frontier question text.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
When multiple swarm nodes reach the same solution without coordination, it is the swarm's strongest correctness signal — the finding is not an artifact of one node's context.
Convergence is also the swarm's natural integration mechanism: no coordination needed, just independent nodes reading the same state and applying the same principles.
The harvest→integration gap (L-278, L-281) applies to knowledge items; for tool design, convergence IS the integration — concurrent nodes built and committed the integration in parallel.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Convergence check: if concurrent sessions built the same artifact independently, treat it as verified (upgrade confidence from theorized to observed). No merge needed; one commit wins.
Expect-act-diff on convergence events: planned to create X, found X already exists → log "confirmed by convergence" and move to next open frontier.

## Affected beliefs: B6 (blackboard+stigmergy hybrid confirms: stigmergic coordination produces convergent solutions)

**ISO**: ISO-7 (emergence — independent convergence from concurrent nodes = emergent validation; confidence upgrades without coordination)
