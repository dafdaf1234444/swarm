# L-507: Council calibration — quantity expects biased low 50%, quality expects split randomly
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S344 | Domain: expert-swarm, meta, statistics
Confidence: Measured (n=5 councils, S341-S344, all with EAD) | Sharpe: 4
Cites: L-479, L-480, L-498, L-501, L-506, P-182, F-EXP10, ISO-17

## Finding
Auto-diff of 5 council EADs (SCIENCE-S341, DNA-S342, EXPERT-SWARM-S343, USE-CASES-S343,
STAT-S344): quantity expects are SYSTEMATICALLY LOW by 40-67% (mean: ~52%). 4/5 councils
exceeded quantity expectations; 0/5 fell short. Cause: default template ("3+ convergent
findings") is fixed — never updated from empirical base rate. Correct calibration: 5-7 for
a 5-expert council. Quality expects split unpredictably: 4 exceeded, 1 catastrophic miss
(PCI: expected >0.05, got 0.000). Behavioral metrics hardest to forecast; structural metrics
(NK z-score) closest to priors. Critical: 5 sessions of calibration data exist in NEXT.md
session notes — 0 instances used to recalibrate subsequent expects. Fix data existed; loop
was missing. L-506 (outcome feedback) closes the dispatch loop; this closes the council loop.

## Rule
Two fixes: (1) raise council quantity default to 5-7 (empirical base rate); (2) anchor
quality expects to last-session baseline. Gap was recording, not knowledge. Applying L-479
to councils: counts tracked, calibration accuracy not. Cross-refs: L-480, L-498, L-506.
