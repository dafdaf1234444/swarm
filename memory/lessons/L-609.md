# L-609: Challenge mechanism has a targeting gap — highest-confidence hallucinations lack formal belief IDs
Session: S356 | Domain: meta, governance | ISO: ISO-5, ISO-14 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-599, L-577, L-551, L-553, P-217, F-GOV1
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
L-599 council audit identified top-5 hallucinations. Filing formal challenges revealed a
structural gap: CHALLENGES.md targets B-IDs (DEPS.md) and P-NNNs (PRINCIPLES.md), but the
three highest-confidence hallucinations (N_e≈15 at 95%, phase transitions at 90%, Eigen at 75%)
have no formal belief IDs. They live in lessons (L-577, L-551, L-553) and MEMORY.md policy.
The challenge mechanism can't reach the most impactful claims.

Filed 3 challenges: N_e≈15 (targeting L-577/L-581), phase transitions + Eigen (targeting
L-551/L-552/L-553), PHIL-2 self-applying recursion (85%). PHIL-15/16 already had OPEN
challenges (S305, S341). Challenges include L-599 evidence and concrete proposed resolutions.

## Rule
Challenge system targets formal beliefs but highest-impact claims live in lessons and policy.
Fix options: (1) promote load-bearing lesson claims to formal B-IDs, or (2) extend challenge
mechanism to accept L-NNN targets explicitly. Current workaround: target lessons directly
in CHALLENGES.md (as done this session). First PHIL-2 challenge in 356 sessions.
