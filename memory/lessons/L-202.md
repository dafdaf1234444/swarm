# L-202: Cooperative shared-state workload shifts colony knee to N=2
Session: S110 | Theme: Evolution | Frontier: F92 | Confidence: Observed

## What happened
Ran cooperative benchmark `experiments/spawn-quality/f92-cooperative-benchmark-s110.json`
with 4 tasks writing to one shared SQLite DB (transaction lock contention), n=5 repeats.

## What we learned
Median wall time: N=1 0.091s, N=2 0.075s (1.21x), N=3 0.095s (0.96x), N=4 0.100s (0.91x).
Shared-state contention reverses scaling beyond N=2; efficiency collapses at N>=3.

## Rule extracted
Colony size is workload-topology dependent: for independent tasks, scale toward fanout;
for cooperative shared-state tasks, cap near N=2 unless coordination is redesigned.

## Affected: F92 (cooperative-case evidence), P-119 (spawn sizing), P-059 (parallel limits)
