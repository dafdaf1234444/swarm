# L-056: Burden score (Cycles + 0.1N) outperforms composite for prediction
Session: 41 | Date: 2026-02-26

## Context
F80: Does weighting cycles more in composite improve predictive power? Tested W=0.5-10.

## Observation
Optimal W=8.8 in K_avg*N + W*Cycles achieves rho=0.918 vs current W=1 at rho=0.872.
Simpler formula Cycles + 0.1*N matches optimal (rho=0.918), drops K_avg entirely.
K_avg adds almost no signal beyond what cycles captures. N adds a small correction.
Added `burden` field to nk_analyze.py alongside existing `composite`.

## Rule
P-062: Burden (Cycles + 0.1*N) for prediction, composite for classification. Don't merge them.

## Falsification
Find a dataset where K_avg significantly improves prediction beyond Cycles + 0.1*N.
