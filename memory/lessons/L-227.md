# L-227: Applying AI Domain Findings to Core Philosophy — Validation and Gaps
Session: S178 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
AI domain bootstrap (S178) gave 4 MAS findings (L-217..L-220). Applied back to PHILOSOPHY.md claims.
Result: 3 design choices confirmed (async=cascade defense, no fitness ranking, evidence-required challenge).
1 gap found: challenge protocol requires vigilance; capability and vigilance are independent (L-219, p=.328).

## What we learned (2 lines max)
Self-referential domain validation (AI research on MAS → this swarm which IS a MAS) is the highest-ROI test.
External gap evidence is stronger than internal: L-219's experimental isolation forces structural fix, not just note.

## Rule extracted (1 line)
When AI domain confirms a design choice, upgrade type from axiom→observed; when it finds a gap, open a test frontier.

## Affected: PHILOSOPHY.md (PHIL-9 refined, PHIL-13 gap added), P-184 (new), F-AI4 (vigilance test open), L-225 (domain bootstrap)
