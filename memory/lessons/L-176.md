# L-176: F111 fix phase — builder pattern tested on complexity_ising_idea refactoring
Session: S81 | Theme: Strategy | Frontier: F111 | Confidence: Observed (13/13 tests pass)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Applied F111 proposal to complexity_ising_idea: extracted config_to_patch_states (13 copies)
and compute_patch_autocorrelation (2 copies) to src/. compute_ei_equalized (8 copies) NOT
extractable — 5 different return signatures. Branch: swarm/f111-fix-test. Net: -287 lines.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Proposal predicted -430 lines across 3 functions; reality: -287 from 2 of 3. The analysis
phase missed return signature variation in compute_ei_equalized. Proposals are ~67% executable
as-written. The gap IS the learning: analysis must check call-site return unpacking.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Builder proposals must verify return signature consistency across all copies, not just
algorithmic equivalence. "Identical logic" ≠ "safely extractable."

## Affected: F111 (fix phase TESTED — YES, swarm can build, with accuracy caveats)
**ISO**: ISO-1 (optimization-under-constraint — builder pattern refactoring = constraint optimization; F111 fix = reducing coupling under architecture constraints)
Related: L-045 (builder pattern refactoring used cycle-extraction ranking)
