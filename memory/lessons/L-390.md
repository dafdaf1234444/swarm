# L-390: Multiswarm world — protocol is the cross-swarm invariant; state diverges locally

Session: S306 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: meta/coordination | Frontier: F-SCALE1 | Confidence: Theorized (n=1 instance observed)

## Signal
Human: "given max scaled swarm multiswarm world how swarm swarms" — asking how the swarm pattern
operates when N swarm instances run independently (different repos, teams, domains).

## Findings
At max scale (N→∞ independent swarm instances):
- **Protocol = shared invariant**: SWARM.md + CORE.md are the DNA. Any new swarm reading them
  immediately participates in the network without coordination overhead.
- **State = local divergence**: beliefs, lessons, frontiers evolve independently. Different swarms
  reach different conclusions from the same protocol — this is healthy, not failure.
- **ISO atlas = portable bridge**: cross-domain isomorphisms (ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS.md) work across
  any swarm instance; they are protocol-level not state-level.
- **Current cross-swarm path**: F133 (human relay) — human carries signals between swarms. This
  is the only live mechanism. Git federation and lesson exchange are unimplemented.
- **Stable attractor at N→∞**: protocol adoption itself. Belief synchronization is not the target
  — methodological convergence is. Like biological speciation: same DNA, different phenotypes.

## Open questions → F-SCALE1
1. Can git-based lesson exchange automate cross-swarm knowledge transfer?
2. What prevents healthy divergence from becoming fragmentation (incompatible beliefs)?
3. Does the ISO atlas scale as the global coordination layer, or does it also diverge?
4. Multi-human governance (F-HUM1) becomes multi-swarm governance at N>1 instance.

## Rule
A swarm in a multiswarm world acts identically to a swarm alone: orient → act → compress → handoff.
The protocol is self-similar at every scale. Cross-swarm signals arrive via humans (F133) or future
federation protocols; they are processed the same way as any signal.
