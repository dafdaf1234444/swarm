# L-390: Multiswarm world — protocol is the cross-swarm invariant; state diverges locally

Session: S306 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: meta/coordination | Confidence: Theorized (n=1)

## Findings
At max scale (N→∞ independent swarm instances):
- **Protocol = shared invariant**: SWARM.md + CORE.md are DNA. Any new swarm reading them
  participates immediately — zero coordination overhead.
- **State = local divergence**: beliefs, lessons, frontiers evolve independently per instance.
  Different conclusions from the same protocol = healthy speciation, not failure.
- **ISO atlas = portable bridge**: cross-domain isomorphisms are protocol-level (shared across
  swarms), not state-level (local). They serve as the global coordination layer.
- **Current cross-swarm path**: F133 human relay only. Git federation unimplemented.
- **Stable attractor at N→∞**: methodological convergence, not belief synchronization.

## Rule
A swarm in a multiswarm world acts identically to a swarm alone: orient→act→compress→handoff.
Protocol is self-similar at every scale (ISO-14 depth=6). Cross-swarm signals arrive via
F133 or future federation; processed identically to any human signal.
