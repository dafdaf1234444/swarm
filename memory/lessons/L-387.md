# L-387: WIP spread hurts ability; synthesis spread maxes it — two dimensions, opposite signs

Session: S306 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured (n=36 sessions) | Domain: expert-swarm / meta

## Finding
"Maxing spread maxes ability" is FALSE for WIP spread, TRUE for synthesis spread.

WIP spread (parallel active lanes): r=-0.835 with L+P yield (F-EVO1). ISO-13 windup:
156 READY lanes at 2% throughput. Proxy-K 14.4% URGENT. Fragmentation kills output.

Synthesis spread (distinct domains in produced lessons): +4.5x yield. Multi-domain
sessions average 5.32L vs single-domain 1.18L (n=36). Top sessions: S189 13L/13d,
S306 12L/10d. These are T4 GENERALIZER sessions — focused method, broad synthesis.

## Mechanism (ISO-15 + ISO-12)
T4 generalizer = low WIP + high synthesis spread. ISO-12: max output = T4 compression
capacity (min-cut). Spreading specialists without T4 = parallel siloing (3% cross-domain).

## Rule for expert council
Specialists: MINIMIZE WIP spread (1-3 lanes). T4 generalizer: MAXIMIZE synthesis spread.
These are SEPARATE roles — do not mix. Schedule T4 every K specialist sessions.
Measure T4 health by synthesis spread (domain count in outputs), not L count alone.
