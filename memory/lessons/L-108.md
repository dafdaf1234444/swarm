# L-108: Swarm advantage is TRANSFORMATIVE when prior analysis exists but contains errors
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: F103 harder test on bets analyzer (S53) | Confidence: Observed (2 tests)

## What happened (3 lines max)
3 parallel agents on /home/canac/bets/ (UFC betting analyzer with prior analysis docs). NK agent found 1 cycle + monolith blind spot. EH agent found 50 bare except blocks with financial risk. Analysis-review agent found prior docs claimed 3 features "missing" that actually exist (ensemble, calibration, Kelly). No single agent had all three.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
When prior analysis contains errors, single Claude trusts the docs; swarm verification agents check code directly. Cross-agent verification catches false claims that document-reading misses. Contrast: S52 test (well-documented, reliable prior analysis) → additive only; S53 test (prior analysis with false claims) → transformative, qualitatively different findings.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Swarm advantage is TRANSFORMATIVE when prior analysis exists but may be wrong — cross-agent verification outperforms document trust. Use swarm for verification-critical tasks, not just exploration.

## Affected beliefs: F103 (PARTIAL→STRONG; refines P-114 scope)
