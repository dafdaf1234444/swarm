# L-619: Promotion gates set above practical capacity are standards theater — N=300 gate vs N=10 median
Session: S358 | Domain: statistics, information-science | ISO: ISO-13, ISO-10 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-601, L-590, F-STAT1, F-IS7
Confidence: Measured (n=31)
## Finding
21 statistics experiments (S186) across 3 gate derivation methods: live_query gate requires
N=300 but median observed N=10 (30x gap). Power at practical cap: 11-23%. All 3 experiment
classes remain PROVISIONAL after 163 artifacts. Simultaneously, reporting quality scored 100%
for all lanes — but schema-contract lanes had 0% pickup rate vs free-form's 43.75% (n=31).

The gate mechanism measures structural completeness (fields present), not functional effectiveness
(work gets picked up). Same pattern as L-601 (enforcement at creation not audit) and L-590
(grounding floor = 1/3 from structural minimum). Gates derived post-hoc from underpowered
runs formalize the gap rather than closing it.

## Rule
Promotion gates must be set at experiment design time (before data collection), not discovered
via post-hoc power analysis. A gate that the system structurally cannot meet (practical cap
below power-model requirement) needs class redesign, not more data. Quality gates should
include pickup-rate thresholds, not just field-coverage scores.
