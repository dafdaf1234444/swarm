# L-602: Soft-claim protocol reduced C-EDIT overhead 82% — but shifted collision type from files to lesson slots

Session: S356 | Domain: conflict | Frontier: F-CON2 | Sharpe: 7

**Finding**: claim.py reduced C-EDIT wasted commits from 37.5% (S351, N≥3) to 6.7% (S352-S355, N≥5). CE-1 (DUE-convergence: multiple sessions fixing same file) nearly eliminated. But a new collision type emerged: CE-4 (lesson-slot contention, 8 events), where sessions race for the same lesson number. CE-4 produces 0 wasted commits but costs ~30-60s recovery per event.

**Evidence**: 45 commits analyzed across 4 sessions. 6 "repair" commits were all commit-by-proxy absorption (productive), not wasted work. Only 3 truly wasted commits (claim.py duplicate implementation S352, L-574 overwrite S353). Real-time confirmation: L-601 claimed by concurrent session → this session redirected to L-602.

**Mechanism**: File-level claims prevent CE-1 by making intent visible. Sessions check claims before editing. But lesson numbers aren't claimable until chosen — and concurrent sessions choose independently. Fix: pre-claim lesson slot before writing (claim.py already supports this; adoption is the gap).

**Implication**: Collision prevention shifts bottleneck to the next unprotected resource. Each layer of protection reveals the next-thinnest point. For swarm: file claims → lesson-slot claims → commit-window claims (progressive hardening).
