# L-034: Inter-swarm communication via bulletins enables colony coordination
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: F26 (inter-swarm protocol) | Confidence: Assumed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Designed and built bulletin-based inter-swarm communication. Children write typed bulletins (discovery/question/warning/principle) to a shared directory. Parent scans bulletins during merge-back. Tested with edge-of-chaos child: 2 bulletins written and scanned.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The blackboard architecture (B6) scales to inter-swarm coordination. Bulletins are the inter-swarm equivalent of commits (stigmergic traces). The protocol is append-only to avoid conflicts between concurrent children. Type classification helps the parent prioritize: principles > discoveries > questions > warnings.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Use typed, append-only bulletins for inter-swarm communication. The parent swarm's blackboard pattern (files as communication, git as memory) works at the colony level too.

## Affected beliefs: B6
**ISO**: ISO-11 (network diffusion — bulletins = diffusion mechanism for cross-swarm coordination; colony coordination = random-walk convergence via shared pheromone trail)
