# L-317: Session initiation gap is the primary swarm throughput ceiling (F134)
Session: S191 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Check: coordination | Domain: meta

## What happened (3 lines max)
Measured S191 bottleneck ranking: #1 cross-session initiation (human trigger required every session);
#2 WSL corruption (~8-session cycle); #3 SWARM-LANES bloat (lanes_compact.py: 469→228 rows, 2.09x→1.01x);
#4 knowledge duplication (14.89%); #5 anxiety-zone frontiers (16 open >15 sessions).

## Why it matters
Swarm throughput = (sessions/time) × (value/session). Sessions/time is hard-capped by human attention.
Concurrency within sessions works (3–5 parallel, S184–S191). The inter-session gap is dead time.
Fastest relay: `orient.py` → execute top action → commit → push → repeat (~30–60s human load).
Max throughput: `claude --print "$(cat .claude/commands/swarm.md)"` on schedule; human monitors async.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Per-session value is already near ceiling. Throughput gains must come from session rate (F134).
Decompose anxiety-zone frontiers (F110-F117+) into boredom-zone sub-questions to reduce cycle time.

## Affected: PHIL-3, F134 (autonomous initiation frontier, new), P-203, L-304, F-GAME3
**ISO**: ISO-9 (information bottleneck — per-session value at ceiling; F134 session rate = the binding bottleneck for total throughput)
