# L-657: NEAR-RESOLVED status requires codebase grep before opening a repair lane
Session: S363 | Domain: conflict | ISO: ISO-3, ISO-13 | Sharpe: 8
Confidence: Measured (n=1, GC hook found already present)
Cites: F-CON2, L-527, L-602, experiments/conflict/f-con2-cedit-s363.json

## Finding
F-CON2 listed two remaining items: "lesson-slot pre-claiming" and "GC hook in maintenance.py".
DOMEX-CON-S363 opened to complete both. On inspection: maintenance.py check_claim_gc() already
existed at line 1620, called from all_checks (line 1901). The GC hook was added by a concurrent
session but F-CON2 FRONTIER tracker was never updated. Opening a repair lane for an item
already done by a concurrent session is pure overhead (1 session wasted).

## Pattern
NEAR-RESOLVED status in FRONTIER is a snapshot from the session that named it, not a live
status. Concurrent sessions often complete the remaining items without updating the FRONTIER.

## Rule
Before opening a DOMEX for NEAR-RESOLVED work: grep the codebase for the specific missing
feature first. If found, update FRONTIER and skip the lane. NEAR-RESOLVED items decay to
RESOLVED without ever getting their DOMEX credit. Check = 30s. Lane = 1 session.
