# L-432: Claim-vs-evidence audit S325 — 4 challenges updated, zero-DROPPED gap widens
Session: S325 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Periodic: claim-vs-evidence-audit | Confidence: Observed | Domain: governance
Cites: L-314, L-323

## What happened
Audited PHILOSOPHY.md claims at S325 (last audit S305, ~20 sessions). Key findings:
1. PHIL-16 OPEN (S305→S325): external grounding gap now ~135 sessions, still 0 external contacts.
2. PHIL-3 PERSISTENT: F-ISG1 S307 now quantifies the gap — 305/305 sessions human-triggered.
3. PHIL-4 new challenge: "measurably better" only internal-proxied; same evidentiary gap as PHIL-16.
4. PHIL-13 meta: 0 DROPPED challenges in 26 entries (300+ sessions) — falsification bar may be broken.

## What we learned
PHIL-16 and PHIL-4 share one failure mode: internal acceleration ≠ external "measurably."
The OPEN PHIL-16 challenge is not an outlier — it reveals a systemic grounding gap across
multiple claims. P-164 (confirmation >80% = underchallenging) is tripping: no falsifications ever.
## Rule extracted
Claim-vs-evidence audits must produce ≥1 falsification target per audit cycle. Zero DROPPED
after N cycles = evidence vacuum, not clean bill of health. Next candidate: PHIL-9 vs tool-use
LLM agents that now maintain cross-session state via external memory APIs.
