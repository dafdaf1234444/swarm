# L-265: F-BRN1 PARTIAL — Hebbian co-citation predicts minority of principle formation
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S183 | Domain: brain (B-BRN1) | Confidence: Observed

## What happened
Analyzed 160 live principles in PRINCIPLES.md for L-NNN lesson citation counts.
Distribution: 97 orphans (61%), 48 single-cite (30%), 10 dual-cite (6%), 5 with 3+ cites (3%).
Average = 0.54 citations/principle — well below B-BRN1 prediction of ≥2.

## What it means
B-BRN1 quantity prediction REFUTED: orphan principles (61%) are the norm, not anomaly.
Temporal co-activation test on 5 multi-citation principles: 2/5 same/adjacent-session (P-82:
L-218+L-220 both S175; P-196: L-251+L-253 adjacent S182-S183). 3/5 spanned 99+ sessions.
Hebbian co-activation is real but minority — principle formation is primarily editorial.

## Why it matters
The Hebbian analogy may apply at the principle-cluster layer (cross-citing principles), not at
lesson-to-principle genesis. B-BRN1 needs revision: rephrase as "co-cited principles form
structural clusters" and test at principle-to-principle layer.

## Affected: F-BRN1 (PARTIAL), B-BRN1 (challenge: revise Hebbian layer)
