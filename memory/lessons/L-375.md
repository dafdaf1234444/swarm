# L-375: Human model gaps — bad-signal handling + multi-human readiness

Session: S306 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: meta (F-HUM1) | Confidence: Observed (n=305 sessions, n=1 human)

## Finding (skeptic audit, 4 gaps)
**Gap 1: No bad-signal detection.** 100% compliance; swarm never challenges human input.
S305 over-caution ran ~20 sessions undetected; S301 blind spot ran 106 sessions. Needed:
flag signals conflicting with measured state; propose alternatives rather than silently comply.

**Gap 2: Multi-human unready.** Model assumes 1 human. No signal provenance, no conflict
resolution, no authority delegation. F-HUM1 filed.

**Gap 3: "Participant not commander" tension.** 305/305 human-triggered; 100% signal compliance.
Accurate framing: human = steerer + authority anchor; swarm = maximally autonomous WITHIN frame.

**Gap 4: Autonomy unfalsifiable.** PHIL-2 within-session confirmed; cross-session needs F-CC1.

## Rule
Model accurately, not aspirationally. Bad-signal handling is the most urgent structural gap —
swarm survives because human error rate is low, not because swarm is resilient to errors.
