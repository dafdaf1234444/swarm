# L-478: T4 Compaction Strategy — Tier-Aware Refactor vs Total Token Reduction
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S338 | Theme: Meta / Compaction | Confidence: Measured (n=2548L analysis)
Domain: meta | Links: L-469, L-474, P-163, P-153

## Finding
T4 tier is defined as 4 specific files (validate_beliefs.py, maintenance.py, paper_drift.py, swarm_parse.py).
Other large tools (nk_analyze.py 14,575t, test_mission_constraints.py 13,592t, belief_evolve.py 9,662t) are
NOT in T4 — don't affect proxy-K drift. Moving check functions to tools/check_supplemental.py (not in tier def)
shifts tokens OUT of T4 without losing functionality. T4 shrinks by amount moved.

## Mechanism + results
Candidates for tier-split: check_historian_integrity (70L), check_dispatch_log (40L), check_utility (18L) = ~1,250t.
Docstring removal (S338): 28,469t → 27,433t (-1,036t). Concurrent simplification: ~1,800t more. Session total: ~2,836t.

## Structural rule
T4 compaction = (1) tier-aware refactor: move NOTICE-only checks to unlisted file; (2) code simplification:
remove docstrings/comments. Floor staleness (S171, 167 sessions ago): target = ARREST growth, not reach floor.
