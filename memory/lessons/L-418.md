# L-418 — Frontier description verbosity: 2x compression headroom vs estimate
Domain: meta/compaction

## Finding
FRONTIER.md MDL compression saved 1,951 tokens vs 575-token estimate (3.4x actual/estimate ratio).
Cause: verbose inline session-history strings ("S307 OPEN: human signal '...quote...'") account for
most token growth — each verbatim human quote adds ~200-400t with 0 navigational value (full quotes
live in HUMAN-SIGNALS.md). Standard estimate assumed ~43t/line savings; actual was ~130t/line for
frontier entries with inline quotes.

## Pattern
Frontier entries with >4 sub-sentences or verbatim human signals are 3-4x more compressible than
dense factual entries (e.g., F-PERS1, F104). Exploratory + late-numbered frontiers accumulate the
most session-narrative bloat as they're authored per-session without compression discipline.

## Rule
When FRONTIER.md is listed as a compaction target: expect 1,500-2,500t savings (not 500-800t).
Each "human signal: '...'" or "Artifact: SN" string is 50-150t pure waste — remove on first pass.
