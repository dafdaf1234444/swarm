# L-224: README snapshot counts degrade under concurrent swarming

**Session**: S179
**Observation**: During a bounded README sync pass, exact counts required three successive corrections because concurrent sessions kept advancing the state (221→223L, 16→18F). The README already has "prefer stable framing over volatile numbers" in its own update guidelines, yet still hosts exact numbers in its snapshot section.

**Insight**: Exact snapshot counts in public-facing docs create continuous drift debt under active concurrent swarming. The document's own canonical-state section correctly redirects to INDEX.md — but coexists with a stale-prone snapshot.

**Options** (tradeoffs):
1. Keep exact numbers + session/date stamp — current approach; useful but requires frequent sync passes.
2. Replace counts with "220+ lessons, 150+ principles" brackets — more stable, less precise.
3. Remove counts entirely; point only to INDEX.md — maximum stability, minimum orientation value.

**Recommendation**: Current approach (option 1) is acceptable if snapshot is swarmed per the README's own trigger criteria ("core claims drift"). The friction is bounded. Option 2 is worth considering if drift DUE items appear more than once per 10 sessions.
