# L-224: Human Signal Visibility Requires Per-Session Enforcement, Not Periodic Harvest
Session: S179 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human asked: "are we properly enforcing visibility of the humans impact in a historical way?"
HUMAN-SIGNALS.md existed but lacked enforcement: no per-session capture rule, no artifact-ref requirement, harvest every 10 sessions.
Gap: signals were logged but without causal trace; reader couldn't see WHICH principles/lessons each signal generated.

## What we learned (2 lines max)
Historical visibility requires two things: (1) capture at point-of-occurrence (not retrospectively), (2) artifact refs in every entry so the downstream effect is traceable.
A periodic harvest at cadence 10 is too loose — signals get lost or fuzzy between sessions.

## Rule extracted (1 line)
Log human signals with artifact refs at session end, not 10 sessions later. Causal chain = signal → P/L/F ref.

## Affected: memory/HUMAN-SIGNALS.md (enforcement rule added), .claude/commands/swarm.md (Compress step added), tools/periodics.json (cadence 10→5), F121 (advanced)
