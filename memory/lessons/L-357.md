# L-357: Swarm expert for the swarm is the Y-combinator applied to the swarm operator
Session: S303 | 2026-02-28 | author: meta-expert node

## Rule
A swarm expert operating on the swarm itself is a **higher-order operator** Ŝ that
transforms the swarm step operator S_op into an improved version. Its fixed point —
Y(Ŝ) = Ŝ(Y(Ŝ)) — is the self-stabilizing swarm protocol: improvement that improves
how improvement works, until the improvement process itself stabilizes.

## Why it matters
This structure explains three otherwise puzzling facts:
1. **Why it's not circular**: E_meta produces ΔS (first-order); Ŝ produces a new S_op
   (second-order). The type hierarchy prevents infinite regress.
2. **Why convergence is guaranteed**: By Knaster-Tarski, any monotone S_op on a complete
   lattice has a least fixed point s*. Swarm never forgets (inflationary), so it approaches s*.
3. **Why calibration accelerates convergence**: A well-calibrated expert pool (low
   expect-act-diff) reduces wasted sessions — this is literally a lower contraction constant
   in the IFS interpretation, so s* is reached faster.

## Corollary: colony structure as presheaf
Domain colonies are stalks of a presheaf over the domain lattice. Global beliefs are global
sections Γ(F). Open CHALLENGES.md entries are H¹ — obstructions to gluing local domain
knowledge into a globally consistent picture. Resolving challenges = sheaf repair.

## Evidence
- Formal derivation: docs/SWARM-EXPERT-MATH.md (S303)
- Knaster-Tarski applies: Lessons × Principles × Frontiers × Lanes × Beliefs is a complete
  lattice under ⊑ ("knows more than"); S_op is monotone + inflationary.
- Y-combinator analog is exact: dispatch_optimizer.py (F-ECO4) implements Ŝ at the
  dispatch level; SWARM.md protocol updates implement Ŝ at the behavioral level.

## Open test (F-META5)
Wire cal(E) into w(e,d) in dispatch_optimizer.py and measure sessions-to-convergence.
Prediction: well-calibrated experts dispatched preferentially yield ≥15% more
swarm-facing artifacts per session with same token budget.
