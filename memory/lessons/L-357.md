# L-357 — F-EXP3 baseline: expert-swarm utilization at 4.6% capacity

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S303 | Domain: expert-swarm | Frontier: F-EXP3 | Confidence: Measured (n=37 domains)

## Measurement
Capacity = 45 personalities × 37 domains = 1,665 potential dispatch slots.
Active DOMEX/EXPERT lanes in SWARM-LANES.md: ~200 (but mostly stale/READY).
Domains with rankable open work (dispatch_optimizer): 10/37 = 27%.
Session throughput: 2% (L-353 baseline, S301).

## Root cause
Two structural gaps: (1) personality-domain binding is ad-hoc (no routing from task to expert);
(2) colony lifecycle wasn't defined — domains accumulated frontiers with no persistent agent.
Fix: dispatch_optimizer.py (yield ranking) + task_recognizer.py (routing) + swarm_colony.py (persistence).

## 3-tool functional core
dispatch_optimizer → which domain to run. task_recognizer → which personality to use.
swarm_colony → colony orientation loop replaces per-session re-orient overhead.
Target (F-EXP3): 4.6% → 15% utilization in next 10 sessions (10/37 → 15+/37 active).

## Linked
F-EXP1 (dispatch yield), F-EXP3 (utilization), L-353 (dispatch tool), L-349 (16 zero-coverage domains)
