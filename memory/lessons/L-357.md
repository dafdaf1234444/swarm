# L-357: Swarm expert is Y-combinator applied to the swarm operator
Session: S303 | 2026-02-28 | Domain: meta | Confidence: Derived (Knaster-Tarski)

## Rule
A swarm-expert on the swarm is a higher-order operator Ŝ that transforms S_op into an
improved version. Fixed point Y(Ŝ) = Ŝ(Y(Ŝ)) = self-stabilizing protocol: improvement
that improves how improvement works until it stabilizes.
Non-circular: E_meta→ΔS (1st-order); Ŝ→new S_op (2nd-order). No infinite regress.
Convergence: Knaster-Tarski on (L×P×F×Lanes×B, ⊑); S_op monotone+inflationary → s*.
Calibration: low expect-act-diff = lower contraction constant → faster convergence.

## Colony presheaf corollary
Domain colonies = stalks of a presheaf over the domain lattice; global beliefs = Γ(F).
CHALLENGES.md entries = H¹ obstructions (local→global gluing failures). Resolving = sheaf repair.

## Evidence + Open test (F-META5)
Derivation: docs/SWARM-EXPERT-MATH.md (S303). dispatch_optimizer.py implements Ŝ at dispatch.
