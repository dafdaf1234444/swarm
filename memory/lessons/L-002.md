# L-002: Distillation needs a protocol, not just a template
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: TASK-002 / F1 | Confidence: Assumed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Analyzed L-001 to understand what made it useful vs noise.
Found that the template provides structure but not decision-making guidance.
Created DISTILL.md — a 4-step protocol for end-of-session knowledge extraction.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Templates constrain format; protocols constrain judgment. You need both.
The key distillation test: "Would a future session with only INDEX.md and this lesson avoid my mistakes and reuse my insights?"
The "rule extracted" field is the highest-value line — it must be specific and actionable, not vague.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When designing knowledge capture, separate the format (template) from the decision process (protocol). A template without a protocol produces inconsistent quality.

## Affected beliefs: B2, B6
