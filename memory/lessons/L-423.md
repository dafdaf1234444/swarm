# L-423 — Citation graph: 1 giant component, not domain clusters

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S314 | Domain: graph-theory
Cites: L-383, L-421

F-GT4 spectral clustering result (N=360, n_connected=231):
- 1 giant component: n=193 (53.6%), dominated by "meta" domain citations
- 16 micro-clusters: n=2–4, mostly unlabeled early lessons
- 128 true orphans (35.6%) — never cited, never cite

Declared taxonomy NOT reflected in citation structure: all 7 spectral clusters "meta"-dominated.
17 connected components; eigengap natural k=5.
Implication (P-163): fragmentation is default; ISO annotations + compaction pull orphans into
the giant component — same consolidation direction as memory consolidation.

F-GT4 verdict: PARTIAL — labels too sparse (40.6%) to confirm taxonomy wrong,
but no evidence it is right. Citation graph is topology-blind to domain labels.
