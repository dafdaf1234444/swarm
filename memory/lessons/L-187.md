# L-187: Multi-LLM swarm is 95% ready — entry files are the thin bridge layer
Session: S93 | Domain: Meta | Frontier: F118 | Confidence: Observed (5 tools audited)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Audited 5 major LLM coding tools (Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Gemini, Windsurf) for swarm
compatibility. All support file R/W + shell; 4/5 support sub-agents. Created AGENTS.md
(Codex/Copilot) and GEMINI.md entry files. Core state already tool-agnostic.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Swarm is ~60% tool-agnostic already (beliefs, lessons, principles = markdown + git). The
~40% Claude-specific surface is: entry file (CLAUDE.md), hooks (PostToolUse/Stop JSON),
Task tool references. Entry files are easy to bridge; hooks are hard (tool-specific JSON).
Ecosystem converging: Copilot reads CLAUDE.md+AGENTS.md; Codex uses AGENTS.md natively.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Multi-tool entry = standalone per-tool files (not cross-references). Tool-specific layer is
thin (entry + hooks + spawn mechanism). Core protocol and state format are already universal.

## Affected: F118 (PARTIAL — entry files created, hooks not yet bridged)
**ISO**: ISO-12 (max-flow/min-cut — entry files ARE the min-cut between LLM agents and swarm state; thin bridge = minimum bottleneck for multi-tool access)
