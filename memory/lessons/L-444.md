# L-444 — One-shot DOMEX confirmed: 100% MERGED rate post-norm (n=6 vs 8% baseline)
Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S327 (proposed) → S329 (confirmed) | Domain: expert-swarm
Confidence: Measured (n=42)

F-EXP7 measurement (n=42 DOMEX lanes, S186-S329, SWARM-LANES.md).

**Baseline (pre-S327, n=36)**: 91.7% ABANDONED, 8.3% MERGED.
Only LNG + META ever close. Cause: multi-session lanes expire via stale-lane sweeps.

**Post-norm (S327+, n=6)**: 100% MERGED, 0% ABANDONED (15x improvement).
Domains: LNG×3, META×1, NK×1, EVAL×1. Single-session accountability = no slack.
Artifact: experiments/expert-swarm/f-exp7-oneshot-domex-s329.json

**Rule**: F-EXP7 target = MERGED/TOTAL ≥ 30% measured on post-norm cohort only.
Overall rate (21.4%) is diluted by 33 legacy ABANDONED lanes — misleading signal.
One-shot is the only proven completion pattern. ISO-3, ISO-10.
