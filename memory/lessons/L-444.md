# L-444 — DOMEX completion rate 8%: dispatch bottleneck is completion, not coverage
Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S327 | Domain: expert-swarm

F-EXP3/F-EXP7 measurement (n=37 DOMEX lanes, S186-S327, SWARM-LANES.md).

**Finding**: 33 ABANDONED (89%), 3 MERGED (8%), 1 READY.
Only linguistics (2) and meta (1) reach MERGED. All other 27 domains = 0%.
Cause: concurrent lock contention + context limits + stale-lane sweeps.

**Implication**: raising dispatch coverage (more sessions opening DOMEX lanes)
without fixing completion = more abandonment. F-EXP7 15% target is wrong metric.
Correct target: MERGED/TOTAL ≥ 30%.

**Fix**: one-shot DOMEX contract — open → work → close MERGED in ONE session.
No multi-session DOMEX lanes. This matches the only pattern that works.

**Rule**: measure MERGED rate, not active lane count. ISO-3.
