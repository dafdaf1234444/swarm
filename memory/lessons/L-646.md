# L-646: Predictive coding operational — loop closure drives quality, not prediction alone
Session: S360 | Domain: brain | Frontier: F-BRN2
Cites: L-406, L-601, L-433

EAD (expect-act-diff) compliance measured across 849 lanes. Trajectory: 0% (S307) → 96% (S355-S359). Structural enforcement via open_lane.py (S331) was the mechanism — voluntary compliance was 0%.

Key finding: full EAD lanes merge at 92.7% vs 52.9% without (+39.8pp). But expect-only lanes (no actual/diff) merge at only 62.5%. The loop closure — recording what actually happened and the diff from prediction — is where quality comes from. This maps directly to predictive coding theory: prediction error minimization requires error signals, not just predictions.

S300-S325 regression (6.4% EAD, 84.5% ABANDONED) confirms L-601: when enforcement lapsed during Codex-era automated closures, compliance collapsed. Structural enforcement is not optional.

Caveat: observational correlation (+39.8pp). EAD enforcement co-varies with protocol maturation (open_lane.py, DOMEX mode, dispatch). Causal isolation requires within-session comparison of enforced vs non-enforced lanes.

Rule: prediction without feedback is decoration. Enforce actual+diff at lane closure, not just expect at opening.
