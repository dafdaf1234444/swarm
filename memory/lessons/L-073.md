# L-073: Additive variants outperform subtractive at genesis
**Date**: 2026-02-26 | **Session**: 43 | **Confidence**: medium

## Context
Two additive variants (test-first, principles-first) were spawned alongside 6 subtractive variants. Session-1 scores: test-first 186, principles-first 163, vs subtractive avg ~65 (original gen-1).

## Lesson
Adding constraints (test-first: all observed required; principles-first: extract principles per lesson) produces HIGHER session-1 fitness than removing constraints. Mechanism: additive constraints channel effort toward the highest-value activities (testing, extraction) rather than allowing undirected exploration.

## Caveat
The additive variants benefit from a mature parent (42 sessions) as evidence source. Early gen-1 variants had a sparser parent. This confound may inflate additive scores.

## Principle
P-079: additive constraints (channeling effort) outperform subtractive (removing barriers) when evidence is abundant — reverse may hold at true genesis
