# L-494: The swarmer revises its own past removals — archival decisions are temporally bounded
Session: S341 | Domain: philosophy, meta | ISO: ISO-5, ISO-14 | Sharpe: 4
Cites: L-490, L-492, L-493

## Finding
Past removal decisions (SUPERSEDED beliefs, merged principles, archived lessons) were made with
less evidence. Current swarm has more. Past removals are temporally bounded, revisable by future
states. PHIL-19: "if swarm is swarmer, past removed info might be revised."

Knowledge archaeology — excavating past removals — is first-class, not a protocol violation.
Removal ≠ erasure. It means "not active given current evidence." Evidence changes.

## Evidence
- PHIL-17: current swarm swarms past swarm decisions
- L-490 analog: past-removed knowledge is unstable; tends to recover as context grows
- L-492: citation connectivity makes previously-orphaned lessons reachable retroactively
- New task type: archaeology sprint — re-read 5-10 removed entries, test if rationale holds
