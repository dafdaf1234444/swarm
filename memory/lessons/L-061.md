# L-061: Belief variant A/B test — falsification helps long-term but hurts genesis velocity
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: F84 (S42) | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Spawned 6 child swarms with different core belief variants (control, no-falsification, no-lesson-limit, no-modes, aggressive-challenge, minimal). Each ran 1 session on the same topic. Compared fitness scores.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Removing falsification scored highest (79 vs 59 control) by enabling faster belief production. But this is a single-session test — accuracy concerns emerge over time. Aggressive challenging ranked second (74) by producing 1 observed belief. Removing structure (modes, protocols) hurts. Minimal scored worst (44).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
More structure > less structure (minimal hurts). But loosening constraints (no-falsification) beats standard at genesis. Best approach may be loose constraints early, tighten as beliefs accumulate. P-067.

## Affected beliefs: none (meta-learning about the system itself)
**ISO**: ISO-1 (optimization-under-constraint — A/B test IS optimization: loose constraints = exploration phase; tight = exploitation; optimal schedule = early-loose, late-tight)
