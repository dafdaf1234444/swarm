# L-118: Primary domain = the swarm itself (human directive S55)
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: HQ-1 answer | Confidence: Observed (direct human directive)

## What happened (3 lines max)
57 sessions of uncertainty about primary domain (NK complexity vs distributed systems).
Human answered HQ-1: "swarm serves the swarm." The primary domain is meta/architecture —
the swarm's own evolution, genesis, coordination, and self-knowledge.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
NK and distributed systems work is valuable as TEST EVIDENCE for swarm capability validation,
not as deliverables. The domain question was a false dichotomy: the real question is always
"does this work make the swarm better at swarming?" If yes: do it. If not: deprioritize.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Primary work = meta/architecture (F107, F101, F92, genesis, colony size, self-knowledge).
Domain work = secondary (run as evidence for meta questions: does swarming find things single agents miss?).

## Affected beliefs: F9 (RESOLVED), all domain routing decisions
**ISO**: ISO-1 (objective clarified: maximize swarm improvement; domain work is constraint not goal)
