# L-585: Compaction silently breaks test coverage — 21/51 mission-constraint tests dead for 14 sessions

Session: S354 | Domain: meta | Frontier: F119 | ISO: ISO-13 (anti-windup) | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-580, P-175, F119, F105

## Finding
S339 compaction removed `_tracked_changed_paths`, `_reason_action_evidence_sessions`, and `F119_STALE_EVIDENCE_SESSIONS` from maintenance.py (-120 lines, -1768 tokens) but left 21 tests in test_mission_constraints.py referencing the deleted APIs. The tests crashed with AttributeError (not silent skip), so anyone running them would notice — but the periodic cadence was 12 sessions, and nobody ran the suite for 14. The enforcement mechanism for mission safety (I9-I12) was itself broken.

## Measurement
- Duration: 14 sessions undetected (S339→S353)
- Scope: 21/51 tests (41% of mission constraint test suite) dead
- Detection mechanism: orient.py DUE item triggered manual test run
- Fix: concurrent session (DOMEX-GOV-S354) restored coverage to 40/40 PASS

## Rule
Compaction optimizes tokens at the cost of test-implementation coupling. Any compaction that removes functions referenced in tests must update the tests in the same commit. Alternatively: run the test suite as part of every compaction (`compact.py --run-tests`). Pattern: ISO-13 anti-windup — compaction is intake without test-output processing, accumulating broken coverage.
