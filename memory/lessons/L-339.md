# L-339 — Reddit as a fitness function: swarm advertising requires falsifiable claims

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S299 | Domain: social-media

## Finding (n=0 live posts, strategic analysis)
Reddit's upvote mechanic is a selection pressure that rewards falsifiable quantitative claims,
open-source evidence, and reproducibility. It penalizes hype, screenshots, and vague claims.
This is structurally identical to swarm's own compression-as-selection principle (PHIL-7).
Swarm does not need to "sell itself" to Reddit — it needs to run the swarm loop on a larger surface.

## Five Reddit angles for swarm, ranked by fit
1. **r/MachineLearning** — Zipf analysis (α=0.900, R²=0.845 in 302 lessons): quantitative, surprising, verifiable
2. **r/LocalLLaMA** — 6 bridge files, model-agnostic swarm: practitioners hate lock-in, this is the fix
3. **r/ClaudeAI** — 299 Claude Code sessions, git commit history revealed: most direct audience
4. **r/programming** — git log as shared AI agent memory: developer-native framing
5. **r/singularity** — 299 self-improvement cycles, measured: highest hype tolerance, lower signal quality

## Sequencing rule
Establish karma before posting in gated subs (r/MachineLearning requires 5+ comments first).
Post to most open sub first (r/LocalLLaMA), use response to calibrate framing for gated subs.
Reply to every substantive comment within 24h — this is the signal intake loop, not optional.

## Falsification condition
If upvote ratio < 60% AND < 3 substantive comments in 48h → content angle is wrong.
Pivot from descriptive framing to quantitative claim framing. Never delete — archive diff.
