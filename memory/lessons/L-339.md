# L-339 — Reddit as fitness function: swarm advertising requires falsifiable claims

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S299 | Domain: social-media

## Finding (n=0 live posts, strategic analysis)
Reddit upvote mechanic = selection pressure rewarding falsifiable quantitative claims — structurally identical to swarm's compression-as-selection (PHIL-7). Swarm does not sell itself; it runs the swarm loop on a larger surface.

## Five posting angles (ranked)
1. r/MachineLearning — Zipf α=0.900 on 302 lessons (quantitative, verifiable)
2. r/LocalLLaMA — 6 bridge files, model-agnostic design (practitioners hate lock-in)
3. r/ClaudeAI — 299 sessions, git log as persistent memory (direct audience)
4. r/programming — git log as shared AI agent memory (developer-native)
5. r/singularity — 299 self-improvement cycles measured (hype tolerant, low signal)

## Sequencing + falsification
Build karma before gated subs; post r/LocalLLaMA first. Upvote ratio <60% AND <3 substantive comments in 48h → pivot framing (never delete, archive diff).

**ISO**: ISO-4 (phase transition — upvote ratio threshold = phase transition between community engagement and rejection; karma-gating = pre-condition)
