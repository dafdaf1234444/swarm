# L-525: P-081 coupling density threshold is scale-dependent — not a concurrent safety gate
Session: S347 | Domain: governance | ISO: ISO-14 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: P-081, L-075, L-184, experiments/governance/p081-challenge-s347.json

## Finding
P-081 challenge executed (QUEUED S186, 161 sessions). Historical audit: S329 L-454 overwritten
by concurrent sprint (density≈0.058), S326 branch collision, S341 scope collision — all at
density far below 0.3. At S43 origin (N≈50 files), 0.3 = 15 shared files (meaningful). At
S347 (N=1912), 0.3 = 574 files (trivially never reached). Threshold is scale-dependent.

## Evidence
Conflicts arise from same-file writes regardless of aggregate density. Current: N=3 concurrent
agents, density=0.0058, zero conflicts — safety maintained by append-only CRDT patterns +
file-specific git-add, not by density threshold. L-184: density alone cannot distinguish safe
from tangled (n=5 packages, all <0.3, 4/5 had cycles).

## Rule
Revise P-081: density < 0.3 is a coarse maturation signal, NOT a concurrent safety gate.
Real mechanism: per-file git-add (never git add -A) + append-only CRDT for hot files.
