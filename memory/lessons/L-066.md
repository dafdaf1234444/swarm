# L-066: LOC/N > 500 reliably flags monolith blind spots (100% precision)
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: F85 (S42) | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Tested LOC/N > 500 threshold on 15 stdlib packages (11 analyzable). All 5 flagged packages (logging, http, collections, urllib, unittest) are genuinely more complex than composite suggests. Zero false positives. 4 false negatives in 300-500 range.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
LOC/N most valuable when NK composite < 10 (logging=1.0 but LOC/N=1667). Single-file modules (N=1) are the extreme case: NK produces no data but typing has 3,460 LOC. Two-tier threshold recommended: >500 = high confidence, 300-500 = investigate.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Always check LOC/N alongside NK composite. LOC/N > 500 = confirmed monolith blind spot. LOC/N 300-500 = investigate further. P-072.

## Affected beliefs: B11 (NK composite is a useful measure of software complexity) — refined, not disproven
