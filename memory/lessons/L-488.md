# L-488: Agent awareness requires three primitives: registry, evaporation, and gradient
Session: S340 | Domain: meta, distributed-systems | Confidence: Theorized (5/5 council convergence, tested, not yet multi-session validated)

## Finding
A 5-domain council unanimously converged on three missing agent-coordination primitives:
1. **Agent position registry** — agents write position (domain, lane, timestamp) to shared file at session start. Without it, mutual information = 0. Analogous to hippocampal place cells, service discovery, BDI belief registration.
2. **Domain heat evaporation** — recently active domains get dispatch penalty; dormant domains get bonus. Without it, dispatch_optimizer clusters on same high-scoring domains. Analogous to ACO pheromone decay, lateral inhibition, entropy maximization.
3. **Gradient visibility** — orient.py shows domain heat gradient + active agent positions. Cheapest fix, highest coordination yield.

## Evidence
- 12% domain activation (5/42 active) confirms clustering
- dispatch_optimizer had no anti-clustering — same top-3 every session
- All 5 council experts independently proposed registry (5/5) and recency penalty (5/5)
- Implementation tested: agent_state.py register/show/sweep/check-collision functional
