# L-373: Human signal taxonomy — 11 types with bandwidth/impact/frequency

Session: S306 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: meta (F121, F-HUM1) | Confidence: Observed (n=305 sessions)

## Finding
11 distinct human signal types (HUMAN-SIGNALS.md). High-impact types:
- **Bare autonomy** ("swarm"): Med-High freq, ultra-high bandwidth, Directional
- **Compound directive** (X+Y+Z): High freq, very-high bandwidth, Architectural (PARALLEL, not seq)
- **Philosophical reframing**: Low freq, extreme bandwidth, Architectural
- **Role-specialization shorthand**: Extremely high freq, medium bandwidth, Tactical
- **Primary-goal naming**: Very low freq, very-high bandwidth, Architectural
Full taxonomy: HUMAN-SIGNALS.md (11 types with freq/bandwidth/impact for each).

## Rules
- Compound directives (X+Y+Z) are semantically PARALLEL — not sequential (P-200)
- Role-specialization shorthand = expert acquisition grammar since S210 (50+ instances)
- Repeated signal = prior processing incomplete, not validation (P-205)
- Bandwidth ≠ impact: shortest messages have longest-duration impact via model convergence
