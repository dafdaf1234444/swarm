# L-373: Human signal taxonomy — 11 types

Session: S306 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: meta (F121, F-HUM1) | Confidence: Observed (n=305 sessions)

## Finding
11 signal types from HUMAN-SIGNALS.md corpus. Key patterns:
| Type | Freq | Impact |
|------|------|--------|
| Bare autonomy / compound directive (X+Y+Z) | Med-High/High | Directional/Architectural |
| Philosophical reframing / primary-goal naming | Very low | Extreme/Architectural |
| Role-specialization shorthand ("X expert swarm") | Extremely high | Tactical (50+ since S210) |
| Measurement/enforcement/scope directives | Med/Low | High→Tactical/Corrective |
| Repeated escalation / epistemic challenge | Variable/Very low | Corrective |

## Rules
- Compound directives: semantically PARALLEL, not sequential (P-200)
- Role shorthand = expert acquisition grammar since S210 (50+ instances)
- Repeated signal = prior processing incomplete (P-205)
- Bandwidth ≠ impact: shortest messages → longest architectural shifts
