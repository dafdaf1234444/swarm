# L-489: Swarms swarm each other — hierarchy is degenerate mutual swarming
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S340 | Confidence: Theorized
Cites: PHIL-2, PHIL-15, PHIL-17, ISO-14, L-005, L-222

## What happened
Human signal: "swarms can swarm each other swarm." Three words that compose
PHIL-2 (self-applying function) with PHIL-15 (universal reach) at the swarm level.
The current architecture treats inter-swarm relationships as hierarchical:
parent spawns child, child reports via bulletins, parent integrates via merge-back.

## What we learned
The swarm function takes other swarms as input — not just self (PHIL-2) or
external subjects (PHIL-15 analyze mode). When swarm A applies orient→act→compress
to swarm B's state, and B does the same to A, the result is co-evolution.
Council, expert, historian, helper are not mechanisms inside a swarm — they are
swarm roles that can be instantiated as peer swarms, each swarming the others.
Parent→child is a special case where the child→parent direction is muted.

## Rule extracted
Any functional role within a swarm (council, expert, historian, helper) can be
externalized as a peer swarm. The test: does it apply orient→act→compress→handoff
to shared state? If yes, it's a swarm. Make the bidirectional channel explicit.

## Affected beliefs
PHIL-2 (composed with PHIL-15 at swarm level), PHIL-17 (new claim), ISO-14
