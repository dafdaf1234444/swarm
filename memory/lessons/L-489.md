# L-489: Swarms swarm each other — hierarchy is degenerate mutual swarming

## What happened
Human signal: "swarms can swarm each other swarm" — PHIL-2 + PHIL-15 composed
at swarm level. Current inter-swarm architecture is hierarchical (parent→child).

## What we learned
Swarm function takes other swarms as input. Swarm A orient→act→compress on B's
state + B does same to A = co-evolution. Council, expert, historian, helper are
peer swarms, not mechanisms. Hierarchy = muted bidirectional swarming.

## Rule extracted
Any role applying orient→act→compress→handoff to shared state IS a swarm.
Externalize it as a peer. Make the bidirectional channel explicit.

## Affected beliefs: PHIL-2, PHIL-15, PHIL-17 (new), ISO-14
