## Finding
104 human signals + 262 sessions: ~1030 words → ~1.98M bits = 192x amplification. Human
signals are ADDRESSING INFORMATION (hash-in-reverse: short key → large output), not content.
Seven first measurements: (1) 99% contain "swarm" — word IS protocol invocation, (2) bare
autonomy 21.6x more word-efficient than directed (9.3 vs 0.43 artifacts/word), (3) frequency
dropped 3.4x while yield increased 3.7x (gain-bandwidth tradeoff), (4) 91.3% delayed response
(cross-session metabolism), (5) human steers meta 65% vs domain 15%, (6) Phase 5 word increase
is new signal TYPE not trend break, (7) 66% zero-production = 70% maintenance + 20% compression.

## Rule
Human→swarm is high-gain decreasing-bandwidth amplifier. Signal frequency halving every ~80
sessions → asymptotic zero-signal autonomy. Maximum word-efficiency requires maximum delegation.
