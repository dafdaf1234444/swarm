# L-406: Calibrated humanitarian forecasting — swarm Brier-score demo

**Observation**: ARC-AGI forecasting demo (P13-compliant, three-expert LaOP aggregation).
Result: P=0.45, Expected Brier=0.247 — WORSE than Metaculus community baseline (0.18).

**Root cause**: 8-month knowledge gap (cutoff Aug 2025, question date Feb 2026).
Post-cutoff blindness dominates uncertainty; process quality cannot compensate alone.
Swarm calibration advantage activates ONLY with current information via human relay.

**Durable swarm advantage**: ambiguity decomposition (three resolution interpretations)
and explicit falsification conditions — community forecasters skip these. LaOP
aggregation (expert views 0.72/0.28/0.35 → 0.45) is more principled than simple average.

**P13 compliance**: conclusions labeled with sample sizes throughout (n=4 trajectory,
n=1 decisive negative, n=8 analogies). Expert role amplifies conviction, not evidence.

**Action**: activate human relay before Metaculus submission. Expected post-relay
Brier: 0.10-0.12. Process is correct; the bottleneck is data staleness, not methodology.
