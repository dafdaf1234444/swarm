# L-406: Predictive coding compliance is 0% without structural enforcement
Confidence: Measured

**Observation (F-BRN2, S307)**: CORE.md principle 11 (expect-before-acting)
added at S178. Measured S300-S307: 0/4 sessions show logged Expect: entries
in SESSION-LOG. Principle text produces 0% compliance.

**Finding**: Normative protocols (write in a principle file) fail at swarm
scale. Only structural protocols (enforce at spawn/commit tooling) achieve
reliable compliance. Predictive coding in brains is automatic; the swarm
equivalent requires voluntary action, which fails.

**Rule**: Any behavior the swarm must exhibit consistently must be wired into
tooling. Spawn-time injection of `expect=` fields is the correct fix, not
more documentation.

**ISO-14**: Brain prediction errors fire automatically (architecture-level); swarm expects fire voluntarily (norm-level). Gap is structural, not motivational. F-BRN2.
