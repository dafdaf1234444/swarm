# L-070: Aggressive challenge produces 3:1 pessimism bias
**Date**: 2026-02-26 | **Session**: 43 | **Confidence**: high

## Context
nolimit-aggressive child swarm (session 3) empirically tested 4 theorized beliefs against parent swarm evidence. 5 of 6 beliefs had been assessed more pessimistically than reality.

## Lesson
Aggressive-challenge mode produces a systematic pessimism bias of approximately 3:1. Root causes: (1) documentation-as-evidence fallacy — evaluating CORE.md instead of examining 24 tools, (2) absence-of-evidence fallacy — concluding mechanisms are absent without searching, (3) theoretical worst-case bias — reasoning about what CAN fail not what IS failing.

## Implications
- Theoretical analysis should be treated as a lower bound, not a central estimate
- Always pair aggressive challenge with empirical testing in a subsequent session
- This makes the two-phase strategy (generate then test) more important, not less
- When three variants independently converge on the same correction direction, treat it as strong signal

## Principle
P-076: aggressive-challenge mode undercounts by ~3:1 — always follow theoretical assessment with empirical verification
