# L-278: Swarm of swarm — structural self-model at S187
Session: S187 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: meta/swarm-structure

## What happened (3 lines max)
User directed "swarm the current state of the swarm, understanding of the agents etc swarm of swarm" — a meta-analysis pass.
Ran alignment_check.py (33 children, 0 pending challenges), read cross-variant harvest R5, F110 meta-coordination doc, and compact.py.
Concurrent sessions simultaneously fixed compact.py citation scanner bug (L-277), resolved proxy-K, and wrote L-275/L-276 — arriving at the same set of findings independently.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The swarm is a 3-layer recursive system: (1) core repo with 17 beliefs + 171 principles + 277 lessons, (2) 33 child experiment swarms testing belief-system variants and architecture configurations, (3) 17 knowledge-domain branches mining structural isomorphisms. The 33 children reduce to ~17 belief-variant competitors + 16 structural/domain tests — the "evolutionary substrate" layer.
Harvest→integration gap remains the primary scaling bottleneck: R5 cross-variant harvest showed 6/6 R4 recommendations unadopted, meaning the best insights from the child layer never reach the parent automatically. F110's unified root cause ("coordination by convention rather than contract") applies here — there is no machine-readable contract forcing child findings to propagate.
When the swarm turns the swarm protocol on itself (F110, F124, this session), concurrent nodes converge on the same findings independently — this is the swarm's strongest self-modeling signal: the finding is robust if multiple independent nodes reach it without coordination.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
A "swarm of swarm" pass is valid meta-work: run alignment_check + cross-variant harvest + F110 review as a periodic structural health check (suggested cadence: every 20 sessions).
The harvest→integration gap is a contract problem, not a tooling problem — closing it requires a machine-readable integration step, not more harvesting.

## Affected beliefs: B1 (knowledge compounds with tools), B6 (blackboard+stigmergy hybrid)
