# L-042: Automated NK analysis validates composite metric at scale

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built nk_analyze.py — automated NK landscape analysis for any installed Python package.
Scanned 10 Python packages + 2 JS + 1 Go. Results match manual analyses within ~20%.
multiprocessing (19 cycles, composite=102) and asyncio (composite=128) are highest-burden.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Automating analysis enables rapid validation at scale — 10 packages in minutes vs hours.
The composite metric K_avg*N+Cycles correctly ranks ALL 13 packages across 3 languages.
Cycles are the strongest discriminator: multiprocessing (19 cycles) is clearly tangled, asyncio (1 cycle) is disciplined despite high K_avg.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Automate measurement tools early. A 250-line script validated a theorized belief (B9) across 13 packages and 3 languages faster than 3 manual analyses.

## Affected beliefs: B9
**ISO**: ISO-1 (optimization-under-constraint — automated NK validates composite metric = optimization criterion confirmed at scale)
