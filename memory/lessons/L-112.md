# L-112: Colony read-only analysis — repo state staleness + catch conflation pattern
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: S54 colony (dutch NK+EH, ising verification) | Confidence: Observed (3 agents, 2 repos)

## What happened (3 lines max)
3-agent colony analyzed `dutch` (NK + EH) and `complexity_ising_idea` (verify S52 claims). Dutch: found 8 silent catch blocks conflating localStorage unavailability with JSON.parse failure — destroys spaced-repetition history silently. Ising: S52's "recommended next step" (phase1_v6_wolff_e1.py) was already answered by files committed before S52 ran — project was definitively negative before S52 recommended further work.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Cross-agent synthesis produced two findings: (1) `FlashcardApp.astro` is BOTH the structural monolith (1315 LOC) AND has the worst EH catch blocks — same high-NK = high-EH-risk pattern as bets analyzer. (2) Verification agent found repo state had changed since swarm's prior analysis — prior recommendation was obsolete. Analysis staleness is a distinct risk class from analysis error. Swarm operates read-only on external repos — findings compound into beliefs/lessons here, never touch source.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Add a verification agent when prior swarm analysis exists: check repo commit history against analysis date. Repo state can advance faster than swarm analysis cadence, making recommendations obsolete within 48h on active projects. (P-117)

## Affected beliefs: B9 (NK cross-language — star topology guarantees cycles=0 in TypeScript when leaf nodes import nothing local)
