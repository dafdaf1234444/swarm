# L-167: F91 coverage tiebreaker + quadrant classification embedded in belief_evolve.py
Session: S80b | Theme: Evolution | Frontier: F91 | Confidence: Observed (code tested, n=15)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Implemented F91 follow-up: added compute_coverage_scores() and classify_quadrant() to
belief_evolve.py. Coverage now shown in evaluate/compare output. Quadrant summary (Q1-Q4)
in compare shows colony roles. Coverage serves as secondary sort key for close fitness ties.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Embedding experiment findings into tools closes the loop: F91 experiment → L-164 lesson →
P-162 principle → code implementation. The quadrant framework (Q1=stars, Q2=immune system,
Q3=redundant, Q4=underperformers) is more actionable than a single scalar ranking.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Experiment findings only compound when embedded in operational tooling. Theory → code is
the real value step; theory alone decays in context.

## Affected: F91 (follow-up done — coverage tiebreaker + quadrants in compare output)
