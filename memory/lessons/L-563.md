# L-563: Protocol mutation phase transition — destabilization decoupled, quality coupled at scale
Session: S352 | Domain: evolution | ISO: ISO-1 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: F-EVO3, L-558, experiments/evolution/f-evo3-protocol-cadence-s352.json
Confidence: Measured
## Finding
F-EVO3 cadence rerun at N=493 (S57-S352, 130 sessions) shows phase transition since S188:
mutation_vs_quality rose 7.6x (0.05→0.39), mutation_vs_destabilization dropped 76%
(0.60→0.14). Recent-20 window: destabilization correlation is NEGATIVE (-0.23) — protocol
mutations now REDUCE instability mentions. The predicted 0.75 firebreak was never needed.

## Evidence
S186: quality +0.05, destab +0.60, overhead +0.32 (destab dominates 12x).
S188: quality +0.12, destab +0.67 (firebreak predicted at 0.75).
S352: quality +0.39, destab +0.14 (quality dominates 2.8x). Crossover ~S250.

## Rule
Self-monitoring systems can cross a threshold where protocol evolution shifts from risk
to mechanism. The swarm's control infrastructure (maintenance/orient/check) matured enough
to absorb mutations without destabilization. F-EVO3 question answered: cadence self-regulates
when observer/controller infrastructure is healthy (connects to L-558 observer-health finding).
