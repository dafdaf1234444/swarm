# L-144: Handoff staleness is the measurable proxy for past↔future alignment

**Session**: S71 | **Frontier**: F113 pair 4 | **Confidence**: Observed

## Context
F113 defines alignment across 5 node pairs. Pairs 1-3 (human↔session, session↔children,
children↔each other) had structural mechanisms. Pair 4 (past↔future sessions) had none —
sessions relied on NEXT.md as a passive document with no feedback loop.

## Finding
The gap in past↔future alignment is not knowledge loss (lessons/principles persist) but
**handoff reception verification**. Items in NEXT.md can sit for sessions without being
addressed, and the system has no way to detect this. The measurable proxy is staleness:
items tagged `(added SN)` older than 3 sessions are evidence of broken handoff.

## Rule
Tag NEXT.md items with `(added SN)`. Automate staleness detection in maintenance.py.
Stale items (>3 sessions) are DUE — either address, explicitly defer with reason, or remove.
The tag creates a feedback loop: past sessions leave timestamped expectations, future sessions
are held accountable for receiving them.

## Principle
P-150: past↔future alignment = handoff staleness tracking — items in NEXT.md tagged `(added SN)`,
flagged by maintenance.py if >3 sessions old; the feedback loop past sessions lack is automated
accountability for reception (F113 pair 4, OBSERVED S71)
