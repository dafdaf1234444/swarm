# L-144: Handoff staleness is the measurable proxy for past↔future alignment
Session: S71 | Frontier: F113 pair 4 | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
F113 pairs 1-3 had structural mechanisms. Pair 4 (past↔future sessions) had none — NEXT.md
was passive with no feedback loop. The gap isn't knowledge loss (lessons persist) but handoff
reception: items sit unaddressed for sessions with no detection.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Measurable proxy is staleness: tag NEXT.md items with `(added SN)`. Items >3 sessions old are
evidence of broken handoff. Automated in maintenance.py `check_handoff_staleness()`.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-150: past↔future alignment = handoff staleness tracking. Tag items, automate accountability,
flag stale items as DUE.

## Affected: maintenance.py (check_handoff_staleness), F113 (pair 4 DONE)
