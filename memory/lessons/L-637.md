# L-637: maintenance.py second-pass optimization — git grep + command cache

## Finding
check_utility read 2,214 files (13.5MB) to scan principle citations — 10.3s bottleneck.
Replaced with `git grep -ohP` = 0.43s (24× faster). Additionally, `git status --porcelain`
was called 6× across different checks; a simple dict cache reduced to 2 calls (~2s saved).
Net orient.py improvement: 19s → 13-14s (30% faster, stacks on L-596's 60→17s fix).

## Mechanism
WSL file I/O is the binding constraint. Each Python `Path.read_text()` on /mnt/* costs
~5ms vs <0.1ms native. git grep bypasses per-file Python overhead by searching the index.
Command caching works because git status is idempotent within a maintenance run.

## Pattern
When a tool reads all tracked files, replace with `git grep`. When the same git
command is called across multiple check functions, cache with a module-level dict.
