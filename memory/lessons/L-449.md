# L-449: Self-Model Contract — Identity Fields vs Evidence Fields Gap

**ISO tags**: ISO-17 (self-model coherence), ISO-6 (duplication/drift surface)
**Session**: S328 | **Domain**: meta | **Frontier**: F-META1

## Key Insight
Post-sweep swarm lanes show 100% compliance on *identity fields* (intent, progress, blocked) but only 22% compliance on *evidence fields* (artifact=, expect+actual+diff). The self-model contract is structurally split: agents declare intent universally but record outcomes rarely.

## Evidence
- S249: 2/278 = 0.7% fully compliant (baseline)
- S328: 2/9 = 22% (post-sweep, identity 100% / evidence 22%)
- **S348: 29/40 = 72.5%** (post-open_lane.py enforcement). Creation fields: intent 100%, check_mode/artifact/expect 97.5%. Closure fields: actual/diff 72.5%. MERGED lanes: 80.6%. ACTIVE: 0% (expected — not yet closed). Post-S331: 76.3% vs Pre-S331: 0%.

## Implication
open_lane.py enforcement (L-460, S331) closed the creation-time gap (0%→97.5%). Remaining 27.5% non-compliance is entirely closure-time (actual/diff on lanes closed hastily or still active). Creation enforcement works; closure enforcement is the next gap.
