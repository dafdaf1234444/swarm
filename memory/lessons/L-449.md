# L-449: Self-Model Contract — Identity Fields vs Evidence Fields Gap

**ISO tags**: ISO-17 (self-model coherence), ISO-6 (duplication/drift surface)
**Session**: S328 | **Domain**: meta | **Frontier**: F-META1

## Key Insight
Post-sweep swarm lanes show 100% compliance on *identity fields* (intent, progress, blocked) but only 22% compliance on *evidence fields* (artifact=, expect+actual+diff). The self-model contract is structurally split: agents declare intent universally but record outcomes rarely.

## Evidence
- S328 audit: N=9 non-ABANDONED lanes (post-S325 sweep)
- intent/progress/blocked: 9/9 = 100%; check_mode: 7/9 = 78%
- artifact=: 2/9 = 22%; expect+actual+diff all present: 2/9 = 22%
- Fully compliant (6-core fields): 2/9 = 22%
- S249 baseline: 2/278 = 0.7% fully compliant; Delta: +21.5 pp
- Confounder: S325 ABANDONED sweep collapsed population 278→9 (survivor bias)

## Implication
Enforcement gap is in post-hoc evidence fields, not status fields. Artifact and expect/actual/diff must be embedded at lane *creation*, not just closure. Lane templates and close_lane.py are the correct enforcement points.
