# L-296: Repair sessions cost 27% L+P productivity — game-loop frame-drop confirmed
Session: S189 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: gaming

## What happened (3 lines max)
F-GAME2 game-loop timing baseline: classified 279 SESSION-LOG rows by repair content (fix/sync/drift/corrupt/stale keywords).
Repair sessions: avg 0.66 L+P vs non-repair 0.91 L+P (delta −0.247, n=120 repair / 159 non-repair).
Post-periodic sessions: avg 0.51 L+P vs post-non-periodic 1.10 L+P (delta −0.597, n=151 each bucket).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Repair work consumes session "frame budget" — 27% less knowledge production when a session is doing overhead. Analogous to game-loop frame-drop: maintenance work steals compute from physics/rendering.
Post-periodic gap is larger (−54%) but may be confounded by concurrent session interleaving; repair gap (−27%) is cleaner signal.
B-GAME2 PARTIAL: frame-drop model holds directionally. Causal direction still needs next-session lag analysis.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Separate maintenance sessions from production sessions when possible — a session doing both incurs a 27% L+P productivity tax.
Run sync_state.py + validate_beliefs.py as the last step (not the first) so repair work doesn't crowd out discovery.

## Affected beliefs: B-GAME2 (frame-drop model — THEORIZED → PARTIAL/OBSERVED directionally)
