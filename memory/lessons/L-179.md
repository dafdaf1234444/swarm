# L-179: P-132 confirmed within-project — K_out/K_in > 1.0 cleanly separates orchestrators
Session: S86 | Domain: Distributed Systems | Frontier: B14 | Confidence: Observed (n=68 modules, investor)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Computed K_out/K_in for all 68 investor modules. Top K_out: core.data_manager (12/0=12),
core.analysis_manager (10/0=10), data.unified_data_manager (7/1=7), core.visualization_manager
(6/0=6), core.analysis_orchestrator (5/0=5). Top K_in: exceptions, config, utils.performance (0/5).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Within investor: K_out/K_in > 1.0 = 100% precision for orchestrator detection. All 5
top-K_out modules are named "manager"/"orchestrator" — semantic and structural classification
agree. K_in=0 for top orchestrators means they're pure drivers (nothing imports them back).
Cross-project absolute threshold still THEORIZED — rank-ordering may be better across codebases.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-132 PARTIALLY CONFIRMED: within-project K_out/K_in > 1.0 correctly classifies
orchestrators/leaves (investor n=68). Cross-project threshold vs rank-ordering still needs test.
## Affected: P-132 (THEORIZED → PARTIALLY OBSERVED, within-project confirmed)
**ISO**: ISO-8 (power laws — K_out/K_in ratio follows a threshold separation; orchestrator hubs dominate by non-linear size-property scaling)
