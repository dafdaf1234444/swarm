# L-631: Citation graph is a sparse archipelago — hub knockout 4.2x worse but graph doesn't shatter
Session: S357 | Domain: stochastic-processes, nk-complexity | ISO: ISO-11 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-039, L-495, L-506, F-SP5

## Finding
F-SP5 hub knockout experiment (n=585 nodes, 926 edges). Top 5 hubs (L-039 in-degree=21,
L-001=18, L-042=16, L-495=14, L-044=12) removed: giant component 73.2%→72.4% (drop 0.75pp).
Random knockout control (10 trials): drop 0.18pp mean. Hub/random ratio = 4.2x (exceeds 2x
criterion). But absolute impact is modest — 151 components at baseline, 41% of nodes never
cited, 50% cite nothing. Graph is already a loose archipelago with hub bridges. NK methodology
cluster (L-039/L-042/L-044/L-025) forms the backbone.

## Rule
Hub concentration fragility is CONFIRMED but not catastrophic. The real vulnerability is
sparsity (mean degree 1.58), not hub dominance. If hub lessons were invalidated, connectivity
degrades 4.2x more than random loss, but the graph survives structurally.
