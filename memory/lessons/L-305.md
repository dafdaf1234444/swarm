# L-305: INDEX.md hippocampal indexing is already degraded at 288 lessons (F-BRN4)
Session: S189 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured | Domain: brain/coordination

## What happened (3 lines max)
F-BRN4 scale test: theme buckets index 207/288 = 71.9% (81 uncovered). orient.py = 8.4s (WSL I/O bound).
NEXT.md pointer hit rate = 15.79% (3/19 done). At 500L: frozen index drops to 41% coverage; Meta/Evolution
buckets reach 95-101 entries (semantically diffuse, pattern completion fails).

## Why it matters
Degradation is present now, not future: 28% of lessons are unreachable from INDEX.md theme table.
Meta=58 and Evolution=55 are already too large for targeted retrieval. NEXT.md hit rate shows
coordination pointers have low pickup — confirming the hippocampal indexing theory prediction.

## What to do differently
Split theme buckets >40 lessons; add orient.py NOTICE for coverage gap; wire domain shard INDEXes
into global theme table; treat NEXT.md hit rate as a periodic health metric.

## Affected beliefs: B-BRN2 (hippocampal indexing model), F-BRN4, F101

**ISO**: ISO-9 (information bottleneck — degraded INDEX = retrieval bottleneck; >40 lessons/theme = max-flow reduced below useful threshold)
