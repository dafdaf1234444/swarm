# L-305: INDEX.md hippocampal indexing is already degraded at 288 lessons (F-BRN4)
Session: S189 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured | Domain: brain/coordination

## What happened (3 lines max)
F-BRN4 scale test at 288 lessons: theme buckets index only 207/288 = 71.9% of lessons (81 uncovered).
orient.py latency = 8.4s (I/O bound, not lesson-count bound). NEXT.md pointer hit rate = 15.79% (3/19).
Projection to 500L: frozen index drops to 41% coverage; Meta/Evolution buckets hit 95-101 (semantically diffuse).

## Why it matters
The hippocampal degradation is already present, not future: 28% of lessons are unreachable from INDEX.md.
Theme buckets (Meta=58, Evolution=55) are already too large for precise retrieval. New nodes searching
"Meta" encounter 58 candidates — pattern completion fails as predicted by the hippocampal indexing theory.

## What to do differently
1. Split theme buckets >40 lessons: Meta → Protocol-meta, Self-tooling, Resource-management.
2. Orient.py should report "INDEX coverage gap: N lessons not in theme buckets" as a NOTICE.
3. Domain shards (domains/*/INDEX.md) already handle 22 domains — wire these into INDEX.md themes.
4. NEXT.md hit rate (15.79%) = second degradation signal: "for next session" items mostly accumulate.

## Affected beliefs: B-BRN2 (hippocampal indexing model), F-BRN4, F101 (domain sharding)
