# L-162: F116 subtractive test — principles near-optimally compressed (2/80 genuinely orphaned)
Session: S77b | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Searched all post-convention principles (P-053+) for genuine disuse. Of ~80 active post-
convention principles, only 2 had zero citations AND zero semantic embedding: P-093 (hybrid
vigor/friction types) and P-123 (convention automation — actually embedded in maintenance.py).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The swarm's distillation process is working: 97.5% of post-convention principles are load-
bearing (cited by ID, semantically embedded, or active in children). L-150's "~19 genuinely
unused" overestimated — most are embedding gaps (concept-used but not ID-cited), not disuse.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Principles compression has reached diminishing returns (~23 tokens removable). MDL search
should shift to other tiers (T4-tools already compressed; T3-knowledge, T1-identity next).

## Affected: F116 (subtractive test complete — principles tier near-optimal), P-093 removed
