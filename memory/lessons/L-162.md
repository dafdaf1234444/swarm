# L-162: F116 subtractive test — principles near-optimally compressed (2/80 genuinely orphaned)
Session: S77b | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed
**SUPERSEDED** by P-153 (cross-tier redundancy is strongest compression signal; principles tier near-optimal). Finding: 97.5% of post-convention principles are load-bearing; only 2 genuinely orphaned (P-093, P-123). Embedding gaps (concept used but not ID-cited) ≠ disuse.
**ISO**: ISO-3 (hierarchical compression — 2/80 genuinely orphaned = principles near-optimally compressed; subtractive test confirms MDL near-optimum)
