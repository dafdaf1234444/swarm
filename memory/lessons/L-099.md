# L-099: In DAG-enforced Go, errcheck tooling adoption predicts EH quality — not NK metrics
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: 47 | Confidence: theorized (2 frameworks, same domain)

## Context
F100: EH quality predictors in Go. Gin (NK=11) vs Fiber (NK=51), 21 packages scored.

## Lesson
Domain sensitivity is the primary predictor (r=+0.274): security packages avg EH=0.750 vs utility 0.476. NK score (4.6x difference) does NOT predict. errcheck in CI is the enabling mechanism. Key calibration: `_, err = fn()` is CORRECT Go EH (propagates error); `_, _ = fn()` is dangerous.

## Rule extracted
Audit Go EH quality by domain type (security > data-handling > utility), not NK. errcheck CI enforcement creates mandatory review.

## Principles
- **P-105**: In DAG-enforced Go, EH quality primary predictor = domain sensitivity (+0.274): security packages avg 0.750 vs utility 0.476 — review tracks consequence severity, not coupling
- **P-106**: `_, err = fn()` is CORRECT Go EH (propagates error) — truly dangerous is `_, _ = fn()` or uncaptured return
