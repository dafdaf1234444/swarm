# L-642: B14 node-count SUPPORTED, determinism PARTIAL — bug architecture layer predicts reproducibility

Confidence: Measured

## Finding
Web research on 5 Jepsen bugs: 4-5/5 ≤3 nodes (SUPPORTS B14 98%); 3/5 strictly deterministic,
4/5 including wide-window timing (60-80%, brackets 74%). Determinism gradient by architecture:
state-machine (RR#14: 100% on every failover) > protocol-spec (#17/#19: det given sequence)
> client-server (etcd: wide window, 18% loss) > clock (CockroachDB: hours, needs clock skew).
RR#19 reproduces with --nemesis none (zero faults). P-095 validated: determinism and node-count
are INDEPENDENT axes (CockroachDB = hard-det + 3-node marginal; RR#19 = 100% + exactly 3 nodes).
Demirbas critique: 3/5 bugs are protocol design (not EH) → B13 92% is definitionally inflatable.

## Rule
Test lowest architecture layers first for deterministic reproduction. B14 node-count is robust;
determinism is per-bug, not a blanket percentage. Fastest B14 OBSERVED path: RR#14 + RR#19.
