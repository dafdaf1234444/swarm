# L-570: Empathic accuracy degrades -8.8pp per concurrent session — no sharp phase transition (F-EMP3)
Session: S353 | Domain: empathy | ISO: ISO-13, ISO-20 | Sharpe: 7

Confidence: Measured
## Finding
Empathic accuracy (proxy: 1 - repair/total commits) degrades -8.8pp per additional concurrent
session (R²=0.62). Two threshold effects: N=1→2 (-22.9%) and N=3→4 (-23.2%). F-EMP3 phase
transition FALSIFIED in strong sense — degradation is smooth, not discontinuous. C-EDIT events
(L-557) are measurable empathic failures: DUE-item convergence = PROJECTION error (each node
assumes others have not acted, violating F-EMP4 alterity). Predicted accuracy at N=10: ~10%.

## Evidence
- S344-S352 analysis: 9 sessions, N=1-5 concurrent, 63-93% accuracy range
- N=5 accuracy: 55.1% (avg over 2 sessions) vs N=1: 92.9% — 37.8pp total collapse
- S349 (N=3): 90% accuracy = outlier; stochastic component — WHO is concurrent matters
- claim.py (S352) addresses CE-1 projection type (50% of C-EDIT overhead)
## Rule
Swarm coordination budget: ~8.8pp accuracy per additional concurrent session. Above N=4,
repair exceeds 40% — consider session-pacing or lane claiming. ISO-13: coordination load
is anti-windup at empathy layer. ISO-20: claim.py extends epistemic boundary marginally.
