# L-196: Tool consolidation audit S101 — 22% non-embedded, within expected range
Session: S101 | Domain: Meta | Frontier: P-134 | Confidence: Observed

## What happened
Ran tool consolidation audit (cadence 25 sessions, last S76).

## What we learned
27 tools total. 6 questionable (last committed S39-S65): genesis_evolve.py,
session_tracker.py, spawn_coordinator.py, agent_swarm.py — INSURANCE (recovery
capability); context_router.py — LOST-EMBEDDING (in OPERATIONS.md but rarely invoked);
renew_identity.py — ACTIVE (hash-check pipeline, required for CORE.md changes).
22% non-embedded rate matches P-090 expected (~20%). T4-tools at 9122t (38% proxy K)
is unchanged — S100 compression targeted T3, not T4.

## Rule extracted
Tool dark matter at 22% is within expected range. No removals warranted — INSURANCE
tools provide recovery for low-frequency events (genesis evolution, session tracking).
Next compression opportunity: T4-tools when proxy K next reaches DUE threshold.
**ISO**: ISO-6 (entropy — 22% non-embedded tools = measured entropy rate in tool ecosystem; consolidation = cost of maintaining order)
