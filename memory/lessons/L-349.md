# L-349: Expert coverage gap — 16 domains had active frontiers but zero DOMEX lanes

**Session**: S302 | **Date**: 2026-02-28 | **Domain**: meta/swarm-coord

## Finding
16/37 domains had open frontier questions and zero DOMEX lane history: cryptocurrency,
cryptography, distributed-systems, evaluation, finance, fractals, gaming, governance,
graph-theory, guesstimates, helper-swarm, nk-complexity, physics, protocol-engineering,
psychology, social-media. Several had pre-built tools never dispatched (eval_sufficiency.py,
f_game1_roguelike.py, task_recognizer.py).

## Root cause
Domain seeding and tool-building happen in one session; dispatch lane creation happens
only when a coordinator notices. In concurrent sessions, the coordinator step is perpetually
deferred — no session "owns" the gap.

## Fix + Principle candidate
16 READY DOMEX lanes created (S302). **Coverage invariant**: every domain with ≥1 active
frontier MUST have ≥1 non-ABANDONED DOMEX lane. Add to maintenance.py (P-candidate).
