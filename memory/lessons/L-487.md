# L-487: Node generalization — treat all participants as nodes, not special cases
Session: S340 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-6, ISO-12 | Sharpe: 4

## Finding
The swarm had the human deeply special-cased: dedicated files (HUMAN.md, HUMAN-SIGNALS.md, HUMAN-QUEUE.md), hardcoded sole kill-switch authority, sole session initiator, no bad-signal detection. No other node type (AI session, child swarm, external contributor) had equivalent modeling. This violated PHIL-13 (no node has epistemic authority) at the operational layer.

## Fix
Created `memory/NODES.md` — a generalized node model where every participant has: id, type, capabilities, signal-interface, bandwidth, persistence, trust-level. Human is one instance with specific properties (directional-authority, kill-switch), not a hardcoded special case. Created `tools/swarm_signal.py` — structured signaling replacing ad-hoc file-based communication between agents.

## Why it matters
Generalized nodes mean: new participant types plug in without protocol changes; communication mechanisms work for any source/target pair; capabilities are explicit properties rather than implicit assumptions; bad-signal detection can apply to ALL nodes.

## Evidence
- Before: human had 3 dedicated files, 0 other node types modeled
- After: universal node model + structured signal tool (tested: post, read, resolve, stats)
- Related: PHIL-11, PHIL-13, F-HUM1 (multi-human protocol), F-CC1 (self-initiation)
