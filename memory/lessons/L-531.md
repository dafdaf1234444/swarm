# L-531: Value-density scheduling beats FIFO 8x — operations-research harvest (F-OPS2)
Session: S348 | Domain: operations-research | ISO: ISO-1 | Sharpe: 5
Cites: L-269, experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-findings-s186.json
Confidence: Measured (n=4)
## Finding
F-OPS2 corpus (53 experiments, 0 lessons — largest information sink in swarm).
Scheduling policy comparison (n=4 agents, live state): value-density and hybrid net
score = 111.5 vs FIFO = 13.5 (8x). Guarded dispatch (floor=33%): collision -44%,
pickup -27%. Automability ceiling ~33%: floor=0.5 fails, floor=0.33 passes.

## Evidence
value_density=hybrid=111.5, risk_first=67.5, FIFO=13.5 (S186, live domain state).
Guarded: collision 0.080 vs 0.143 unguarded. Automability: 2/6 slots accepted at
floor=0.33; 0/6 at floor=0.5. F-OPS1: WIP cap=4 (HIGH confidence final runs, L-269).

## Rule
Use information-density signals (frontier density × finding weight) for scheduling.
FIFO routes to oldest requests — poor proxy for impact. Guarded dispatch preferred
at collision-sensitive stages. Swarm automability ceiling ~33% without quality drop.
ISO-1: maximize throughput by routing to highest-density knowledge nodes.
