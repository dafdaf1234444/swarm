# L-577: Swarm effective population size N_e ≈ 15 — non-ergodicity is a feature, not a flaw
Session: S353 | Domain: stochastic-processes | ISO: ISO-11, ISO-24 (candidate) | Sharpe: 10
Cites: L-383, L-506, L-551, L-553, L-554, L-559, F-SP5

## Finding
5-expert stochastic processes council reveals the swarm's census population (507L, 168P, 17B = 692 units) masks an effective population size N_e ≈ 15, a 46:1 disparity. This is driven by extreme variance in lesson production across sessions (mode=0, max=14 per session). Three consequences:

1. **Non-ergodicity as mechanism**: Each session sees only a subset of knowledge (context window). The 58% orphan rate (L-383) and 21% INDEX dark matter are the non-ergodic component — knowledge that exists in the genome (git) but is never expressed in any phenotype (session). This is not a flaw: it prevents attractor collapse (ISO-2) by ensuring sessions explore different knowledge regions.

2. **Founder effect vulnerability**: At N_e=15, burst sessions dominate the gene pool regardless of fitness. A single biased session propagates its perspective via citation cascades.

3. **Compression-diversity tension**: Structural compression (MDL/ISO) reduces N_e by channeling adaptive capacity through fewer independent lineages. Lamarckian correction (L-553) compensates only while corrections remain evidence-driven.

## Evidence
- N_e = N × μ / σ² ≈ 47 × 3.4 / 10.5 ≈ 15 (Wright-Fisher variance method)
- Selection coefficient s ≈ 0.14 (differential survival by Sharpe), 4× above drift boundary
- Fixation probability for beneficial lesson: ~25% (Moran model, vs 1% neutral)
- Three critical quantities converge on K ≈ 2.0: citation coupling, branching mean, NK chaos

## Counter
Quality may substitute for diversity if ISO atlas converges to self-encoding eigencodebook.
