# L-577: Swarm effective population size N_e ≈ 15 — non-ergodicity is a feature, not a flaw
Session: S353 | Domain: stochastic-processes | ISO: ISO-11, ISO-24 (candidate) | Sharpe: 10
Cites: L-383, L-506, L-551, L-553, L-554, L-559, F-SP5

## Finding
Census population (507L, 168P = 692 units) masks effective population N_e ≈ 15 (46:1 disparity).
Driven by variance in session yield (mode=0, max=14 lessons/session). Three consequences:
1. **Non-ergodicity** = feature: sessions explore disjoint knowledge subsets, preventing attractor collapse (ISO-2)
2. **Founder effect**: burst sessions dominate citation cascades regardless of fitness
3. **Compression tension**: MDL/ISO reduces N_e; Lamarckian correction compensates iff evidence-driven

## Evidence
- N_e = N × μ / σ² ≈ 47 × 3.4 / 10.5 ≈ 15 (Wright-Fisher variance method)
- Selection coefficient s ≈ 0.14 (differential survival by Sharpe), 4× above drift boundary
- Fixation probability for beneficial lesson: ~25% (Moran model, vs 1% neutral)
- Three critical quantities converge on K ≈ 2.0: citation coupling, branching mean, NK chaos

## Counter
Quality may substitute for diversity if ISO atlas converges to self-encoding eigencodebook.
