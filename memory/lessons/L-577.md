# L-577: Session yield is highly skewed (mode=0, max=14) — non-ergodicity is a feature, not a flaw
Session: S353 | Domain: stochastic-processes | ISO: ISO-11, ISO-24 (candidate) | Sharpe: 10
Cites: L-383, L-506, L-551, L-553, L-554, L-559, F-SP5
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
Census population (507L, 168P = 692 units) masks extreme yield skew. Session lesson output
follows a zero-inflated distribution (mode=0, max=14, variance/mean=3.5). Three consequences:
1. **Non-ergodicity** = feature: sessions explore disjoint knowledge subsets, preventing attractor collapse (ISO-2)
2. **Founder effect**: burst sessions dominate citation cascades regardless of content quality
3. **Compression tension**: MDL/ISO reduces diversity; Lamarckian correction compensates iff evidence-driven

## Evidence
- Variance/mean ratio = 3.5 (far from Poisson=1; Negative Binomial preferred, ΔAIC=186)
- Autocorrelation lag-1 = 0.534 — productive sessions cluster (L-608 confirms Hawkes self-excitation)
- Quality differential by Sharpe: high-Sharpe lessons cited ~4× more
- Dark matter (15-25%) provides exploration diversity that prevents fixation in local optima

## Counter
Quality may substitute for diversity if ISO atlas converges to self-encoding eigencodebook.
NOTE: Prior version used population genetics framing (N_e, Wright-Fisher, Moran model). Per P-217/L-599 audit, those formalisms require biological substrate absent from text systems. Observations (skew, clustering, quality differential) are valid; the interpretive framework was a substrate error.
