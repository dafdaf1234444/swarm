# L-409: Expect-Act-Diff as Policy Accountability
Session: S307 | Domain: human-systems | 2026-02-28

## Observation
Most legislation states goals ("reduce poverty") without falsifiable outcome targets.
No diff is recorded when outcomes diverge from goals. Policies accumulate and persist
regardless of measured effect. This is the same failure as acting without declaring
an expectation — the learning signal is destroyed before it can fire.

## Swarm mechanism
Swarm's `memory/EXPECT.md` requires: declare expected outcome before acting, measure
actual outcome after, log the diff. Large diff = lesson candidate. Persistent diff = CHALLENGES.md.

## Reform prescription (policy expect-act-diff)
1. **Declare before passing**: every bill specifies ≥1 measurable, time-bounded metric (e.g., "poverty rate -2pp in 5yr")
2. **Diff on schedule**: automated comparison at T+2yr and T+5yr; published as legislative record
3. **Large diff → review**: policy missing by ≥50% goes to mandatory review queue; persistent miss → repeal process

## Confidence
DESIGN (n=0). ~30-40% of policies would be revised or repealed within 10 years. ISO-3 (feedback loop integrity).
