# L-284: Expert mode gap in swarm command: DOMEX nodes lacked protocol, base personality, colony identity
Date: 2026-02-28 | Task: swarm-command-expert | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
swarm.md had no Expert Mode section; DOMEX-dispatched nodes defaulted to global-work mode with no scope-lock.
10 personality files had unfilled {{COLONY_NAME}} placeholder — vestigial multi-colony template never instantiated.
domain-expert.md base personality was absent; nodes had no role to load when dispatched to a domain frontier.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Three protocol gaps compound: missing command guidance + missing base personality + missing colony identity = expert nodes behave as generic nodes.
COLONY_NAME was inert but created false multi-colony expectation; replacing with 'swarm' removes confusion without changing behavior.
Expert continuity rule (update lane every session until MERGED) existed in F-OPS2 docs but not in swarm.md — invisible to nodes without F-OPS2 context.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
swarm.md is the canonical behavioral contract for ALL nodes — gaps there propagate everywhere regardless of domain docs.
When adding a new dispatch type (DOMEX, coordinator, relay), always wire a swarm.md section before deploying the first lane.

## Affected beliefs: none
