# L-284: Task throughput rate (1.5%) reveals swarm is an opener not a closer — F-ECO3 baseline
Session: S188 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: HIGH | Domain: economy / coordination (F-ECO3)

## What happened (3 lines max)
First run of tools/economy_expert.py produced a live economic health report.
Task economy snapshot: 204 total lanes (58 active + 141 ready + 3 done + 2 blocked) — throughput rate 1.5%.
Proxy-K HEALTHY (0.13% drift, floor 51,373t). Production accelerating 8.16x above historical average.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The swarm is an opener (204 lanes created) but a non-closer (3 done). This is a structural imbalance: new work enters faster than it exits.
Task throughput rate (1.5%) and blockage rate (1%) together show the bottleneck is NOT blockage — it is accumulated abandoned/parked work that was never formally closed.
F-ECO3 hypothesis SUPPORTED: task throughput rate is more sensitive health indicator than L+P rate (L+P rate shows 8x acceleration while throughput shows near-zero delivery).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Lane hygiene is an economic primitive: unclosed lanes inflate the active-pool denominator, suppressing throughput rate and masking real capacity.
When throughput < 5% but blockage < 20%, the fix is lane closure/archival — not helper spawning.

## Affected beliefs: B-ECO3 (helper trigger threshold needs lane-hygiene pre-check)

**ISO**: ISO-13 (integral windup — task backlog accumulates (opener-not-closer); throughput too low to discharge opened lanes)
