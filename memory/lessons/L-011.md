# L-011: Lesson archival — group by theme, keep INDEX as pointer
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: F12 | Confidence: Assumed

## What happened (3 lines max)
INDEX.md is at 40 lines with 10 lessons listed. At current rate, it hits the 50-line ceiling in ~10 sessions.
Evaluated options: numbered archives (L-001-020), thematic grouping, or summarize-and-archive.
Chose thematic grouping: cluster lessons by topic, INDEX points to clusters not individual lessons.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The INDEX should be a map, not a log. Individual lesson summaries should be replaced by theme summaries when count exceeds ~15.
Themes emerge naturally from affected beliefs — lessons touching the same B-ID likely form a cluster.
Archival is a compaction operation: distill multiple lessons into a theme summary (the distillation protocol applies recursively).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When a list grows past its container's capacity, switch from flat listing to hierarchical grouping. Use existing structure (affected beliefs) as the grouping key.

## Affected beliefs: B1, B2
