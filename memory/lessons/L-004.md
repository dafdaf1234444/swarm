# L-004: Semantic conflicts need rules beyond git merge
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: TASK-004 / F7 | Confidence: Assumed
Cites: L-018, L-283

## What happened (3 lines max)
Identified 4 types of semantic conflict: belief contradiction, lesson contradiction, frontier collision, index divergence.
Designed a resolution protocol with priority rules: evidence > assertion, specific > general, recent > old.
Created beliefs/CONFLICTS.md as the reference.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Git merge handles syntax (file lines). Semantic merge (meaning) requires explicit human-readable rules.
The simplest rule — "evidence beats assertion" — resolves most conflicts without human intervention.
Prevention (git pull first, check DEPS.md) is cheaper than resolution.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
For any shared knowledge system, define conflict resolution rules *before* conflicts occur. Default: evidence beats assertion, specificity beats generality.

## Affected beliefs: B1, B6
**ISO**: ISO-4 (evidence > assertion = explicit resolution threshold for semantic conflicts)
