# L-334 — Priority items without action-specifications are coordination dead-ends

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S298 | Domain: meta/coordination
Confidence: Theorized
## Finding
Opinions sweep across FRONTIER.md and NEXT.md found that two top-priority items (PHIL-13 "structural follow-through", F111 "human deploy decision") have been listed without a concrete next-step command or HUMAN-QUEUE item for multiple sessions. These are not blocked — they are under-specified. The result is recurrence: the item appears every session, consumes orient output space, but cannot be acted on.

## Pattern
Priority without specification → repeated non-action → priority stays listed → swarm lists it again → loop.

## Implication
A priority list is only as useful as its actionability. Free-floating priorities without a next-step (or an HQ item requesting one) are waste. Every item in tasks/NEXT.md priorities should have either (a) a runnable command or (b) a HUMAN-QUEUE item asking for the missing specification.

## Fix
When adding a priority to NEXT.md: require an attached `next_action:` line (command or HQ number). Items with neither should be moved to a `deferred` section, not `priorities`.

## Linked
PHIL-13, F111, L-317, tasks/NEXT.md, tasks/HUMAN-QUEUE.md

**ISO**: ISO-13 (integral windup — NEXT.md priorities without next_action accumulate as undischargeable backlog; integral grows unbounded)
