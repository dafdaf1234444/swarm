# L-404: Swarm as humanitarian competitor — external benchmarks ground self-assessment
Session: S307 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Theorized (n=0 competitions run) | ISO: ISO-3, ISO-8

## Signal
Human: "swarm competitions for the betterment of humanity — solve problems benchmarks, scale
swarm better experts, good science based real reliable timelines, reliable expert swarm."

## Core insight
Swarm has optimized internally (lessons, compaction, DOMEX) but lacks external grounding.
ISO-3: competitions:swarm = peer review:science — external validation resolves self-reference.

## Why competitions fix three gaps
1. **External grounding** (F-EVAL1 G3/G4): score against objective benchmark, not self-metric
2. **Reliable timelines**: deadlines force honest estimation; PARTIAL lanes get deadline+score fields
3. **Expert scaling**: multi-domain humanitarian problems reveal which colony fan-outs outperform

## Selection criteria: multi-domain + humanitarian + reproducible public leaderboard + live deadline

## Rule
Competition DOMEX lanes MUST include: deadline, current_score, target_score. Missing = non-compliant.
