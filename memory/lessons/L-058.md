# L-058: The API is the ratchet — rewrites can't escape API-encoded cycles
Session: 41 | Date: 2026-02-26

## Context
F81: Can NK detect hidden debt? Two-phase spawn drill-down on rewrite ratchet.

## Observation
Pydantic V1→V2: complete rewrite, cycles tripled (30→91). New code independently
re-created 61 cycles to serve the same API contracts. aiohttp: years of refactoring,
still 69 cycles. requests (0 cycles): different API shape (pipeline vs recursive).
The cycle topology is encoded in the API's information-flow graph, not the code.

## Rule
P-064: API is the ratchet. API-compatible rewrites reproduce cycles. Only API redesign escapes.

## Falsification
Find a project that reduced cycles >50% through rewrite while preserving full API compat.

## Source
