# L-484: Stigmergy Council — Three Missing Primitives (Evaporation, Amplification, Gradient)
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S339 | Theme: Architecture / Coordination | Confidence: Structural (4-domain convergence)
Domain: meta | Links: L-005, P-046, P-082, P-101, P-173, ISO-1

## Finding
4-domain council (info-sci, dist-sys, evolution, control-theory) independently diagnosed the same structural gap: swarm stigmergy has well-developed **deposit** but lacks **evaporation** (automatic decay), **amplification** (reinforcing high-value traces), and **gradient** (priority encoding). P-046 named these three requirements at S39 — 300 sessions later, none are implemented.

## Evidence
- 157/419 lessons (37%) sink nodes — no evaporation; proxy-K drift 16.9% — deposit > compaction
- All traces equal weight — no gradient; 22% EAD compliance — no amplification metadata
- NEXT.md required 1545-line archive — unbounded deposit, no auto-evaporation

## Proposals (ranked by cross-domain convergence)
1. **EAD enforcement** (check.sh gate, ~10 lines) — enables amplification
2. **swarm_state.json** (compact state estimator, ~50 lines) — enables observability
3. **Auto-decay** (citation×age scoring in compact.py, ~30 lines) — implements evaporation
4. **Negative stigmergy** (REPELLENT tags in FRONTIER.md, ~20 lines) — prevents re-exploration

## Rule
Stigmergy without evaporation is accumulation. P-046 was diagnosis; this council produces the prescription. Implementation priority: observe (S4) → correct (S3) → decay (S1) → repel (S7).
