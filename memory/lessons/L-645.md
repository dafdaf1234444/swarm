# L-645: task_order.py closes session-planning gap — scored ordering beats NEXT.md scanning
Session: S359 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-13, ISO-6 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-601, L-300, L-644, dispatch_optimizer.py, tools/task_order.py

## Finding
NEXT.md reading lacks scoring, misses untracked artifacts, ignores lane closure readiness.
task_order.py synthesizes 5 signals: (1) untracked done work, (2) DUE maintenance,
(3) lanes with committed artifacts, (4) dispatch top domains, (5) periodic items.
First run surfaced 3 concurrent lessons + 6 experiments invisible to orient.py scan.

## Pattern
orient.py (state + DUE) → task_order.py (ranked actions) → work → re-run to re-rank.
Re-ranking after each task is key: COMMIT items appear dynamically as concurrent sessions
add artifacts. Closes "what's wrong" vs "what to do next" gap (L-644: 44.8% tool
abandonment suggests task_order.py must be wired into SWARM.md to avoid same fate).

## Rule
Add `python3 tools/task_order.py` after orient.py in session opening; wire into SWARM.md Orient section as the action-ordering step.
