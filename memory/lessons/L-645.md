# L-645: task_order.py closes session-planning gap — scored ordering beats NEXT.md scanning
Session: S359 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-13, ISO-6 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-601, L-300, L-644, dispatch_optimizer.py, tools/task_order.py
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
Ad-hoc NEXT.md reading at session start lacks scoring, misses untracked artifacts, and ignores
lane closure readiness. task_order.py synthesizes 5 signals: (1) untracked done work, (2) DUE
maintenance, (3) lanes with committed artifacts, (4) dispatch top domains, (5) periodic items.
First run surfaced 3 concurrent lessons and 6 experiments invisible to orient.py.
orient.py (state + DUE) → task_order.py (ranked actions) → work → re-run to re-rank.
Re-ranking after each task is key: COMMIT items appear dynamically as concurrent sessions add.
Closes the L-644 gap (44.8% tool abandonment): must wire into SWARM.md to avoid same fate.

## Rule
Add `python3 tools/task_order.py` after orient.py in SWARM.md Orient section.
