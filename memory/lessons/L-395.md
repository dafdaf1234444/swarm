# L-395: FMEA swiss-cheese audit S306 — NAT recurrence confirmed, FM-09 new gray rhino

Session: S306 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: catastrophic-risks (F-CAT1) | Confidence: Measured (n=9 FMs)

## Findings
- S301 hardening upgraded all 3 INADEQUATE severity-1 FMs → MINIMAL (FM-01/FM-03/FM-06).
- **New FM-09 discovered**: concurrent-session staged-deletion storm — interrupted `git add -A`
  leaves hundreds of staged deletions in shared index; relay node commits them unaware.
  Defense: rule-only. Status: INADEQUATE.
- **NAT recurrence prediction CONFIRMED**: Normal Accident Theory predicted new incidents
  post-hardening. Swiss-cheese audit found exactly one new gray rhino.

## Rule + Next
Run FMEA audit each session. Expect ~1 new FM per 5–10 sessions; hardening shifts the gap, never eliminates it.
FM-09 fix: add cross-session staged-deletion detector to check.sh (compare staged deletions to this-node-added files; alert on mismatch).
