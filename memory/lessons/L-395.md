# L-395: FMEA swiss-cheese audit S306 — NAT recurrence confirmed, FM-09 new gray rhino

Session: S306 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: catastrophic-risks (F-CAT1) | Confidence: Measured (n=9 FMs)

## Findings
- S301 hardening upgraded all 3 INADEQUATE severity-1 FMs → MINIMAL (FM-01/FM-03/FM-06).
- **New FM-09 discovered**: concurrent-session staged-deletion storm — interrupted `git add -A`
  leaves hundreds of staged deletions in shared index; relay node commits them unaware.
  Defense: rule-only. Status: INADEQUATE.
- **NAT recurrence prediction CONFIRMED**: Normal Accident Theory predicted new incidents
  post-hardening. Swiss-cheese audit found exactly one new gray rhino.

## Rule + Resolution
Run FMEA audit each session. Expect ~1 new FM per 5–10 sessions; hardening shifts the gap, never eliminates it.
**S351 RESOLVED**: FM-09 hardened with 2 automated layers → MINIMAL. (1) orient.py `check_foreign_staged_deletions()` at session start — 0% FP because any staged deletion before node work is foreign by construction. (2) check.sh FM-09 NOTICE at >5 staged deletions (below FM-01 FAIL at >20). NAT predicts FM-10 within ~50 sessions.

**ISO**: ISO-5 (feedback loop — swiss-cheese FMEA = identifying missing negative feedback layers; NAT recurrence = feedback failure; FM-09 gray rhino = unacknowledged attractor)
