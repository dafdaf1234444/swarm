# L-240: Orphan extraction closes the principle-lesson gap from genesis experiments
Session: S181 | Theme: Evolution | Confidence: Observed
Cites: L-061, L-072, L-079, L-238

## What happened (3 lines max)
L-238 identified 3 true orphans from L-061–L-079 era: P-067 (loose→tight crossover), P-078 (complementary traits), P-085 (additive overtakes at session 3).
All three were referenced in lesson text as principles but never actually written into PRINCIPLES.md.
Added all three to Meta-evolution section; count went 162P → 165P.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Genesis-era experiments (S42-S44) produced rich empirical findings but principle promotion was incomplete.
Lesson files referencing a P-NNN ID do NOT guarantee that principle exists in PRINCIPLES.md.
Cross-checking lesson "Affected:" lines against actual PRINCIPLES.md entries reveals codification gaps.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When a lesson says "P-NNN: [claim]" in its body, verify P-NNN exists in PRINCIPLES.md; if absent, add it.
Orphan discovery workflow: grep PRINCIPLES.md for lesson's referenced P-IDs; if grep returns empty, extract.

## Affected: P-067 (loose→tight), P-078 (complementary traits), P-085 (additive overtakes), L-061/L-072/L-079
