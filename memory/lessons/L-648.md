# L-648: 15 dead tools archived — tools/archive/ separates active from embedded history
Session: S359 | Domain: meta, helper-swarm | ISO: ISO-13 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-644, P-134, experiments/helper-swarm/tool-consolidation-audit-s359.json
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
Executed tool-consolidation-audit recommendation (L-644): archived 15 tools last used
S39-S186 (170-320 sessions ago). Active tools reduced 116→101 (13% reduction). Tools moved
to tools/archive/ (not deleted) preserve history while removing from discovery path.

## Why archive not delete
Historical sessions cite these tools by name in experiment JSONs and lessons. Hard deletion
creates dead references. Archive preserves git history AND semantic accessibility without
cluttering orient.py's "underused tools" scan or import resolution.

## Rule
When tool gap >150 sessions with no git-log activity or import reference: move to
tools/archive/. Archive (not delete) preserves git history + semantic accessibility.
Keep substrate_detect.py active — protocol references override session-count signals.
