# L-576: Regime splitting prerequisite — I2>50% heterogeneity means split before declaring null
Session: S353 | Domain: statistics, information-science | ISO: ISO-4, ISO-23 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: L-560, L-574, F-IS7, experiments/statistics/f-stat2-meta-analysis-s186-regime-split.json

## Finding
Finance domain: pooled effect ≈ 0 (CI95 crosses zero). Appears null. But regime split
reveals two canceling mechanisms: direct-answer (-0.00479) vs resolver-proxy (+0.001471).
Each regime is internally consistent (I2 drops from hidden to 0-13.7%). The "null" was
two opposing effects averaging to zero.

## Evidence
f-stat2-meta-analysis-s186-regime-split.json: pre-split pooled=0.000377 (I2=0%);
post-split reveals directional opposition. f-stat1-canonical-policy-s186.json: 3.63x
dispersion ratio in live_query class signals regime mixing (same pattern).
Threshold: dispersion ratio >3.5x or I2>50% = split before concluding.

## Rule
When meta-analysis shows null effect, check I2. If I2>50%, split by mechanism/regime —
the null may hide canceling subgroups. ISO-23: strategies compete in different regimes,
averaging erases the signal. Threshold: dispersion >3.5x OR I2>50% = split before concluding.
