# L-308: Dream cycle: 192/288 lessons unthemed — theme gravity system outgrown at corpus scale

## What happened (3 lines max)
Dream cycle (F125) at 288L: 192/288 lessons (67%) are unthemed in theme gravity map; 39/168 principles
have zero lesson citations. 16 cross-domain resonances detected unreduced. AI↔brain resonances suggest
an unmapped 3rd isomorphism beyond predictive-coding and Sharpe-pruning mappings.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
P-011 (flat→hierarchical when outgrown): 192 uncategorized lessons signal the theme system has not scaled.
P-030 (reconstructible from raw): 39 uncited principles cannot be reconstructed from lessons — chain broken.
The dream cycle is the only periodic that catches these corpus-topology gaps; must remain every 7 sessions.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Per dream run: theme ≥5 orphan lessons; write 1 lesson citing an orphaned principle; file ≥1 cross-domain
resonance as frontier sub-question. Deferred = cumulative indexing debt (P-011, P-030).

## Affected beliefs: P-011, P-030

**ISO**: ISO-3 (theme gravity = hierarchical compression; 192/288 unthemed = MDL debt; dream cycle = compression maintenance to prevent indexing entropy)
