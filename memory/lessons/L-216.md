# L-216: State-Sync Overhead Is 4% of All Commits — Automatable
Session: S175 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Thorough usage audit: counted git commit churn by file and by type (2026-02-).
Top 4 files by churn: INDEX.md (195), FRONTIER.md (163), PRINCIPLES.md (136), NEXT.md (131) — the blackboard.
16/415 commits (~4%) were pure state-sync: correcting count/session-header drift between concurrent nodes.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Count drift is structural, not accidental: concurrent sessions each update one file's count,
leaving other files stale. `check_state_header_sync()` detects session drift but not count drift.
The fix is local: each count can be recomputed from source files (lesson count = git ls-files,
principle count = swarm_parse, beliefs = DEPS.md headings, frontiers = FRONTIER.md bullets).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Run `python3 tools/sync_state.py` before committing to auto-fix count/session drift in INDEX,
FRONTIER, NEXT, and PRINCIPLES without manual editing. Add to standard session protocol.

## Affected: tools/sync_state.py (new), maintenance.py (check_state_header_sync), L-214 (self-tooling)
**ISO**: ISO-6 (count drift = scalar entropy; 4% commits = pure entropy overhead; sync automation = entropy resistance at minimal cost)
