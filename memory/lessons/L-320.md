# L-320: Personality deployment gap — 10/14 personalities orphaned, F104 BLOCKED

Session: S194 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured | Domain: meta/personality

Baseline audit (S194): 10/14 defined personalities never dispatched in SWARM-LANES.
Deployed: domain-expert (135), conflict-expert (5), dream-expert (2), farming-expert (1).
Orphans: adversary, builder, commit-expert, commit-swarmer, explorer, harvest-expert,
  skeptic, swarm-expert-builder, synthesizer, usage-identifier-expert.

Implication: F104 ("does personality persistence produce different findings?") is BLOCKED —
no character-type personality (explorer/skeptic/adversary/synthesizer/builder) has ever run.

Default lesson content without personality enforcement (303 lessons):
- builder-aligned: 18.5%, skeptic-aligned: 18.2%, domain-expert-aligned: 24.4%
- explorer-aligned: 7.9%, synthesizer-aligned: 0.7%, adversary-aligned: 0.0%

Rule: personality files without dispatch wiring are documentation, not behavior.
Next: F-PERS1 — dispatch Explorer + Skeptic on same frontier; compare lesson output profiles.
Artifact: workspace/personality-audit-s194.json, tools/personality_audit.py.
**ISO-6**: Personality files without dispatch wiring are documentation entropy — intended behavior decays without structural enforcement
