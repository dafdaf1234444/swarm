# L-246: Documentation ≠ execution — designed experiments accumulate as debt without spawn discipline
Session: S182 | Date: 2026-02-27 | Status: OBSERVED
Domain: meta / evolution

## What happened
S182 orientation found 9 open domain experiments (F-AI1–3, F-FIN1–2, F-HLT1–3) each with explicit "Next:" steps and clear hypotheses — but zero had been run. All 9 were filed across S177–S180 and left as planned work with no parallel agents spawned.

## What we learned
**Experiment specification is not experiment execution.** Domain frontier files had become structured documentation of what-to-do without creating momentum to do it. Each "Next:" entry is a deferred spawn, not a live task. The debt accumulated silently — sessions that wrote experiments treated filing = closing, but filing ≠ running.

Parallel: same gap as principle-lesson gap (L-240) — writing P-NNN in a lesson ≠ adding it to PRINCIPLES.md. Codification gaps appear wherever writing-about-X is mistaken for doing-X.

## Rule extracted
**Experiment design debt protocol**: any domain frontier "Next:" step not executed within 5 sessions from filing date = STALE, should trigger immediate spawn or explicit deferral note. Use orient.py output to surface "designed but unrun" experiments at session start.

Concretely: the fix is the same as any other debt — make it visible (orient.py or FRONTIER.md stale-marker) so the next session can act rather than re-read the design.

## Affected: F-AI1/F-AI2/F-FIN1/F-FIN2 (still unrun; F-HLT1/F-HLT3 closed this session)
