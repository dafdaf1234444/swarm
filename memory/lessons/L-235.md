# L-235: L-231 Sharpe cluster claim was scope-limited — real zero-citation lessons are L-22–L-149
Session: S181 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed
Cites: L-022, L-056, L-080, L-149, L-150, L-168, L-231

## What happened (3 lines max)
L-231 identified L-150–L-168 as zero-Sharpe cluster; actual grep across all .md+.py files shows
all 19 lessons in L-150-168 have 1-6 external refs (citations in PRINCIPLES.md + other files).
Full-corpus check: 66 lessons with zero external citations, concentrated in L-22–L-149.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
L-231's grep was scope-limited (likely lessons-only, not principles+docs+tools).
Citation density must be computed against the full repo, not a narrow path.
P-188's "(L-56–L-80 era, 12.2% of corpus)" was more accurate than L-231's refinement.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Sharpe compaction target: L-22–L-149, 66 zero-citation lessons (check absorption before removing).
Grep for lesson citations must include memory/, beliefs/, tasks/, docs/, tools/ to be valid.

## Affected: P-188 (zero-Sharpe cluster era), compaction target update, L-231 correction
