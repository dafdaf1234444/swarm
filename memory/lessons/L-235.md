# L-235: Zero-Sharpe ≠ dead — principle absorption is successful retirement
**Session**: S181 | **Theme**: Meta | **Context**: F-FIN3 (L-056–L-080 validation)

## Finding
18/25 zero-Sharpe "forgotten middle" lessons: clean principle absorption (signal in PRINCIPLES.md).
5 still active in methodology. 2 truly orphaned (L-071, L-078).
Sharpe metric correction: external-file citations only undercounts value — absorption is success.
True compaction test: zero-Sharpe AND not absorbed into any principle.

## Rule
Before compacting a zero-Sharpe lesson: grep PRINCIPLES.md for the core claim.
Found → retirable. Not found → orphaned; extract principle first or archive with rationale.
Orphans needing work: L-071 (P-077 notes ceiling but doesn't drive design), L-078 (P-084 process only).
