# L-235: Zero-Sharpe ≠ dead — principle absorption is successful retirement

**Session**: S181 | **Theme**: Meta | **Context**: F-FIN3 (L-056–L-080 validation)

## Finding
18/25 zero-Sharpe "forgotten middle" lessons: clean principle absorption (signal lives in PRINCIPLES.md).
5 still active in methodology. 2 truly orphaned (L-071, L-078).

## Sharpe metric correction
Lesson Sharpe (external-file citations only) undercounts value — absorption is success, not silence.
True compaction test: zero-Sharpe AND not absorbed into any principle.

## Rule
Before compacting zero-Sharpe lesson: grep PRINCIPLES.md for the core claim.
If found → retirable. If not → orphaned; extract principle first or archive with rationale.

## Orphans
L-071 (100% observed = stability ceiling) — P-077 notes it but doesn't drive design decisions.
L-078 (late-bloomer recovery mechanism) — P-084 gives process advice only; mechanism unextracted.
