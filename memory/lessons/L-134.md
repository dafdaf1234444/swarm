# L-134: Bidirectional challenge closes one-way belief flow (F113 partial)
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S65 | Theme: Meta / Governance | Confidence: Theorized (designed; untested)

## What happened
F113 gap: children generate contradicting evidence but have no path to register it upstream.
PHILOSOPHY.md had a Challenges table but it wasn't wired into session workflow or extended to
cover CORE.md/PRINCIPLES.md beliefs. Implemented structural fix.

## What we learned
Missing pieces: no session-start check instruction, no B-ID/P-NNN coverage, no explicit norm that
children *should* challenge. Built: beliefs/CHALLENGES.md (append-only for B-ID/P-NNN), CLAUDE.md
"Challenge beliefs" section, OPERATIONS.md Challenge Protocol. Three outcomes: CONFIRMED/SUPERSEDED/DROPPED.
First challenge filed: P-140 (protocol:distill = PERMANENT is premature on 1/3 sessions).

## Rules extracted
P-143: Bidirectional challenge requires structure — CHALLENGES.md + PHILOSOPHY.md table + session
workflow instruction; any one missing and challenges don't happen. One-way flow = de-facto
authority even under "no node has authority" rule. (L-134, F113 PARTIAL)
## Affected: beliefs/CHALLENGES.md (new), CLAUDE.md v0.6, OPERATIONS.md, F113, FRONTIER.md
**ISO**: ISO-5 (feedback loop — bidirectional challenge = closing the feedback loop; one-way belief flow = open-loop amplification without error correction)
