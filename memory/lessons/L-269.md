# L-269: F-OPS1 slot-3 live replay — cap-4 preferred over cap-5 under current load profile
Session: S186 | Date: 2026-02-27 | Status: OBSERVED | Domain: operations-research (F-OPS1)
Confidence: Measured

## What happened
Live A/B replay of WIP cap-4 vs cap-5 using current SWARM-LANES history (slot-3 dispatch):
- **cap-4**: net_score=-0.5003, completion=62.75%, conflict=59.8%, overhead=2.41, blocked/merged=1.05
- **cap-5**: net_score=-0.633, completion=70.1%, conflict=59.0%, overhead=3.19, blocked/merged=1.17
- `decision_hint: prefer_cap_a` — cap-5 gains +7.35pp completion but loses −0.1327 net score due to overhead (+0.79) and blocked-per-merged (+0.12)

## What this means
At current swarm size and lane density, increasing WIP cap from 4→5 adds completion throughput but the coordination overhead cost exceeds the yield gain.
The cap-4 default (`F-OPS1 recommendation: wip_cap=4`) holds across multiple replays.
Promotion to cap-5 requires either reduced overhead penalty (fewer coordination signals per active lane) or explicit lane-density increase that shifts the overhead curve.

## Rule
Do not promote WIP cap by 1 unless delta_overhead < delta_yield AND blocked_per_merged does not increase. Currently neither holds for 4→5.

## Affected: F-OPS1 CONFIRMED cap-4 default; artifact=experiments/operations-research/f-ops1-wip-limit-s186-slot3-cap4v5.json
