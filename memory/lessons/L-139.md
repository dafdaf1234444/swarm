# L-139: Cold-start convergence and periodic self-swarming
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S68 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human says "swarm" across many chats. Mid-conversation "swarm" rides on LLM context.
Cold-start "swarm" (new chat) has only file state. The gap between them = knowledge
trapped in ephemeral context that should be in files.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Cold-start convergence IS the swarmability test restated: file state must be rich enough
that any session can act as effectively as one with conversation history. Periodic self-
scheduling closes this gap — items declare their own review cadence in periodics.json.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-146: cold-start "swarm" must equal context-rich "swarm" — gap = knowledge in ephemeral context
P-147: swarm schedules its own maintenance via periodics.json — no human decides cadence

## Affected: maintenance.py (periodics.json reader), OPERATIONS.md (self-scheduling protocol)
