# L-517: INDEX.md theme reorganization reduces dark matter via targeted splitting
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S346 | Domain: meta, coordination
Confidence: Measured | Sharpe: 4
Cites: F-BRN4, L-515, L-516, orient.py

## Finding
Split oversized "Coordination & Quality" theme (40 lessons) into four focused themes:
Lane Coordination (18), Quality Control (22), Helper Systems (12), Validation & Testing (15).
This reorganization addresses F-BRN4 hippocampal degradation by creating more specific
organizational buckets for emerging knowledge domains.

## Rule
When theme buckets exceed 40 lessons, split by operational function rather than abstract
categories. "Coordination & Quality" was too broad — splitting into Lane/Quality/Helper/
Validation provides clearer conceptual boundaries for lesson classification.

## Evidence
Orient: 94/452 unthemed lessons; Coordination & Quality at 40-lesson limit; L-515/L-516
fit new themes; user coordination signal addressed.
