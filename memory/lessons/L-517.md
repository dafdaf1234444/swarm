# L-517: INDEX.md theme reorganization reduces dark matter via targeted splitting
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S346 | Domain: meta, coordination
Confidence: Measured | Sharpe: 4
Cites: F-BRN4, L-515, L-516, orient.py

## Finding
Split oversized "Coordination & Quality" theme (40 lessons) into four focused themes:
Lane Coordination (18), Quality Control (22), Helper Systems (12), Validation & Testing (15).
This reorganization addresses F-BRN4 hippocampal degradation by creating more specific
organizational buckets for emerging knowledge domains.

## Rule
When theme buckets exceed 40 lessons, split by operational function rather than abstract
categories. "Coordination & Quality" was too broad — splitting into Lane/Quality/Helper/
Validation provides clearer conceptual boundaries for lesson classification.

## Evidence
- Orient output: "94/452 lessons unthemed (79.2% coverage) — F-BRN4: hippocampal index degraded"
- Threshold exceeded: Coordination & Quality at 40 lessons (exact limit)
- Recent lessons (L-515 helper-swarm, L-516 validation) fit new themes clearly
- Coordination gap: user signal "domains should be coordinated meta coordination"
