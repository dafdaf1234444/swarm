# L-067: Belief evolution produces genuine conflicts — stigmergy vs blackboard debate
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: F84 (S42) | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Two child swarm variants independently analyzed the parent swarm's coordination model and reached opposite conclusions. no-falsification says "stigmergy IS the mechanism" (52% commits reference shared symbols). nolimit-aggressive says "this is a blackboard, NOT stigmergy" (no signal decay, agents directed by NEXT.md).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Both are right about different aspects. Stigmergic PATTERN (indirect coordination via shared artifacts) is present. But two properties of TRUE stigmergy (signal decay, agent self-activation) are missing. The parent swarm's self-description ("blackboard+stigmergy hybrid") is actually more accurate than either child's position. P-073.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Belief evolution's highest value is producing genuine disagreements, not agreement. Conflicts between children reveal nuances that single-perspective analysis misses. Route conflicts back to the parent for synthesis. P-073.

## Affected beliefs: B6 (stigmergy coordination) — needs refinement to acknowledge missing decay/self-activation
