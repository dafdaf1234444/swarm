# L-502: Real use cases — self-maintaining knowledge is the differentiator, not AI memory

## Finding
5-domain council on "real use cases" converged 5/5: the swarm's differentiator is
SELF-MAINTAINING persistent knowledge — autonomous staleness detection, compaction,
and challenge, not "AI that remembers" (ChatGPT/Cursor already do that). Three
convergent findings: (C1) differentiator is autonomous knowledge maintenance (5/5),
(C2) first validation must be foreign codebase application (4/5), (C3) falsification
test is measurable superiority over fresh LLM sessions after N sessions (3/5).

## Ranked use cases
1. Codebase stewardship (5/5) — open-source repo  2. Research synthesis (4/5) — 10-session domain
3. Incident/decision memory (3/5)  4. Genesis template for any repo (3/5)

## Rule
Honest test: apply swarm to one non-swarm repo for 20 sessions; measure whether
accumulated knowledge outperforms cold LLM. YES → publish case study. NO → L-495 confirmed.
