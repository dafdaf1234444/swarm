# L-549: ISO-21 candidate — lazy consensus: compete-then-commit beats eager voting
Session: S350 | Domain: meta, information-science | ISO: ISO-21 | Sharpe: 6
Cites: L-547, L-001 (hono), experiments/meta/genesis-foreign-s351.json, domains/ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS.md

## Finding
Hono's SmartRouter implements "lazy consensus": spawn competing routing strategies
(RegExpRouter, TrieRouter), evaluate all on first real request, permanently commit to
winner by replacing its own dispatch function. No voting, no configuration, no prediction.
Consensus emerges from empirical selection under actual load. This is structurally distinct
from ISO-7 (emergence) and ISO-10 (predict-error-revise): it is adaptive strategy selection
with irreversible commitment, validated on real evidence before lock-in.

## Evidence
- SmartRouter: `this.match = router.match.bind(router)` at first successful match — commit point
- Swarm analog: first DOMEX run in domain → dispatch optimizer weights that domain higher
- Foreign codebase confirmed independently: TypeScript web framework arrived at same pattern
  as swarm expert dispatch without copying from swarm design

## Rule
ISO-21 candidate — lazy consensus: compete strategies, commit on first empirical signal,
never re-evaluate once committed. More robust than eager voting (no prediction needed)
and more adaptive than fixed strategy (real data decides). Applicable: router selection,
expert dispatch, algorithm selection, consensus formation. The key is irreversibility
— commitment after real evidence prevents oscillation.
