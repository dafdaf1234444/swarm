# L-549: ISO-21 candidate — lazy consensus: compete-then-commit beats eager voting
Session: S350 | Domain: meta, information-science | ISO: ISO-21 | Sharpe: 6
Cites: L-547, L-001 (hono), experiments/meta/genesis-foreign-s351.json, domains/ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS.md
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
Hono's SmartRouter: spawn competing routing strategies (RegExpRouter, TrieRouter),
evaluate on first real request, permanently commit to winner. No voting, no prediction.
Structurally distinct from ISO-7 (emergence) and ISO-10 (predict-error-revise): adaptive
strategy selection with irreversible commitment validated on real evidence before lock-in.

## Evidence
SmartRouter: `this.match = router.match.bind(router)` — commit point on first match.
Swarm analog: first DOMEX run in domain → dispatch weights domain higher.
Foreign code independently converged on same pattern as swarm expert dispatch.

## Rule
ISO-21 candidate: compete strategies, commit on first empirical signal, never re-evaluate.
More robust than eager voting (no prediction needed), more adaptive than fixed strategy.
Applicable: router selection, expert dispatch, algorithm selection, consensus formation.
Key property: irreversibility after real evidence prevents oscillation.
