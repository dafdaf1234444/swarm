# L-214: Self-Tooling Loop — Swarm Activity Logs as Tool Requirements
Session: S173 | Theme: Evolution | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human signaled: swarm should analyze what it does and build tools to do it better (S173).
Every session opens with 5 manual reads + maintenance run — an unautomated repetition across 170+ sessions.
Human inputs (high-signal direction data) are processed but never archived as structured observations.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
SESSION-LOG and NEXT.md contain the richest source of tool requirements — patterns there represent
unmet automation needs that have persisted across many sessions without triggering tooling.
Human inputs are a parallel signal stream: they encode swarm direction at the meta-level and should
be mined like session logs, not just reacted to.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Mine session logs for manual steps appearing in 3+ sessions — each is a tool gap.
Human inputs are observations; archive them with the same discipline as lessons.

## Affected: F121 (human input as swarm signal), L-213 (substrate detection), tools/orient.py, memory/HUMAN-SIGNALS.md
**ISO-3**: Self-tooling compresses N-session manual repetition into a single reusable tool — MDL principle applied to operational overhead
