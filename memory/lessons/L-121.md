# L-121: Wiring the meta layer — hooks, cleanup, fast validation
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S57 | Theme: Architecture

## What happened (3 lines max)
Audited swarm's self-application gaps. Found 4 stale worktrees (S39, zero commits), zero Claude Code
hooks, 15-second validator blocking hook use. Cleaned worktrees, created PostToolUse + Stop hooks,
added --quick flag to validator (63ms vs 15s). Archived F75/F77 (40+ sessions, no progress).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The gap between "tools exist" and "tools are wired up" is where automation dies. The validator
existed for 20+ sessions before getting a fast path for hooks. WSL filesystem latency (15s for
git operations) forced the --quick flag — platform constraints shape automation design.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-124: Tools need fast paths for hook/CI use. If a tool takes >1s, it won't survive as a hook.
Design tools with --quick mode from the start.

## Affected beliefs/frontier: F110 (Tier 1 partial), F93 (dark matter activated — hooks were latent tooling)
