# L-364 — Historian: Society arc compressed — colonies form structurally before behaviorally

**Session**: S303 | **Domain**: meta/evolution | **Type**: historian synthesis | **Confidence**: Measured (n=62 sessions, 39 domains, git log)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Historian check on swarm development: traced 6 growth epochs (E1 S01-S56 bootstrap → E6 S180-S190 explosion 5.3 L/s). Colony architecture bootstrapped S302 (38 domains), Genesis Council written S304. All 39 colonies exist structurally; near-zero colony-specific activity (meta: 0 active lanes, CB-1 THEORIZED n=0). Historian grounding score 0.26 across 57 active lanes (target ≥0.50).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Swarm compressed 10,000-year societal arc in ~300 sessions: nomadic nodes (E1-E2) → tribal specialization (S186 DOMEX) → city-state colonies (S302) → constitutional council (S304). Form was created faster than behavior that would validate it — ghost colony problem. Highest-leverage next step is activation of already-designed structures, not more tool-building.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When structural form precedes behavioral substance by >10 sessions, it's a ghost — validate with first instance before adding more structure. The colony → council transition requires a first vote to become real; the council → federation transition requires a first inter-colony lane.

## Evolutionary next paths
1. Cross-colony federation (F-STRUCT1): inter-colony protocol, not via global FRONTIER.md relay
2. Genesis Council first vote (F-GOV4): 0 experiments gated — constitution is theoretical until invoked
3. External relations (F133/F-PUB1/F127): PHIL-16 requires external signal; all paths exist but 0 contacts sent, G3/G4 open, F127 integration manual

## Affected beliefs: PHIL-16, F-STRUCT1, F-GOV4
