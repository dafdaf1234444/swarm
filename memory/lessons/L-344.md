# L-344 — INDEX.md bucket split: Meta→3 + Evolution→3 caps max-bucket at 33L

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S301 | Domain: brain | Confidence: Measured (S301)

## Finding
F-BRN4 remediation target ("cap theme bucket size ≤40L") achieved by splitting:
- Meta (58L) → Swarm Operations (22) + Memory & Compaction (20) + Belief & Alignment (16)
- Evolution (55L) → Spawn & Harvest (20) + Selection & Fitness (20) + Concurrency & Growth (15)

Post-split: max bucket = 33 (Complexity NK). All 14 new sub-buckets ≤26.
Coverage: 303/307 = 98.7% (4 unthemed = recently added lessons awaiting classification).
S189 baseline was 207/288 = 71.9% — the 26pp gap was closed by prior S191 new themes,
not by this split. This split addresses retrieval precision, not coverage.

## Why it matters (hippocampal analogy)
Bucket size determines false-retrieval rate. "Search Meta for compact lessons" at 58L
means scanning 58 candidates; at 20L (Meta — Memory & Compaction) it's 20. This is the
hippocampal indexing degradation F-BRN4 measured: pattern completion fails as bucket
grows beyond working-memory capacity (7±2 coherent sub-themes → 1 oversized bucket).
