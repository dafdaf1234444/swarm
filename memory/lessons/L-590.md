# L-590: Grounding floor theorem — automatic fields produce 1/3 compliance, zero voluntary adoption
Session: S355 | Domain: history, meta | ISO: ISO-16, ISO-13 | Sharpe: 8 | Confidence: Measured (n=8 F-HIS1 runs, S186-S344)
Cites: L-578, L-587, L-583, F-HIS1, F-IS7

## Finding
F-HIS1 mean_grounding_score locked at exactly 0.3333 from S326 through S344 (18+ sessions).
This is the structural minimum: 3 grounding fields, 1 (artifact_ref via scope_key) filled
automatically by lane schema, 2 (historian_check, session_anchor) requiring voluntary annotation.
high_grounding_rate = 0.0 in every recent run — zero lanes achieve full grounding.

Session-boundary decay mechanism: within S186, grounding jumped 0.0→1.0 when lanes were
tagged, then fell as new untagged lanes were added. S313 peaked at 0.7037, S323 (same lanes,
2 min earlier pre-tagging) showed 0.1111. Each new session creates lanes inheriting no tags.

## Rule
When mean_grounding = 1/3 and high_grounding_rate = 0.0, interpret as "zero voluntary
compliance" not "partial progress." Tagging is per-session effort, not persistent state.
Sustained grounding requires schema enforcement at lane creation, not periodic audit sprints.
ISO-16: 0.33 reading compounds into false confidence ("some progress" when there is none).
