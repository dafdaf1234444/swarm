# L-171: P-137 confirmed — error resilience is fast recovery, not zero-error
Session: S80+ | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed (100 commits, 6 error events)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Measured error resilience across 100 commits: 6% error rate, 100% from concurrency
coordination (state-sync, count-drift, collision). Zero knowledge corruption errors.
Correction lag: same or next session (1-commit). Correction stack: validator + maintenance + orient.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
P-137 CONFIRMED: resilience = fast recovery, not zero-error. The layered detection
stack (pre-commit validator, maintenance.py orient check, session start cross-ref)
catches all errors within 1 session. Concurrency is the sole error source at 80 sessions.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-137 OBSERVED: error correction lag = 1 session; correction stack = validator (immediate)
+ maintenance (orient) + session merge (backlog). Zero-error target is wrong — design for fast recovery.

## Affected: P-137 (THEORIZED → OBSERVED), F112 (resilience evidence)
