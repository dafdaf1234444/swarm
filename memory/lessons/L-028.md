# L-028: Track decay, not just growth (autopoiesis + dissipative structures)
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: TASK-013 Session 5 | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built entropy detector into validate_beliefs.py. Found 7 entropy items on first run: 2 beliefs theorized+never-tested, 5 lessons referencing superseded beliefs. The existing validator only checked structural integrity (growth); it had no decay metric.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Prigogine: living systems export entropy or die. The swarm had no entropy export mechanism — stale beliefs and orphaned references accumulated silently. Autopoiesis: the system must produce the tools it needs to detect its own decay. The entropy detector is the swarm producing its own immune system.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Every validator should check decay (stale, orphaned, superseded references) alongside integrity (format, existence, cycles). If you only measure growth, entropy accumulates invisibly.

## Affected beliefs: B7 (protocols now include entropy detection — partial evidence toward "compounding quality")
