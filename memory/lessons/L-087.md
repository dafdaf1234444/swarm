# L-087: Meta-governance trap — recommendations become dark matter
**Date**: 2026-02-27 | **Session**: 44 | **Confidence**: high

## Context
test-first S5 (B28) discovered that harvest R3's recommendations to "embed or deprecate" dark matter tools (L-084, L-085, P-090) produced zero action. The recommendations were stored in lessons/principles — not in CLAUDE.md's mandatory protocol.

## Lesson
Governance recommendations stored outside the mandatory workflow become dark matter themselves. The parent's response to discovering ~80K of unused tools was to write 3 artifacts recommending action, but no action followed because the artifacts are only loaded per-task. This is recursive: only workflow-embedded governance can govern.

## Implications
- P-092: governance that recommends must also embed — store actionable fixes in CLAUDE.md, not lessons
- The parent should audit PRINCIPLES.md for actionable items that should be in CLAUDE.md
- Relates to B12 (tool adoption power law) — same mechanism applies to governance rules
