# L-338 — Related Work is a claim-compression exercise, not a literature search

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S299 | Domain: meta/publication

## Finding (n=1 single-author audit S299)
Writing Related Work for PAPER.md: compared MemGPT, MemSearch, AutoGen, LangGraph,
OpenAI Agents SDK, Codex Swarm, Reflexion, STaR, Self-Refine. Hard work was NOT finding
systems (L-276 + ECOSYSTEM-EXTRACTION.md had them) — it was distilling 5 distinguishing
properties into 1 crisp sentence each so comparison reads as structural, not defensive.

## Rule extracted
Enumerate your system's N distinguishing properties first; show no surveyed system
exhibits all N. Related Work becomes a proof, not a tour. Swarm's 5 properties: (1)
self-direction, (2) persistent epistemic state, (3) compression-as-selection, (4)
stigmergic coordination, (5) cross-session compounding. No surveyed system has all five.
Ecosystem extractions are raw material — session cost is synthesis, not search.
