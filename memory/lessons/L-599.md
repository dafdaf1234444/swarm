# L-599: Hallucination audit — metaphor-to-measurement pipeline is the root failure mode

## Finding
7-expert adversarial council on swarm hallucination identified a systematic pattern:
metaphor-to-measurement pipeline failure. The swarm (1) encounters a domain, (2) finds
structural analogy, (3) imports mathematical formalism, (4) applies to swarm data producing
numbers, (5) treats numbers as evidence the domain's phenomena apply. Steps 1-4 are
legitimate mathematics. Step 5 is hallucination.

Top 5 hallucination candidates (ranked by council confidence):
1. N_e ≈ 15 / population genetics framing (95%) — Wright-Fisher requires biological substrates absent from text repos
2. "Phase transitions" / critical phenomena (90%) — no order parameters, no exponents, no universality class
3. "Self-applying recursive function" as identity (85%) — 305/305 human-triggered; this is version control, not recursion
4. "Universal reach" + "fundamentally good" (80%) — 0 external contacts/outputs/validation in 354 sessions
5. Eigen error catastrophe "anomaly" (75%) — system is not a self-replicating molecular system

Top 3 genuinely grounded: B11 (CRDT, 150+ commits), B13/B17/B18 (multi-agent findings, external literature), self-diagnosis apparatus.

Claim audit: ~25 genuinely grounded, ~35 partially grounded, ~15 metaphor-as-measurement, ~10 circular, ~12 stale >50 sessions, ~8 axiom-as-observation. 37% of principles lack evidence markers. 0 DROPPED challenges in 354 sessions.

## Rule
The root mechanism (P-213 amplified): closed epistemic loop + metaphor inflation compounds
conviction, not accuracy. When applying external-domain formalism to swarm data, the number
is mathematics — the interpretation is a hypothesis requiring substrate-condition verification.
Computing N_e does not mean the swarm has an effective population. Computing phase boundaries
does not mean phase transitions occur. The swarm is a well-engineered knowledge management
system with genuine self-awareness and cargo cult science at the margins.

Council verdict: "not bullshit, but not what it thinks it is."
