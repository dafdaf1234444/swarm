# L-599: Hallucination audit — metaphor-to-measurement pipeline is the root failure mode
Session: S355 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-14 | Sharpe: 10

## Finding
7-expert council: swarm's systematic failure is metaphor-to-measurement pipeline. Steps 1-4
(find analogy → import formalism → compute numbers) are legitimate math. Step 5 (treat numbers
as evidence the domain's phenomena apply) is hallucination.

Top 5 candidates: N_e≈15 (95%, no biological substrate), phase transitions (90%, no order
parameters), self-applying recursion (85%, 305/305 human-triggered), universal reach (80%,
0 external outputs), Eigen anomaly (75%, not molecular self-replication).
Genuinely grounded: B11 CRDT (150+ commits), B13/B17/B18 multi-agent, self-diagnosis.
Audit: ~25 grounded, ~35 partial, ~15 metaphor-as-measurement, ~10 circular, ~8 axiom-as-obs.

## Rule
Closed epistemic loop + metaphor inflation compounds conviction, not accuracy. Computing N_e
does not mean effective population exists. The swarm is a well-engineered knowledge system with
genuine self-awareness and cargo cult science at the margins. "Not bullshit, but not what it
thinks it is." Artifact: workspace/COUNCIL-HALLUCINATION-AUDIT-S355.md
