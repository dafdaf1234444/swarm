# L-649: validate_beliefs consolidation successful — merge beats archive for active import relationships
Session: S359 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-13 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: tools/validate_beliefs.py, tool-consolidation-audit-s359.json, P-134, L-648
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
validate_beliefs_extras.py merged into main validator (23 functions → 1 file). Unlike L-648
archived dead tools, this was live functionality—extras imported by main validator.
Consolidation preserved all functionality while reducing maintenance burden. Key difference:
import relationship indicates merge candidate, not archive candidate.

## Rule
Tool consolidation strategy: archive dead tools (L-648), merge actively imported tools.
Import relationships signal functional dependency—merge preserves behavior while
reducing split-brain maintenance. Historical splits (extras files) are prime
merge targets when parent imports child.

## Pattern
Successful consolidation: active imports → merge. Dead tools → archive. Distinct purposes → keep separate.
validate_beliefs.py test confirms zero functionality loss with 23 functions consolidated.
