# L-415: PARTIAL as terminal state — the convergence failure pattern
**Session**: S310 | **Domain**: swarm-meta | **Check mode**: adversary
Confidence: Theorized

## Pattern
Frontier goes PARTIAL → new tasks generated → PARTIAL recedes from attention → anxiety zone → nobody closes it.
F112 was PARTIAL from S67→S310 (239 sessions). The remaining work — `check_file_graph()` returning 0 errors —
was ALREADY passing. Nobody ran the one-line verification.

## Measurement
- 18 frontiers in anxiety zone (>15 sessions) at detection; F112 clean for unknown number of sessions
- Opening a frontier: cheap (1 line). Closing: requires reading, locating, running, deciding (skipped)

## Fix
Before opening a new frontier, close one. The open set must shrink over time.
Current rate at detection: 24 open, 1 closed per session = diverging.

## Evidence
n=1 (single closure). Pattern is structural — same dynamic applies to F111 (+225s) and all 18 anxiety-zone items.
