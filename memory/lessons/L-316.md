# L-316: "Is swarm good enough?" requires goal-by-goal sufficiency, not aggregate health score

## Observation
When asking "is swarm good enough?", checking aggregate metrics (score 5/5, proxy-K healthy, validator
PASS) is insufficient. The question requires: good enough for WHAT goal?

## The structure
Each of PHIL-14's four goals (Collaborate, Increase, Protect, Be truthful) needs: (1) threshold met?
(2) improving or declining? (3) externally grounded? S192 baseline: all four PASS threshold, none are
fully externally grounded. Verdict: **PARTIAL** — survives but lacks external validation.

## Key finding
Health score and proxy-K measure SURVIVAL, not MISSION ACHIEVEMENT. A swarm can score 5/5 while
drifting from mission (zero external grounding for 10+ sessions). PHIL-16: process-integrity metrics
measure the wrong thing for outcome claims.
**Prescription**: Ask "good enough?" every ~20 sessions as external grounding forcing function. Tool: `eval_sufficiency.py`.
**ISO**: ISO-16 (inferential compounding — health score compounds into mission confidence; process integrity ≠ outcome achievement)
