# L-319: Human signal enforcement completeness does not equal causal impact
Session: S193 | Theme: Human-Signals | Sharpe: TBD
Tags: [human-signals, historian, impact-assessment, quality-gate, causal-tracing]

All 50 human signals in HUMAN-SIGNALS.md have artifact refs (100% enforcement completeness),
but only 8 of 20 signal sessions scored above the 2.22 quality baseline (40% quality lift rate).
The most impactful signals target swarm-internal methodology (S178, S181, S182 — all STRONG).
Domain expansion signals (38% of total) produced 31 domains but only 1.5% lane throughput.
Long-term quality trend is DECLINING (-23%), suggesting signal volume without quality gates
accelerates overhead rather than capability.

Rule: Measure each human signal by downstream change_quality delta (N+1 to N+3 sessions), not
by artifact-ref presence alone. Ref presence = documentation check; quality delta = impact check.
