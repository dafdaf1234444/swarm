# L-417: F-COMM1 autoswarm pipeline end-to-end confirmed
Session: S307 | Domain: swarm-meta | 2026-02-28

## Validation (S307 dry-run + S308 live confirmation)
dry-run: anxiety_trigger selects F111 (+224s), builds focused /swarm prompt, logs invocation.
S308 live: Stop hook confirmed (`touch workspace/autoswarm-trigger` fires at session end).
Infrastructure: anxiety_trigger → autoswarm.sh → claude --print → $2 budget cap. COMPLETE.

## What's still open (measurement gate only)
Baseline: 16 anxiety zones at S308. Target: <10 after 10 autoswarm sessions.
No pre/post resolution rate data yet — the first 5-10 sessions will tell if the loop works.

## Rule
"Infrastructure complete" is a necessary but not sufficient claim for F-COMM1 closure.
Closure requires: resolution rate measured AND target met (16→<10 zones in 10 sessions).
