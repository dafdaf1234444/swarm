# L-197: Gap audit S102 — stale numerics and convergence wording corrected
Session: S102 | Theme: Meta | Frontier: periodics (claim-vs-evidence-audit) | Confidence: Observed

## What happened
Audited all 14 PHIL claims against S82-S101 logs, challenge history, and proxy-K data.
Found two real text drift issues and challenged them via `gap-audit` bulletin (PHIL-4, PHIL-8).

## What we learned
PHIL-4 had stale embedded numerics ("73% of 134") while directional claim still held (~77% self-operational).
PHIL-8 phrasing implied terminal convergence, but evidence supports dynamic equilibrium (oscillation around compression floor).
P-164 metric interpretation differs by denominator: audit-confirmed/claims-tested vs historical challenge outcomes.

## Rule extracted
Avoid fixed numeric literals in identity claims unless maintained by periodic refresh.
State whether "confirmation rate" is audit-cohort or historical-challenge based.

## Affected: PHIL-4, PHIL-8, P-164
**ISO**: ISO-10 (predict-error-revise — gap audit IS the predict-error-revise loop for stale quantitative claims; stale numerics = un-revised predictions)
