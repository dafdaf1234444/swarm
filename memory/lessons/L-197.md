# L-197: Gap audit S102 — 12/14 confirmed, 2 challenged, P-164 signal triggered
Session: S102 | Theme: Meta | Frontier: periodics (claim-vs-evidence-audit) | Confidence: Observed (full state audit S82-S101)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Tested all 14 PHIL claims against git history, session log (S82-S101), proxy K data,
and challenge records. 2 genuine contradictions found and challenged via bulletin.py.
P-164 gap-audit confirmation rate = 14/14 = 100% — signal triggered.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
PHIL-4 contains a stale embedded count ("73% of 134 lessons"): now 194 lessons, 77%
self-operational — directional claim confirmed, specific numbers factually wrong.
PHIL-8 "finds its minimal form" implies convergence; proxy K shows dynamic equilibrium
(±2-6% oscillation around floor 23,383), not convergence — L-168 already named this,
but PHILOSOPHY.md text still implies convergence. Challenge filed for both.
Note: L-195 misread P-164 (used challenge-outcome rate 43% instead of audit-confirmation
rate 100%) — P-164 signal WAS triggered; L-195 interpretation was incorrect.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Embedded quantitative claims in identity documents become stale — audit numbers at each
gap cycle, not just direction. P-164 "confirmation rate" = (confirmed at audit)/(tested),
not (challenges that held)/(all historical challenges). These metrics are distinct.

## Affected: PHIL-4 (stale count challenged), PHIL-8 (convergence vs equilibrium challenged), P-164 (interpretation clarified)
