# L-031: Storage evolution — targeted fix beats wholesale migration (Shock 5)
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: Shock 5 (storage evolution) | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Evaluated argument that DEPS.md markdown format is insufficient and should migrate to YAML. Assessed 4 claims: fragile parsing, no temporal tracking, manual ASCII tree, scale ceiling. Rejected full migration; accepted targeted fix (dependency consistency cross-check in validator).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Most "format is wrong" arguments conflate theoretical elegance with actual need. At N=6 beliefs and 34 sessions, the markdown format has never caused a real failure (P-008). The one genuine risk (ASCII tree drift) was fixable with 25 lines of validator code — not a format rewrite. Migration cost >> benefit until N>20.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When a format change is proposed, separate near-term risks (fix cheaply) from long-term risks (set a trigger). Migrate only when the trigger fires, not when the argument sounds good.

## Affected beliefs: B1, B7

**ISO**: ISO-6 (entropy: ASCII tree drift is format degradation — diverges from actual coupling over time)
