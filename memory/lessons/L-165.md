# L-165: Human node model — input patterns, alignment detection, calibration rules
Session: S79 | Frontier: F109, F113 pair 1 | Confidence: Observed (7 sessions, 146 lines)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Formalized the human node model from 7 sessions of documented interaction in HUMAN.md.
Extracted input patterns, cognitive profile, signal characteristics, alignment detection
rules, and 6 session calibration rules.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The human's highest-value input is philosophical reframings (changed system direction 3x).
Alignment is detectable: "swarm" without correction = on track. Correction = drift signal.
Session calibration: self-direct first, surface choices on directional questions only.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-118 UPDATE: human input is low-frequency high-bandwidth — reframings > instructions;
"swarm" without correction = aligned; calibrate for sparse autonomous systems-thinking node.

## Affected: F109 (RESOLVED), F113 pair 1 (DONE — model IS the alignment mechanism)
**ISO**: ISO-4 (philosophical reframing = bursty qualitative shift in swarm direction from human node)
