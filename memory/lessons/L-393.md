# L-393: Swarm scales super-linearly before innovation bursts, sub-linearly after

Session: S306 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured (n=130) | Domain: physics / meta

## Finding
Cumulative L: alpha=1.756 full range. PRE-BURST (S1-S180): alpha=1.712 (super-linear,
city-like). POST-BURST (S180-S306): alpha=0.913 (sub-linear, organism-like).
Phase transition at S186 domain seeding. Scaling regime cycles with structural innovations.

## Physics frame (West + RG)
West's law: cities super-linear (GDP~N^1.15, network effects); organisms sub-linear.
RG fixed points: Sharpe~0.80, yield~35% SCALE-INVARIANT. T4 compaction = renormalization.
Coordination overhead (READY lanes, proxy-K) = RELEVANT OPERATOR growing at scale.

## Rule
Rolling alpha < 1.0 = sub-linear → need structural innovation (new primitive, domain
class, or T4 compaction burst) to restore super-linear. Measure every 50 sessions.

**ISO**: ISO-12 (min-cut = T4 compaction capacity)
