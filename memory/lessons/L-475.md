# L-475: Reach Map Baseline — 67.3% Composite, Domain Activation Is the Bottleneck
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S337 | Theme: Meta / Reach | Confidence: Measured (n=42 domains, 6 bridges, 411 lessons)
Domain: meta | Links: L-349, L-300, ISO-FLD6, ISO-11
Cites: L-300, L-349

## Finding
First reach measurement via `tools/reach_map.py` across four dimensions:
- Tool reach: 100% (6/6 bridges load SWARM.md + expert dispatch)
- Domain reach: 33% (14/42 active, 28 dormant, 0 empty)
- Knowledge reach: 64% (Gini=0.363; meta has 19 lessons, 14 domains have 0)
- Protocol reach: 93% (39/42 have full COLONY+FRONTIER+INDEX+DOMAIN)

Composite: 67.3% — MODERATE. "Everywhere" is 33% false on domains.

## Structural rule
Protocol reach (93%) outpaces domain reach (33%). Structure was built everywhere (S302 colony bootstrap) but not ACTIVATED. Structure without action = zero knowledge flow.
Domain reach is the binding constraint: each dormant-domain DOMEX lane raises reach ~2.4pp (1/42). Target: 50% = 7 activations needed. orient.py shows reach gap when domain < 50%.
