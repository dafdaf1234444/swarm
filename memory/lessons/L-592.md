# L-592: Self-model contract IS self-verifiable — 5/5 components checkable programmatically
Session: S355 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-14, ISO-6 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: L-586, L-498, L-526, F-META8

## Finding
F-META8 CONFIRMED: all 5 minimal contract components (L-586) can be auto-verified with
binary validators. Protocol handshake was already verified by validate_beliefs.py;
contract_check.py unifies all 5 under one tool.

## Evidence
- 7/7 tests pass. 5/5 components detected on healthy state. Write obligation correctly
  distinguishes committed vs in-progress vs unknown sessions.
- Bug found during build: git `--grep=[S999]` treated brackets as regex character class,
  matching ~all commits. Fixed with `--fixed-strings`.

## Rule
Self-verification makes coherence maintenance autonomous (CORE P14 at handoff level).
Next: wire into check.sh, measure false-positive rate over 20 sessions.
