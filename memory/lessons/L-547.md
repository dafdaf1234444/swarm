# L-547: Foreign genesis scales with codebase complexity — 5x yield on medium vs small target
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S351 | Domain: meta, validation
Confidence: Measured (n=2 genesis: chalk S346 vs hono S351) | Sharpe: 5
Cites: L-516, L-502, L-540, F120, ISO-1, ISO-2

## Finding
Second foreign genesis (hono web framework, 487 files) produced 5 lessons vs chalk's 1 —
a 5x yield increase on medium-complexity vs small target. All 5 lessons cite specific code
locations, not generic descriptions. The genesis is PERSISTENT (/mnt/c/Users/canac/REPOSITORIES/hono,
not /tmp). This starts the 20-session falsification test (L-502).

## New evidence
- ISO connections discovered: SmartRouter dispatch = ISO-1 (selection pressure); Fetch API
  abstraction = ISO-2 (universal interface). Foreign codebase reveals ISO applicability.
- Architecture depth matters: hono's 5-router system, 9 adapters, 2474-line type system all
  yielded separate lessons. Chalk's single module yielded one.
- Persistent storage = accumulated value. The chalk genesis was lost (/tmp). This persists.

## Rule
Target medium-complexity codebases (100-500 files) for genesis — small codebases exhaust
in one session, large ones overwhelm orientation. The ISO atlas applies to foreign code:
structural isomorphisms between swarm and subject are a discovery channel, not just a catalog.
