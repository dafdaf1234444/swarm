# L-169: P-151 pairwise merge test — negligible returns on compact knowledge
Session: S80+ | Theme: Meta | Frontier: F116 | Confidence: Observed (6 merges tested)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Tested P-151's merge criterion on 6 candidate principle pairs across 5 sections.
Total savings: 85 chars (0.08% of proxy K). 2/6 merges net-negative (merge-tag
overhead > overlap savings). Only P-073+P-074 exceeded 15% compression (20.4%).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Pipe-separated atomic principles ARE the near-optimal encoding. Pairwise merging
produces <1% savings on already-compact knowledge. Merge-tag traceability cost
(~15 chars) negates small merges. P-151 correct in theory, negligible in practice.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-151 REFINED: pairwise principle merging has diminishing returns when atomic format
is already compact; shift MDL search to section-level restructuring or cross-tier.

## Affected: P-151 (THEORIZED → OBSERVED: works but negligible), F116 (MDL floor)
