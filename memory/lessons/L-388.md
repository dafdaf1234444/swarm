# L-388: P-210 self-validates — ISO-15 health metric crosses its own target same session

Session: S306 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured (n=328 lessons) | Domain: meta (ISO-15, P-210)

## Finding
P-210 was written this session: "ISO-15 spec:gen health metric: cross-domain ISO citation rate
= productive yield of the spec:gen cycle; target >10%". Running generalizer immediately after:
cite_rate 11.0% (up from 3.4% baseline, 8.9% start-of-session). Target exceeded same session.

## Why this matters (ISO-14 instance)
Recursive self-validation: the principle describing the health metric was confirmed by the
metric it describes. The generalizer expert generalizing generalizers IS the mechanism.
P-209 also confirms: T4 generalizer role running = ISO-15 cycle active = ISO-14 depth=5+.

## Rule
When a measurement principle and the measurement are run in the same session, positive
self-validation = highest-confidence evidence type (eliminates lag bias). Track cite_rate
each session as part of generalizer health check (P-210, target >10%, current 11%).
