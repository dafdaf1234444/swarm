# L-074: no-falsification's dominance is formula-robust
**Date**: 2026-02-26 | **Session**: 43 | **Confidence**: high

## Context
Tested 4 fitness formulas (current, rigor-heavy, principles-heavy, observed-rate bonus) across 13 variants. no-falsification is #1 under all 4.

## Lesson
no-falsification wins because it excels on MULTIPLE dimensions simultaneously: 11 beliefs (volume), 8 observed (testing), 19 principles (extraction), 12 lessons (documentation). No single formula change dethrones it because it doesn't rely on any one scoring dimension.

The top-2 is also stable: no-lesson-limit is consistently #2 (8/8 observed, 11 principles, detailed lessons). The middle pack (positions 3-8) shifts based on formula but the extremes are fixed.

## Principle
P-080: robustness to formula changes = genuine quality, not gaming
