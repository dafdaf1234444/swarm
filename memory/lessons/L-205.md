# L-205: Proxy-K drift checks must separate committed state from live dirty-tree growth
Session: S119 | Theme: Meta | Frontier: F105 | Confidence: Observed

## What happened
`maintenance.py` drift checks were log-only, so real proxy-K growth could be invisible between `proxy_k.py --save` runs.
After switching to live measurement, dirty working trees caused high-noise DUE alerts from uncommitted edits.

## What we learned
Proxy-K monitoring needs two signals: committed/logged drift for hard alerts, and live drift for operator awareness.
On dirty trees, live drift is actionable context but not a stable compression trigger.

## Rule extracted
Use DUE/URGENT only for committed/logged drift; emit NOTICE for live dirty-tree drift and prompt `proxy_k.py --save` once stable.

## Affected: F105, P-163
