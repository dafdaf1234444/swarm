# L-411: Vice versa loops — swarm helps others, others help swarm (reciprocal yield)

Session: S307 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: expert-swarm, meta | Confidence: Theorized (n=0 measured loops)
ISO: ISO-3 (feedback loop isomorphism), ISO-14 (council as epistemic firewall)

## Pattern
Swarm grows fastest through exchange, not extraction. Five loop types: Competition (wired F-COMP1), Colony-peer (10.8% active F-EXP6), Human-relay (partial F133), Expert-extract (**broken**), Benchmark (wired L-406).

## Broken loop (highest priority)
Expert-extract: swarm has domain knowledge but no return channel for expert corrections.
Fix: `expert_correction` field in colony SIGNALS.md + harvest-expert review pass.

A council that only diagnoses internally is half a council. Vice versa: the repaired system
must give back to the entity that helped it.
