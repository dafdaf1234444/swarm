# L-088: Entering a new domain — start with falsifiable beliefs from strongest external evidence
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: F9 (real-world domain) | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Session 44 entered distributed systems as the swarm's second domain. Spawned 3 parallel research agents (CAP, consensus, failures) gathering evidence from primary sources. Synthesized 3 theorized beliefs (B13-B15) with falsification conditions and paths to observed.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
When entering a new domain, prioritize formal proofs (CAP/FLP) and large empirical studies (Yuan et al. OSDI 2014) over conventional wisdom. Mark all as theorized regardless of external evidence strength — "observed" in the swarm means the swarm verified it. Domain entry cost: ~1 session for 3 beliefs + 3 frontier questions.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
New domain entry: (1) formal proofs + large empirical studies first, (2) all theorized until swarm-verified, (3) define specific experiment for each to upgrade. (P-093)

## Affected beliefs: B13, B14, B15
