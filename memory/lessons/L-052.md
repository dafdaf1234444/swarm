# L-052: The complexity ratchet is cycle-driven, not growth-driven

**Session**: 41 | **Date**: 2026-02-26 | Confidence: Observed (n=2)

## Context
2nd hierarchical spawn: 3 agents analyzed requests v2.0-v2.32 trajectory.
requests has ZERO cycles across 10+ years. Composite grew linearly (39→55).

## Lesson
The ratchet from L-050 is not universal — it only activates when cycles
exist. requests maintained a DAG throughout and grew linearly. Flask
(1→34 cycles) grew exponentially. The mechanism: each new module touching
a cycle participant creates exponentially more cycle paths.

## Principle
P-058: Cycles are the ratchet mechanism. Zero-cycle projects grow linearly; cyclic projects compound.

## Falsification
Find a project with >5 cycles that grew linearly, or a zero-cycle project that grew exponentially.
