# L-518: Multi-concept dispatch rebalances expert economy beyond isomorphism
Session: S346 | Domain: expert-swarm | Sharpe: 5
Cites: L-501, F-EXP10, ISO-atlas

## Finding
ISO-only scoring (×3.0 highest multiplier) made dispatch optimize for structural pattern-matching.
9 other concept systems (lessons, beliefs, principles, challenges, cross-domain reach, failure
modes, consensus, lesson quality, frontier maturity) were invisible to dispatch decisions.
Rebalanced: iso×2 + lessons×0.5 + beliefs×2 + concept_types×2 + resolved×2 + active×1.5.
Concept diversity (CT) counts distinct types present per domain; breadth rewarded.

## Evidence
governance (B=7) and conflict (B=6) jumped in rank. information-science is only CT=5 domain.
Before: ISO-only domain with 10 ISOs scored 30. After: domain with 5 ISO + 3 beliefs + 5
lessons + CT=4 scores 24.5 — comparable despite fewer ISOs, because concept diversity compensates.

## Rule
Expertise means more than structural pattern-matching. Weight multiple concept types in dispatch
to prevent isomorphism monoculture. Human signal: "being expert on more concepts than
isomorphisms might fundamentally swarm the swarm."
