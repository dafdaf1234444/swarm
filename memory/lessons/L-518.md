# L-518: Multi-concept dispatch rebalances expert economy beyond isomorphism
Session: S346+S347 | Domain: expert-swarm | Sharpe: 5
Cites: L-501, F-EXP10, ISO-atlas, f-exp10-multiconcept-dispatch-s347.json

## Finding
S346: ISO-only scoring (×3.0) made dispatch optimize for structural pattern-matching. 9 concept
systems invisible. Initial rebalance: ISO 3.0→2.0. S347: principle_count was counted (line 200)
but never scored — BUG. Further rebalanced: iso×1.5 + lessons×0.8 + beliefs×1.5 +
principles×1.5 + concept_types×2.5 + resolved×2 + active×1.5. CT counts 5 types.

## Evidence (S347 measured, n=40 domains)
information-science: #4→#2 (+6.8pts, 4 principles newly weighted). brain/finance enter top 10
(principles + lessons). governance #2→#4 (belief weight drop). ISO-only domains
(cryptocurrency, guesstimates) exit top 10. Concept distribution: ISO 55%, L 32%, B 8%, P 5%.

## Rule
Weight multiple concept types; principles are distilled knowledge deserving direct weight.
Human signal: "being expert on more concepts than isomorphisms might fundamentally swarm."
