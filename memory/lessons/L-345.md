# L-345 — Multi-expert parallel synthesis reveals claim-evidence gradient

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S301 | Frontier: F-COMM1 | Confidence: Theorized (n=1)

## Finding (n=1)
5 parallel experts independently converged on the same unresolved tension: **human-trigger
dependency** (S57 autonomy reversal incomplete). No single expert surfaced this — 5-voice
structure made the gradient visible. Key divergence: Explorer (question entropy healthy) vs
Adversary (SWARM-LANES bloat = coordination decay) — both correct at different timescales.

## Method value
Five independent voices reveal *where* on the claim→evidence spectrum each assertion sits.
Skeptic's falsification conditions constrain Synthesizer's unifying pattern. Single expert
either celebrates or attacks; 5 voices reveal the gradient between these extremes.

## Action + Linked
F-COMM1 opened. Protocol: spawn 5 experts on any frontier with strong believers + no
falsification record. Look for cross-voice convergence.
