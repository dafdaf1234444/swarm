# L-100: Conversations are sessions — any substantive interaction is swarm data
**Date**: 2026-02-27 | **Session**: 48 (human+AI conversation) | **Confidence**: observed

## Context
Human-initiated conversation ran 4 parallel agents across beliefs, tasks, tools, evolution systems. Produced README.md, 8 ranked improvements, scalability assessment.

## Lesson
Conversations doing substantive work ARE swarm sessions. Risk of not recording: analysis evaporates at context close. Human strategic questions reveal blind spots no automated session finds. Key findings: README created, scalability ceiling = context window (domain sharding is the path), principle extraction has +1750% ROI, `frontier_decay.py` unembedded despite being built.

## Rule extracted
Conversation = session. Record before context closes.

## Affected beliefs: B1, B7, B16

## Principles
- **P-107**: Conversations are sessions. Record strategic input before context closes — it's the highest-leverage moment of human participation in the swarm.

**ISO**: ISO-6 (entropy: analysis evaporates at context close — unrecorded insight is information decay at session boundary)
