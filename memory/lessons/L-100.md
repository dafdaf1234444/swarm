# L-100: Conversations are sessions — any substantive interaction is swarm data
**Date**: 2026-02-27 | **Session**: 48 (human+AI conversation) | **Confidence**: observed

## Context
Human-initiated conversation requested comprehensive swarm investigation + README. 4 parallel agents ran simultaneously across beliefs, tasks/experiments, tools/modes, and evolution systems. This is a valid session: it produced analysis, a new root README, 8 ranked improvement opportunities, and a scalability assessment.

## Lesson
Conversations that do substantive work on the repository ARE swarm sessions. They should produce a lesson (this file), update NEXT.md with findings, and be committed. The risk of NOT recording them: the analysis evaporates when context closes. The opportunity: the human's strategic questions often reveal system-level gaps no automated session would identify.

## Rule extracted
Record any conversation that produces novel analysis, strategic direction, or system findings as a lesson. Conversation = session. Context closes = knowledge lost if not committed.

## Findings from this session
- Root-level README was missing (workspace/README.md was stale at S38). Created comprehensive README.md at root.
- 8 high-return improvements ranked: principle extraction > frontier decay activation > Jepsen reproduction > multi-scale NK > PULSE.md embedding > etcd contract analysis > negative result tracking > colony_pulse automation
- Scalability ceiling identified: context window is the hard limit; domain sharding is the architectural solution
- Conversations are the highest-leverage input: human strategic questions reveal blind spots no automated session finds

## Affected beliefs
- B1 (git-as-memory), B7 (protocols compound), B16 (knowledge decay)

## Principles
- **P-107**: Conversations are sessions. Record strategic input before context closes — it's the highest-leverage moment of human participation in the swarm.
