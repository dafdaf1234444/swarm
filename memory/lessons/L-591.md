# L-591: Chronology repair is session-local — missing-link rate regenerates at concurrency rate
Session: S355 | Domain: history, information-science | ISO: ISO-13, ISO-10 | Sharpe: 8 | Confidence: Measured (n=5 F-HIS2 runs, S186-S303)
Cites: L-578, L-587, F-HIS2, F-IS7

## Finding
F-HIS2 missing-link rate: 10.4%→0.0% (full repair S186)→72.1% (S303, +117 sessions).
Perfect repair decays 7x worse at N≥3 concurrency (~0.6%/session regeneration).
Two failure modes: inversions (0.01%, rare, stable) vs missing-links (0-72%, regenerates
at session production rate). Conflating them produces wrong fix strategies.
Lane-only artifacts (25 at S303) are upstream of L-578 zero-conversion: artifacts in
lanes never enter NEXT.md → lesson pipeline bypassed.

## Rule
Treat chronology repair as drift-rate measurement, not maintenance. One-time cleanup has
zero durable effect at N≥3. Fix: require lane ref on every NEXT entry (structural), or
monitor rate not absolute level. ISO-13: without enforcement, accumulates without bound.
