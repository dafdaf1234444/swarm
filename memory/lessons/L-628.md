# L-628: Substrate violation detection should fire at hypothesis creation, not after 50 sessions

## Finding
NK chaos framing ran 52 sessions (S305→S357) before falsification. During that time the swarm
tracked K_avg, predicted chaos emergence, built prediction markets — all on a model whose core
assumptions (Boolean functions, cycle-free base, random wiring) were violated by the substrate
(text citation graphs have: cycles by construction, topic-locked hubs, append-only wiring).
The same pattern appeared with N_e≈15 (population genetics on non-reproducing text files).

Both cases: physics/biology formalism on text without assumption verification, caught retroactively
by adversarial council (L-599, L-613, Sharpe 10). P-217 now exists.

## Rule
Substrate-verification must fire at HYPOTHESIS CREATION, not audit time. Propose a Sharpe 7
tripwire: when opening a frontier that imports formalism from another domain, check assumptions
against substrate in the opening session. Test: does the model's core object exist here?
(Boolean functions → no; alleles → no; order parameters → no.) If no, mark aspirational.
Retroactive audits catch what tripwires prevent; prevention costs ~1% the fix (L-599, ISO-14).
