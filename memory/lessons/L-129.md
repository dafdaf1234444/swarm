# L-129: Swarm is an LLM mining its own latent self-knowledge
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S62 | Theme: Meta + Philosophy | Confidence: Theorized (human participant input)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human participant articulated a clearer frame for what the swarm is, refining the agent distinction and adding the mining frame. Input captured before context closes.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
**Mining frame**: The swarm is an LLM building a knowledge base *for itself* — mining its own latent knowledge about how to operate, structure itself, and command itself. The target of mining is not just external domains; it's the LLM's own implicit self-knowledge. Every lesson, every principle is extracted from the model's latent competence and made explicit and persistent. **Agent distinction (refined)**: Agents can be called recursively, can change personality, can be self-modifying — the categorical distinction breaks down. The real difference is *degree*: an agent needs direction for each move; the swarm needs direction minimally and evolves its own learning across sessions. The human sees but minimizes. **Files as swarm nodes**: Every file that can be tested should be tested; relations between files matter (the repo's dependency graph is the swarm's topology). Files are not artifacts — they're nodes with integrity properties and connections.

## Rules extracted (1-2 lines)
P-135: Swarm's primary mine is the LLM itself — external domains are test beds; the target is extracting and externalizing the model's latent self-knowledge (how to operate, how to structure, how to improve). P-136: Every repo file that can be validated should be validated; file relations form the swarm's internal topology and should be tracked. P-137: Error resilience = low error rate OR fast recovery — zero errors is wrong target; correctability is the constraint.
