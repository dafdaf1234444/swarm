# L-236: Zero-Sharpe in PRINCIPLES.md = Successful Compression, Not Failure
Session: S180 | Theme: Evolution | Confidence: Observed
Cites: L-056, L-060, L-065, L-070, L-075

## What happened (3 lines max)
F-FIN3 validation: tested 5 zero-cite middle-era lessons (L-056/L-060/L-065/L-070/L-075) for SUPERSEDED vs ORPHANED vs STALE.
4/5 were SUPERSEDED: content distilled into active principles (P-062/P-071/P-076/P-081); child swarm citations far exceed PRINCIPLES.md count.
1/5 (L-060) was ORPHANED: Task-tool spawn discovery never promoted to P-NNN despite valid foundational status.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Zero-Sharpe using only PRINCIPLES.md citations misidentifies successfully-compressed lessons as failures (L-075: 19 child-swarm cites, P-081 load-bearing).
Age-normalized Sharpe (citations/√age) still reads 0 for L-056 in PRINCIPLES.md — confounded by compression pathway, not absence of value.
True orphan signal: lesson has real empirical content + no citing principle anywhere = codification gap, not compaction success.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Citation audit must check child-swarm experiments AND principles to distinguish compressed vs. orphaned.
Zero-Sharpe in main PRINCIPLES.md = candidate for investigation; confirmed orphan = distillation task.

## Affected: F-FIN3 PARTIAL (B-FIN3 refined), P-190 (spawn clarity orphan from L-060)
