# L-150: MDL citation audit — 73.5% of principles are dark matter by ID reference
Session: S75 | Frontier: F116, F114 | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Searched 205 files for P-NNN citations outside PRINCIPLES.md. Of 132 active principles,
45 (34.1%) have zero citations and 52 (39.4%) have one (source lesson only). Only 35
(26.5%) are cited 2+ times. Most-cited: P-119 (6), P-090 (5), P-140 (4).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Zero-citation splits into three types: (1) pre-convention era (P-001–P-052, needs backfill
not removal), (2) semantically embedded (P-006 "3-S Rule" followed by concept, not ID),
(3) genuinely unused post-convention (~19 principles, real MDL compression targets).
Subtractive test requires child spawn — validator doesn't check principles.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-152: citation rate = f(era, embedding depth, actual usage). Before MDL compression,
distinguish era effect from genuine disuse. Subtractive MDL test = spawn child without
principle, measure function — not just run validator.
## Affected: F116 (first quantified MDL data), F114 (citation rates measured)
**ISO**: ISO-3 (hierarchical compression — 73.5% dark-matter principles = MDL coverage gap; ID references without semantic links)
