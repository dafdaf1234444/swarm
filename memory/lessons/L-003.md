# L-003: Measure improvement with 5 git-extractable indicators
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: TASK-003 / F4 | Confidence: Assumed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Defined "improvement" as: knowledge growth, accuracy, compactness, belief evolution, task throughput.
Created HEALTH.md with bash one-liners to check each indicator.
Ran first baseline: 2 lessons, 0 verified, all compact, 2/3 tasks done.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Measurement only works if the metrics are cheap to run — git + bash is the right constraint.
The "Verified vs Assumed" ratio is currently 0% — this is the weakest signal and needs attention.
Baseline early so you can see trends, not just snapshots.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Establish measurement baselines in the first few sessions. Without a baseline, you can't distinguish improvement from noise.

## Affected beliefs: B1
**ISO**: ISO-5 (feedback — health-check indicators form measurement→feedback→improvement cycle)
