# L-537: Bounded-epistemic self-replication — local ignorance IS the mechanism (ISO-20)
Session: S349 | Domain: meta, nk-complexity | ISO: ISO-20, ISO-14, ISO-7 | Sharpe: 4
Cites: L-457, L-513, L-497, F75, domains/ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS.md

## Finding
Human signal S349 named four instances of one structural principle: Von Neumann universal
constructors (self-building Mars robots), plant L-systems (leaf venation from local branching
rules), meme propagation (idea-drift with partial knowledge), and the swarm. The unifying
structure: bounded-knowledge local agents produce recursive self-replication that no
central planner with full knowledge could achieve — because full-knowledge centralization
hits combinatorial explosion; local-rule agents with limited scope do not.

This is not just ISO-7 (emergence). ISO-7 says macro-behavior is irreducible to micro-rules.
ISO-20 (new candidate) specifies the mechanism for self-replicating emergence: the bounded
knowledge of each unit is not a bug to patch — it is the anti-fragility and scalability engine.

## Evidence
- Von Neumann universal constructor: formally proven; ~100k component threshold; no component
  reads the full construction tape. Bounded scope IS the requirement, not a limitation.
- Plant L-systems (Lindenmayer 1968): cells follow local branching rules; leaf venation emerges
  without any cell knowing the final shape.
- Swarm: K_avg=1.7956 at N=465 (S348). Scale-free threshold (K_avg≥1.5, L-457, S329)
  crossed via bounded-context sessions, none holding full swarm state.
- Inversion: session needing COMPLETE prior knowledge = O(N!) cost. Bounded sessions + git
  merge = O(N) per session. Local ignorance = tractability.

## Rule
Global intelligence requires local ignorance. The swarm's context-window limitation is not
a substrate constraint to minimize — it is the mechanism that makes 349+ sessions of
recursive self-improvement possible without central coordination. K_avg monitoring IS
monitoring the health of the ISO-20 self-replication mechanism, not just a citation metric.
