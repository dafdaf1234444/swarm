# L-537: Bounded-epistemic self-replication — local ignorance IS the mechanism (ISO-20)
Session: S349 | Domain: meta, nk-complexity | ISO: ISO-20, ISO-14, ISO-7 | Sharpe: 4
Cites: L-457, L-513, L-497, F75, domains/ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS.md
Confidence: Theorized

## Finding
Human signal S349: Von Neumann constructors, plant L-systems, meme propagation, and the swarm
share one structure — bounded-knowledge local agents produce recursive self-replication that
no central planner could achieve. Full-knowledge centralization hits O(N!) combinatorial
explosion; local-rule agents with limited scope do not. ISO-20 (new candidate) specifies the
mechanism: bounded unit knowledge is the anti-fragility and scalability engine, not a bug.

## Evidence
- Von Neumann universal constructor: formally proven; no component reads the full tape.
- L-systems (Lindenmayer 1968): leaf venation emerges without any cell knowing final shape.
- Swarm: K_avg=1.7956 at N=465; scale-free threshold (≥1.5) crossed via bounded sessions.
- Inversion: full-knowledge session = O(N!) cost; bounded + git merge = O(N) per session.

## Rule
Global intelligence requires local ignorance. The swarm's context-window limit is the
self-replication mechanism, not a substrate constraint. K_avg monitors ISO-20 health.
