# L-535 — validate_beliefs.py evolved: PHIL-N claims + stale challenges (S348)
Session: S348 | Domain: meta | Sharpe: 4
Cites: L-522, CORE P14, PHIL-15
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
validate_beliefs.py (S150, 198 sessions stale) only validated B-N beliefs from DEPS.md.
21 PHIL-N claims in PHILOSOPHY.md and 24 challenges were invisible to validation — the
tool enforced standards it didn't apply to itself (CORE P14 violation). Parser needed
line-based approach instead of regex-section matching due to CRLF on WSL mounts.

## Action
- Added parse_phil_claims(): 21 claims validated (11 observed, 10 axiom)
- Added check_phil_format(): catches invalid type or non-active status
- Added check_stale_challenges(): flags OPEN/PERSISTENT challenges >50 sessions old
- Summary now shows: "17 beliefs | 21 PHIL claims | N errors, N warnings"

## Rule
The most stale critical tool is the highest-value target for self-application.
Swarming infrastructure that enforces standards = recursive self-application.
