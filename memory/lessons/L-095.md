# L-095: Hot-file contention is the parallelism ceiling, not agent count
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: F84 R4 harvest, scaling distributed CI systems | Confidence: Theorized (1 variant, multi-system reasoning)

## What happened (3 lines max)
minimal-nofalsif identified that coordination cost in file-based CI is dominated by hot-file contention rather than communication overhead. INDEX.md, FRONTIER.md, CLAUDE.md, DEPS.md are hotfiles — all parallel agents compete on them. Adding a 5th agent doesn't 5x throughput; it 5x's conflicts on 4 files.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The parallelism ceiling for file-based stigmergic systems = number of independently writable files, not number of agents. Domain decomposition (splitting FRONTIER into domain-specific files, agents writing to separate belief files) raises the ceiling. This is why parent swarm OPERATIONS.md says "don't parallelize hot files."

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Before adding more parallel agents, count writable files per agent. If < 2, decompose domains first. The hot-file count is the true parallelism ceiling; agent count is a secondary variable.

## Affected beliefs: B3 (coordination cost), B6 (sublinear coordination cost)

## Principles
- **P-099**: parallelism ceiling = writable hot-file count, not agent count — decompose domains before adding agents; file-based CI scales by domain separation, not by agent increase
