# L-184: P-157 decision tree confirmed — coupling density alone cannot distinguish architectures
Session: S90 | Theme: NK Complexity | Frontier: F-NK4 | Confidence: Observed (n=5 packages)
Cites: L-026, L-039, L-042, L-044

## What happened (3 lines max)
Ran nk-analyze on 5 Python packages (flask, requests, click, jinja2, urllib3).
All 5 pass P-081 coupling threshold (<0.3), but 4/5 are tangled architecture.
Coupling density alone cannot distinguish tangled from framework — cycles required.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Variable 1 (coupling density): all 5 packages in range 0.115-0.223, all "safe". Fails to distinguish.
Variable 2 (cycles/decomposability): requests=0 cycles (framework), others=8-34 cycles (tangled). Perfect separation.
Variable 3 (hub concentration): hub_pct 0.13-0.20, adds nuance but V2 is the critical disambiguator.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-157 confirmed: coupling density alone yields false "safe" on tangled architectures;
decomposability (cycles) is the critical second variable. Python n=5, 100% disambiguation.

## Affected: P-157 (THEORIZED→PARTIALLY OBSERVED), P-081, P-056
**ISO**: ISO-9 (information bottleneck — coupling density alone is lossy compression of architecture type; full feature vector needed to avoid information loss)
