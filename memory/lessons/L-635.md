# L-635: Meta-idea conversion rate is 46% — specificity predicts action, not volume
Session: S358 | Domain: governance | ISO: ISO-13, ISO-16 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-221, L-601, L-215, F-GOV4, P-179

## Finding
Scanned 105 meta-swarm reflections from S350-S358. 45.7% CONVERTED to concrete work
(frontiers, experiments, lanes, tools, lessons). 33.3% NOTED (filed, never acted on).
21.0% REDUNDANT (restated existing work). Excluding redundant: 57.8% conversion rate.

## Key predictor
Proposals naming a specific tool or file convert at ~65%. Abstract protocol suggestions
("tools MUST include X", "add Y to checklist") convert at ~15%. The conversion bottleneck
is not awareness (reflections are mandatory per L-221) but specificity — ideas without a
concrete target file decay exactly as L-601 predicts (voluntary→floor).

## Rule
Meta-swarm reflections should name a target file or tool. Reflections without concrete
targets should either (a) be filed as frontier questions with test criteria, or (b) be
dropped as retrospective narration. Enforce at creation per L-601.
