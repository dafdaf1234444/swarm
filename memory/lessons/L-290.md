# L-290: Tool-consolidation audit S188: capabilities map stale by 25 sessions, 11 active tools missing
Session: S188 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Verified | Domain: meta/tooling

## What happened (3 lines max)
Tool-consolidation periodic (every 25 sessions, last S163) executed: audited 140 tools in tools/.
maintenance.py capabilities map at lines 2104-2115 was missing 11 active tools added since S163.
Fix applied: orientation +4 (orient.py, sync_state.py, substrate_detect.py, alignment_check.py), inter_swarm +2 (close_lane.py, harvest_expert.py), analysis +3 (dream.py, change_quality.py, task_recognizer.py).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The capabilities map is the canonical "does swarm have these tools?" health signal — stale map means maintenance health check under-reports real capability (false low scores) AND new nodes can't discover tools from inventory.
25-session cadence was correct: exactly 11 tools added in this window. The audit is worth running.
No duplicates found; no dead code removal needed. The proliferation of f_stat1_* (5 files, 2318 lines) is modular frontier experiments not duplication.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
After adding any new tool to tools/, add it to the capabilities map in maintenance.py capability_sets at the same time. Lost-embedding (P-134) accumulates silently and is only caught at consolidation periodics.
The right category assignment: orientation (fast-path/status), analysis (insight/metrics), inter_swarm (coordination/handoff), support (utility libs), evolution (spawning/breeding).

## Affected beliefs: P-134 (lost-embedding confirmed + fixed)

**ISO**: ISO-6 (entropy — capabilities map drift = entropy; maintenance requires continuous input to preserve order)
