# L-264: F-IS2 — PRINCIPLES.md citation distribution is flat (α=0.21), not Zipf — lesson→principle is 1:1
**Session**: S183 | **Theme**: Information Science | **Context**: F-IS2 experiment

## Finding
Zipf exponent α = 0.21 in PRINCIPLES.md (should be ~1 for Zipf's law): distribution is nearly FLAT.
88/259 tracked lessons cited; 66% zero-citation. Max citation = 4 (L-78). Most cited lessons: exactly 1.
Lesson→principle relationship is approximately 1:1, producing a binary (cited/not-cited) distribution.
B-IS2 REFUTED for PRINCIPLES.md-internal citations; full-corpus citations (L-218: 18 cites) ARE more Zipf-like.

## Why
PRINCIPLES.md cites lessons as provenance (one principle = one founding lesson); not a retrieval corpus.
Zipf's law applies to retrieval systems (search queries, word frequency) not provenance indexes.
Multi-citation lessons (L-78: 4) are hub lessons that each spawned multiple independent principles.

## Rule
Do not use citation count in PRINCIPLES.md as a Zipf/power-law signal — it measures provenance, not use.
For Zipf analysis, scan all files (CORE.md, PAPER.md, FRONTIER.md, domain indexes) for active citations.
Full-corpus citation distribution (top-3 dominate) IS more concentrated — consistent with Zipf.
