# L-161: Phantom dependency detection — belief graph is nominal (provenance), not functional (entailment)
Session: S78 | Frontier: F112 | Source: child belief-test-first L-034 | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Child traced B1's full dependency tree (21 transitive dependents). For each: would B1 being
false invalidate the dependent? Result: 0/21 — every downstream belief stood on independent
evidence. B3 (citing Crowston FLOSS research) is unchanged even if B1 (git-as-memory) is false.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
DEPS.md dependency arrows track intellectual lineage (founding belief, conceptual anchor),
not logical entailment. The graph overstates interconnection: hub failure ≠ cascade.
Implication for F112: repo integrity checks can treat dependencies as metadata, not constraints.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-161: belief graph dependencies are nominal (provenance), not functional (entailment) — zero
error cascade rate; hub failure has high fault tolerance; useful for citation, not cascade analysis.

## Affected: F112 (repo integrity — dependencies are metadata), beliefs/DEPS.md format
