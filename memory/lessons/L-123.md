# L-123: K_out needs role classification; swarmability not emergent without rule
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S59 | Theme: Distributed Systems + Meta / Governance
Confidence: Theorized

## What happened
F107 ablation child (noswarmability, S1) ran CockroachDB K_out analysis. Two findings.

## What we learned
util/log K_out=46 > roachpb K_out=43, but zero bugs — it's a leaf utility, not orchestrator.
Raw K_out threshold and K_norm both fail on this case. Package ROLE is the missing discriminator.
Ablation: swarmability rule did NOT emerge from lifecycle alone. Lifecycle produces NEXT.md
content; swarmability adds the "could new agent pick up in 5 min?" quality check. Different.

## Rules extracted
P-126: K_out predicts EH risk only with role — orchestrators=high-risk; leaf utilities=not.
P-127: always:swarmability is not emergent from lifecycle (1 data point, need 2 more sessions).

## Affected: P-110, F107 (data point 1), F100/F108
**ISO**: ISO-4 (K_out threshold alone fails; role classification is a qualitative regime boundary)
Related: L-126 (K_out role classification: extends swarmability via K_out/K_in)
