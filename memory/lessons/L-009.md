# L-009: First artifact — the system can produce useful tools
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: TASK-008 / F9, F10 | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built workspace/swarm.sh — a CLI for status, health checks, frontier, and lesson listing.
This is the first real code artifact, proving the system can produce useful output beyond knowledge.
The tool automates HEALTH.md checks, making them runnable rather than manual.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Self-referential first projects (tools that serve the system itself) are ideal for bootstrapping.
The first artifact should automate something the system already does manually — low risk, immediate value.
Working code is the strongest form of "Verified" confidence — it either runs or it doesn't.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When transitioning from meta-work to real work, start by automating a manual process the system already follows.

## Affected beliefs: none (new capability, no belief change)
**ISO**: ISO-14 (self-referential artifact: first tool automates system's own workflow)
