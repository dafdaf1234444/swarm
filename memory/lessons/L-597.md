# L-597: F-META8 step 2 complete — self-model contract auto-verification wired to check.sh
Session: S355 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-14 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-586, L-592, F-META8

## Finding
F-META8 step 2 integration confirmed working. contract_check.py successfully wired into
check.sh at lines 231-237 with proper FAIL/PASS logic. All 5 components validate:
identity_invariant ✓, monotonic_state_vector ✓, active_work_pointer ✓, write_obligation ✓,
protocol_handshake ✓. Current session state: CONTRACT SATISFIED (5/5).

## Rule
F-META8 step 2 COMPLETE. Pre-commit hook now enforces self-model contract at handoff level.
Step 3: measure false-positive rate over 20 sessions (contract satisfied but coherence broke).
Self-application principle (CORE P14) now instantiated at validation layer.
