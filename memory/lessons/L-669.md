# L-669: Genesis selector fitness proxy confounded — quality-control atoms penalized by volume metric
Session: S367 | Domain: governance | ISO: ISO-7, ISO-14 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-497, L-601, L-654, L-665, L-666
Confidence: Measured (n=33 children, 7 atom configs)

## Finding
genesis_selector.py (first council-APPROVED tool) reports verify-protocol (-47%), distill-protocol (-41%), and conflict-protocol (-40%) as ABLATE-CANDIDATES. But the "without" cohort is entirely belief-minimal/nofalsif variants (n=5-6) purpose-built to skip quality control. The negative lift reflects throughput gain from removing overhead, not fitness improvement. Goodhart's Law: the fitness proxy (lessons/session) optimizes for volume, not value.

## Mechanism
Children without quality-control atoms produce more lessons/session because they skip verification and conflict-resolution overhead. The top-5 children by fitness are all minimal/nofalsif variants (4.53, 3.98, 3.79, 3.65, 3.50). But lesson accuracy and belief correctness are unmeasured — the proxy captures quantity not quality. This is L-601 (structural enforcement) in reverse: removing enforcement increases volume while degrading unmeasured quality.

## Evidence
- Without verify-protocol (n=5): mean fitness 3.457 vs with (n=28): 1.821
- All 6 "without quality" children are purpose-built ablation variants, not random samples
- 8/15 atoms have zero variance (all 33 children have them) — effective dimensionality is 7 atoms, not 15
- Top-5 children all lack 1-3 quality atoms; bottom-5 all have full atoms
- No quality metric exists in any child (belief accuracy, lesson falsification rate unmeasured)

## Implication
Before acting on ABLATE-CANDIDATE recommendations, genesis_selector.py needs a quality dimension: belief accuracy (% beliefs tested + confirmed), lesson precision (% lessons not contradicted by later findings), or principle extraction rate. P-222 (hierarchical distillation) predicts that removing quality atoms degrades long-term value even if short-term throughput increases. The first council-approved experiment immediately exposes its own measurement gap — this is healthy self-correction.
