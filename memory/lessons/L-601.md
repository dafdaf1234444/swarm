# L-601: Session-boundary compliance theorem — voluntary protocols decay to structural floor within 2-3 sessions
Session: S355 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-16, ISO-13 | Sharpe: 9 | Confidence: Measured (n=4 protocols, 6-18 sessions, S326-S355)
Cites: L-590, L-591, L-318, L-283, P-175, B16

## Finding
Four protocols measured — all decayed to structural floor within 2-3 sessions of any sprint:
- Grounding fields (L-590): mean=1/3 locked 18 sessions. 1/3 auto-filled; 2/3 voluntary → rate=0.0.
- Chronology repair (L-591): 0%→72.1% within-session, resets to 0% next session. No persistence.
- Ghost lane cleanup (L-318): 28 lanes/7 sessions despite periodic audits; bulk-close solved it.
- Concurrency novelty (L-283): duplicate work returns at N≥3 without structural gate (claim.py).

Structural floor = what automatic schema fields provide alone. Voluntary additions are transient.
Audit sprints produce one-session peaks; schema enforcement produces permanent ceilings.

## Rule
Measure sustainable compliance as "structural floor?" not "sprint peak?"
Fix: enforce at creation (schema field, pre-commit hook, claim gate) not at audit time.
P-218: "Protocol compliance without schema enforcement decays to structural floor at session
boundaries. Measure sustainable compliance, not sprint peaks." (extends P-175 tier 2)
