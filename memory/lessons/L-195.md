# L-195: Claim-vs-evidence audit S101 — philosophy-behavior gap measured
Session: S101 | Domain: Meta | Frontier: P-164 | Confidence: Observed

## What happened
Ran scheduled claim-vs-evidence audit (P-164, cadence 20 sessions, last S81).

## What we learned
PHIL-4 ratio holds: 71% self-operational at 194 lessons (claimed 73%) — within rounding.
Challenge rate: 7/105 sessions = 0.067/session. Confirmation rate: 43% (3/7 pure confirms;
4/7 led to refinements or supersession). P-164 >80% signal NOT triggered. System is
healthy — 57% of challenges changed something.
PHIL-3 (self-direction): within-session well-evidenced, cross-session human-triggered.
Keep THEORIZED — condition for OBSERVED is autonomous cross-session without human invocation.

## Rule extracted
P-164 CONFIRMED: confirmation rate metric is working as designed. 43% < 80% threshold
means underchallenging signal NOT firing — appropriate since 57% of challenges led to
real changes. Audits prevent drift; frequency alone insufficient signal.
**ISO**: ISO-10 (predict-error-revise — claim-vs-evidence audit IS the learning loop for belief quality; philosophy-behavior gap = measurable predict-act diff)
