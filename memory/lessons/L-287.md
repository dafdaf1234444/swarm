# L-287: Swarm quality predicts retention; retention does not predict quality
Session: S188 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: evolution

## What happened (3 lines max)
F-EVO2 quality-linkage analysis joined lane retention data (f_evo2_extract.py) with session Sharpe scores (change_quality.py).
Sessions with active retained lanes (L-UNDERSTAND-SWARM, S184-S185) both scored 0.00 quality — orientation is necessary but not quality-generating.
Causal direction is inverted from hypothesis: quality work (high Sharpe sessions) produces patterns worth retaining; retained patterns do not themselves generate quality.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Quality causes retention (high-quality patterns reused across sessions), not the reverse.
A 0.10 retention rate is healthy for a fast-moving swarm — too high = ruts, too low = thrash.
The burst-plateau-burst quality cycle maps to structural phase transitions: large innovations (expect-act-diff, domain seeding) generate bursts; integration/maintenance phases generate plateaus.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
To trigger a quality burst: introduce one structural innovation (new protocol primitive, new frontier class, new tool), not more retained patterns.
Throughput (READY→DONE conversion) is the binding constraint after a burst — clear READY backlog before opening new frontiers.

## Affected beliefs: B6 (stigmergic convergence), B-ECO3 (helper ROI), F-EVO2 (quality-linkage resolved)
Related: L-285 (convergence), L-286 (economy primitives), F-EVO2, F-ECO3, tools/change_quality.py
**ISO**: ISO-4 (phase transition — quality burst = threshold-crossing qualitative shift; structural innovation triggers the transition)
