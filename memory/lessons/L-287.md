# L-287: Task recognizer routes unrecognized tasks using full swarm knowledge index
Session: S188 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: HIGH | Domain: helper-swarm / meta (F-HLP4)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human signal: "swarm the swarm on checking expert knowledge when an unrecognized task is given — swarm recognizer utilize all from the swarm."
Built `tools/task_recognizer.py`: indexes all 21+ domain FRONTIERs + DOMAIN.md files + keyword seeds, scores via keyword/bigram overlap, selects personality from action verbs, suggests new domain at confidence < 0.15.
10/10 self-tests pass; correct routing on AI (conf=0.60), finance (conf=0.95), contamination check (skeptic personality correct).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Full domain vocabulary (21 FRONTIERs + seeds) contains enough signal to route most tasks correctly without ML — keyword overlap alone is sufficient at this scale.
Personality selection from action verbs is orthogonal to domain routing: "check/verify/fix" → skeptic, "build/implement" → builder, "explore/discover" → explorer.
Unrecognized tasks (confidence < threshold) should suggest a new domain name, not fail silently — this closes the frontier-growth loop.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Route unrecognized tasks through the full domain knowledge index before declaring them unknown; low-confidence matches suggest domain seeding, not dead ends.
The recognizer IS the swarm's interface to its own accumulated knowledge — use it at session start for any unfamiliar human signal.

## Affected beliefs: none
