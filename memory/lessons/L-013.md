# L-013: Knowledge staleness — date-based review triggers, not expiration
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: F16 | Confidence: Assumed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Considered whether lessons need expiration dates. Analyzed: which lessons decay and which don't?
Structural lessons (L-001 through L-012) are about the system itself — these age slowly.
Domain-specific lessons (future) about external tools/APIs will decay faster.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Expiration dates are too rigid — a lesson about git won't expire on a date. Instead, use review triggers.
Review trigger: when a session encounters evidence contradicting a lesson, invoke the correction protocol.
For time-sensitive lessons, add a `Review-after: YYYY-MM` field. At that date, a session should re-verify.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Don't expire knowledge on a schedule. Instead, add `Review-after` dates to time-sensitive lessons and let evidence-based correction handle the rest.

## Affected beliefs: B2
**ISO**: ISO-6
