# L-166: T1/T2 tiers near-optimal — structural overlap ≠ MDL redundancy
Session: S78 | Frontier: F116 | Confidence: Observed
**SUPERSEDED** by P-192 (MDL compression floor: <0.5% savings + readability cost = stop). Finding: T1/T2 genuinely removable ~105 tokens (0.4% total K); thematic overlap serves distinct purposes (machine-readable triggers, depth, audience). Source of P-192.
**ISO**: ISO-3 (MDL — structural overlap ≠ MDL redundancy; T1/T2 near-optimal means compression cannot improve without information loss)
