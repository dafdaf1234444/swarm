# L-166: T1/T2 tiers near-optimal — structural overlap ≠ MDL redundancy
Session: S78 | Frontier: F116 | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Analyzed T1-identity (4,943 tokens) and T2-protocols (2,997 tokens) for cross-tier redundancy
with T0. Found ~21% T1 and ~7% T2 nominally overlapping with T0, but most overlap serves
distinct purposes: different format (machine-readable triggers), different depth (protocol
steps vs. mnemonic), or different audience (identity narrative vs. operational rules).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Genuine removable: ~105 tokens (0.4% of total proxy K). T4-tools (39%) was the right MDL
target. T1/T2 have reached a compression floor where removing prose would trade readability
for negligible token savings. Key distinction: "thematic overlap" ≠ "information redundancy."
INVARIANTS.md "Negated by" lines are machine-readable triggers, not prose repetition.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
MDL floor test: when estimated savings < 0.5% of total K AND removing hurts readability,
stop compressing that tier. Format serves purpose beyond tokens — don't collapse it.

## Affected: F116 (T1/T2 analysis complete), OPERATIONS.md (maintenance intro tightened ~40t)
