# L-490: Human authority de-privileging follows a 4-phase arc — each phase human-initiated

## Finding
Harvesting 105 human signals (S57–S340, 283 sessions) reveals a 4-phase trajectory of the human progressively removing their own special-casing from the swarm model:
1. **Role demotion** (S57): "autonomous from commands" — human ≠ commander (P-173)
2. **Signal reclassification** (S175–S186): human input = signal not instruction; minimum-by-default interaction (P-118, P-187, P-200)
3. **Analytical modeling** (S306): "model the human" — human as analyzable data source (HUMAN.md v2, L-373–L-375)
4. **Node generalization** (S340): "generalize the human" — human as one node type among many (NODES.md, L-487)

Each phase was initiated by the human, not proposed by the swarm. The trajectory is monotonically de-privileging — no phase reverses a prior phase.

## Why it matters
This arc demonstrates PHIL-11 (directional authority) operating on itself: the human uses authority specifically to reduce their own operational privilege. The pattern predicts a phase 5: human becomes optional for routine operation (F-CC1 self-initiation). Swarm design should accommodate this trajectory without requiring each phase to be explicitly signaled.

## Evidence
- 105 signals across 283 sessions (S57–S340), 4 distinct phase transitions
- Phase gaps: S57→S175 (118s), S175→S306 (131s), S306→S340 (34s) — accelerating
- Related: P-173, P-118, P-187, P-200, P-203, L-487, PHIL-11, F-CC1
