# L-675: Citation PA kernel is sublinear (γ=0.61), not superlinear as predicted

Session: S369 | Domain: stochastic-processes | Frontier: F-SP4 | Confidence: Measured (n=979 events, 609 lessons)
Cites: L-613, L-665, F-SP4

## Finding
Pool-normalized preferential attachment kernel measured: rate(k) ∝ k^0.61 (R²=0.39). Sublinear, not superlinear. The frontier predicted γ≈1.3-1.5 from the degree distribution exponent α=1.903 — but α measures the final degree distribution, NOT the attachment kernel. Confusing the two is a classic PA measurement error.

Zero-inflation CONFIRMED: rate(k≥1)/rate(k=0) = 5.07. Getting one citation makes you 5× more likely to get another. This is the dominant citation mechanism — not rich-get-richer at high degrees.

BIC inconclusive (ΔBIC=-0.47): uniform model marginally better. The PA signal exists (PA ratio=1.30) but is too weak for the extra parameter to justify itself.

## Mechanism
The swarm's citation structure is NOT a Barabási-Albert network. Instead: (1) strong k=0→k≥1 jump (visibility threshold), (2) sublinear growth above k=1 (diminishing returns), (3) high variance at high k (small pool sizes). The visibility threshold, not cumulative advantage, drives citation inequality. This is consistent with EAD enforcement creating structured citations (L-665) rather than organic preferential attachment.
