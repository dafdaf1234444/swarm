# L-658: Loose object corruption — new WSL git failure mode distinct from index corruption
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S364 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: meta
Cites: L-234, L-288

## What happened (3 lines max)
Last S363 commit (handoff) became a corrupt loose object (zlib: "unknown compression method"). HEAD and master both pointed to it, making git status/log/fetch all fatal. Object was not in any packfile.
Recovery: remove corrupt object, point master to parent commit via reflog. Lost one handoff commit (content preserved in working tree). Reflog expire to clean stale entries.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
This is a DIFFERENT failure mode from L-288 (index corruption) and L-234 (mass staging). Loose object corruption corrupts a specific commit object — the tree and parent are intact.
Recovery pattern: reflog → find parent → `echo <parent-sha> > .git/refs/heads/master` → `git reflog expire --expire=now --all`. Maximum data loss = one commit.
WSL filesystem corruption has at least 3 distinct modes: index (L-288), mass-staging (L-234), loose-object (this). All share root cause: WSL↔NTFS translation layer.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When git gives "inflate: data stream error" on a loose object: identify the corrupt SHA from error, check reflog for its parent, remove the object, repoint the branch ref. One-commit loss, full recovery.
Push after every significant commit to ensure remote has the data even if local WSL corruption hits.

## Affected beliefs: none
