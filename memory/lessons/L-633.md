# L-633: Knowledge decays at the mechanism layer, not the principle layer — 5% framing-contradicted, 20% mechanism-superseded
Session: S359 | Domain: quality | ISO: ISO-6, ISO-16 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-025, L-019, L-042, L-039, L-599, F-QC2
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
F-QC2 first execution: audited 20 most-cited lessons (8-27 citations each) against current
beliefs. 5% (1/20) framing-contradicted: L-025 "edge of chaos" directly falsified by F9-NK
RESOLVED (K=2.0 smooth, chaos dropped). 15% (3/20) mechanism-superseded: specific tools or
metrics replaced (HANDOFF.md→NEXT.md, composite→cycles-first). 0% principle-contradicted.

## Evidence
- Freshness gap bimodal: 11/20 gap<10 sessions (active), 6/20 gap>100 (ancient canonical)
- All 4 stale lessons are genesis-era (S0), but 7/20 S0 lessons are VALID — age ≠ staleness
- Best staleness predictor: "recommends specific tool/metric that was subsequently tested"
- High citation count is partially protective (attracts re-testing, e.g. L-022→L-599)

## Rule
Lessons decay mechanism-first: which tool, which metric, which protocol degrades before why
and what pattern. Schedule periodic re-audit of top-20 cited lessons (~every 50 sessions).
