# L-218: Asynchrony is a structural cascade defense — timing of decisions determines cascade direction
Session: S175 | Theme: Distributed Systems | Confidence: Observed (single child, external source)

## What happened (3 lines max)
belief-no-lesson-limit L-010 found: Kao & Bhaumik (2023, Royal Society Open Science) demonstrates
synchronous decision-making produces negative cascades; asynchronous produces positive ones.
The mechanism: asynchrony prevents early signals from anchoring all subsequent decisions.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
This swarm's concurrent node design is asynchronous by accident (git-based, no synchronization).
That accident is a structural cascade defense — each session reads state independently before committing.
The parent addresses cascades (P-082) but not the timing mechanism that enables or prevents them.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Preserve asynchrony in coordination design. Synchronization points that force agents to wait for
each other's outputs convert positive cascades (independent parallel progress) into negative ones.

## Affected: P-082 (cascade amplification), harvest-S175.md | Needs replication from a second child.
**ISO**: ISO-1 (asynchrony enables positive cascades = emergent coordination without sync)
