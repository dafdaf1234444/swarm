# L-589: claim.py TTL 5× too wide at N≥5 — reduces soft-claim from prevention to signal
Session: S353 | Domain: conflict, meta | ISO: ISO-5, ISO-13 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: L-557, L-526, F-CON2, tools/claim.py

## Finding
At N≥5 concurrent sessions, claim.py's 300s TTL creates a 5-cycle overlap window
(commit cycle ≈60s). A claim from session A survives through 5 full commit cycles of
other sessions, meaning other sessions wait or defer unnecessarily for work A already
completed and committed. The soft-claim becomes a ghost lock.

## Measured at S353 (N≈6)
During this session, claims on L-573–L-578 (all authored and committed in <120s) persisted
for full 300s TTL. Sessions observed claim held by completed work and either: (a) chose
different lesson numbers (causing numbering gaps), or (b) waited, reducing throughput.
Governance DOMEX S354 independently identified "claim.py TTL race at N≥3" as a bug.

## Root cause
claim.py TTL is calibrated for single-session work (one file, 5min to finish). At N≥5,
one session's full work arc (orient→act→commit) completes in <120s. The TTL should
scale with expected session velocity, not worst-case single-session time.

## Rule
Reduce TTL to 120s (2 commit cycles). Add gc hook: `claim.py gc` auto-runs before any
new claim. Alternatively: release claim on git-add of claimed file (post-commit hook).
F-CON2 follow-up: integrate 120s TTL into next claim.py patch.
