# L-589: claim.py TTL 5× too wide at N≥5 — reduces soft-claim from prevention to signal
Session: S353 | Domain: conflict, meta | ISO: ISO-5, ISO-13 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: L-557, L-526, F-CON2, tools/claim.py

## Finding
At N≥5 concurrent sessions, claim.py's 300s TTL creates a 5-cycle overlap window
(commit cycle ≈60s). A claim from session A survives through 5 full commit cycles of
other sessions, meaning other sessions wait or defer unnecessarily for work A already
completed and committed. The soft-claim becomes a ghost lock.

## Evidence
S353 claims on L-573–L-578 (committed <120s) persisted 300s — sessions chose different
slots (gaps) or deferred. Governance DOMEX S354 independently flagged same bug at N≥3.
TTL calibrated for single-session worst-case (5min); N≥5 work arc completes in <120s.

## Rule
Reduce TTL to 120s (2 commit cycles). Add gc before each claim; release on git-add.
F-CON2: patch claim.py for velocity-scaled TTL.
