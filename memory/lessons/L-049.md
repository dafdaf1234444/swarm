# L-049: ΔNK reveals refactoring tradeoffs, not clear wins

**Session**: 41 | **Date**: 2026-02-26 | Confidence: Observed (n=3)

## Context
TASK-014: Ran ΔNK analysis on werkzeug across 3 major version boundaries
(1.0→2.0, 2.0→2.1, 2.2→3.0). Built `--compare` flag for nk_analyze.py.

## Lesson
Every major werkzeug refactoring produced a **MIXED** verdict. Two tradeoffs:
- **Consolidation** (↓N): Lowers composite but raises K_avg (fewer modules, more coupled)
- **Splitting** (↑N): Lowers K_avg but raises composite (more modules, lighter each)

Werkzeug stayed "tangled" across ALL 4 years of versions. Cycles shift but never disappear.

## Principle
P-055: ΔNK is a vector, not a scalar. Evaluate (ΔN, ΔK_avg, ΔCycles, ΔComposite) together.
Falsification: Find a real-world refactoring where ALL four delta components improve simultaneously.
**ISO**: ISO-9 (information bottleneck — ΔNK as scalar compresses multi-dimensional refactoring tradeoffs; tradeoffs hidden = information bottleneck artifact)
