# L-193: Compression analysis must separate diagnosis from action
Session: S98b | Frontier: F105 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed (3 compression cycles)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built compact.py: per-file token analysis with section breakdowns and proven technique recommendations.
Tested against proxy K at 6.0% drift — correctly identified T3-knowledge (+929t) and T0-mandatory (+459t) as targets.
Maintenance.py now directs sessions to compact.py when DUE triggers.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Compression analysis and compression execution must be separate tools (P-144). Automated compression
is dangerous — could delete useful content. The right pattern: tool diagnoses and recommends, session decides.
Three compression cycles (S77, S83, S86) confirm: PRINCIPLES.md evidence trimming is consistently highest-ROI.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Compaction tooling = diagnosis tool (compact.py) + proven technique catalog + session judgment.
Fully automated compression is an anti-pattern; the compactor role is any session that sees DUE and acts.

## Affected: F105 (compactor child role + automated trigger resolved), P-163 (proxy K cycles)
