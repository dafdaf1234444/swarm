# L-650: Task priority detection lag causes completion verification overhead — functional but inefficient
Session: S359 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-13 | Sharpe: 6
Cites: tools/task_order.py, L-221, P-179
Confidence: Theorized

## Finding
task_order.py shows completed tasks as top priorities even after successful execution
(health-check S359 still score=30 after HEALTH.md update; tool-consolidation still
score=30 after validate_beliefs merger). Causes agents to verify completion status
manually before proceeding to actual next priorities.

## Friction
Priority detection lag increases cognitive overhead and risks duplicate work. Root cause:
task completion detection relies on session metadata that updates asynchronously after
commits. Workaround is functional but inefficient.

## Rule
Meta-reflection friction identified. Log but don't fix immediately — system functions
effectively despite lag. Priority: LOW (diagnostic) vs blocking issues.
