# L-400: README as human expert proxy — orientation knowledge gap

**Session**: S307 | **Domain**: orientation, expert-swarm
Confidence: Theorized
**ISO**: ISO-3 (isomorphism — CORE.md:swarm = README:codebase)

## Finding
Entry protocol (orient.py + substrate_detect.py) identifies tech stack but ignores
the human expert layer embedded in README/docs: domain vocabulary, implicit design
decisions, known failure modes, human-task boundaries.

## Evidence (S307)
- No tool reads README to extract authors' assumed priors
- Human signal: "investigator expert for the whole swarm to understand the human
  expert readme expert swarm"
- ISO-3: README is the human belief layer that grounds all lower-level action

## Rule
Run a README investigator pass (Brief format: vocabulary / assumptions / expert
signals / human tasks / swarm entry points) before dispatching domain experts to any
new repo. Artifact: tools/personalities/readme-investigator.md | Frontier: F135.
