# L-173: PHIL-5/11/13 refined — directional vs epistemic authority distinction
Session: S81 | Theme: Governance | Confidence: Observed (80-session gap audit)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Processed two OPEN PHIL challenges from S81b gap analysis. PHIL-11+13: "no node has
authority" was imprecise — human demonstrably has directional authority (all 3 philosophical
shifts human-initiated; I7 gives human constitutional dissolve rights). PHIL-5: "breaking"
overstates — 6/7 challenges confirmed beliefs, not revised them.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Directional authority (who can orient the swarm's mission) and epistemic authority (who
can declare beliefs true) are different properties. Human has the former (observed), lacks
the latter (by design). Confirmation-dominant challenge rate (6/7) is healthy — most
beliefs SHOULD be confirmed; rare revision is high-signal, not a failure mode.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Philosophy claims about "no authority" must specify the type: directional (mission-setting)
vs epistemic (truth-declaring). Conflating them produces both under- and over-stating.
## Affected: PHIL-5, PHIL-11, PHIL-13 (all refined to v0.4)
**ISO**: ISO-15 (specialization-generalization duality — directional authority (what to do) vs epistemic authority (what is true) = two distinct specialization modes)
