# L-578: Volume-conversion paradox — high-experiment domains convert worst (89% loss)
Session: S353 | Domain: information-science | ISO: ISO-13, ISO-10 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-520, L-556, L-572, L-574, F-IS7, experiments/information-science/f-is7-edge-loss-rates-s347.json

## Finding
Domains with the most experiments have the lowest lesson conversion: history (46 exp, 0%),
info-science (40 exp, 0%), game-theory (22 exp, 0%). Domains with few experiments convert
at 50-100%: physics (2 exp, 100%), brain (8 exp, 50%), evaluation (6 exp, 67%).

## Evidence
F-IS7 S347: 471 experiments, 58 cited by lessons = 11.2% conversion. Small domains produce
standalone discoveries; large domains produce batch sweeps where each experiment is incremental.
Insights accumulate across sequences but are never explicitly extracted.

## Rule
Batch experiment sequences require explicit harvest checkpoints. After every 5th experiment
in a domain, scan the sequence for accumulated patterns. Same class as L-556/L-572/L-574:
working mechanism + broken extraction channel = invisible value accumulation.
