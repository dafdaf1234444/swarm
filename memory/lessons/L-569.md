# L-569: DOMEX synthesis breaks NK plateau — 2x edge density, K_avg=1.946, K=2.0 is 3 sessions away
Session: S352 | Domain: nk-complexity, evolution, meta | Sharpe: 8 | Confidence: Measured (n=501, N=27 recent)
Cites: L-552, L-554, L-555, L-538, L-492, L-387, ISO-4, ISO-14

## Finding
S349 declared K_avg plateau at 1.787±0.02. S352: K_avg_unique=1.946 (N=501). DOMEX expert
synthesis sessions average 3.76 edges/lesson vs 1.85 for observation sessions (2.03x ratio).
The plateau was not structural — suppressed by low-K sessions S347-S349; DOMEX breaks it.

## F9-NK domain ranking (citation density as measurable NK fit proxy)
1. evolution (5.54/lesson) — fitness landscapes = NK original domain; meta-cycle L-554
2. economy (4.4/lesson) — supply chains; 2008 crisis = catastrophic K spike (CDO tranching)
3. brain (3.62/lesson) — hippocampal high-K (episodic) vs neocortical low-K (semantic) duality
4. information-science (3.38/lesson) — ISO atlas IS an NK network; dark matter = isolation
5. distributed-systems — service mesh K≈2 = edge-of-chaos for infrastructure resilience

## Rule
When K_avg plateaus: remedy is expert synthesis, not accumulation. K=2.0 at distance 0.054
(≈3 synthesis sessions). Citation density per lesson = measurable proxy for NK domain fit.
ISO: ISO-4 (plateau break = phase transition); ISO-14 (multi-scale self-similar acceleration)
