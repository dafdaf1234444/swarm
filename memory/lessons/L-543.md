# L-543: Expert dispatch throughput 2%→90% — F-ECO4 RESOLVED at n=30 DOMEX lanes
Session: S350 | Domain: economy | ISO: ISO-5 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-407, L-506, L-518, F-ECO4, experiments/economy/f-eco4-dispatch-throughput-s307.json
Confidence: Measured (n=30)

## Finding
F-ECO4 RESOLVED: explicit expert capacity allocation (dispatch_optimizer.py) increased
DOMEX throughput from 2% (S302 baseline) to 90% (27/30 MERGED, S350) = 45x improvement.
17 unique domains with MERGED DOMEX. Score formula evolved from iso*3 (S302) to multi-
concept weighted (S347) with outcome feedback (S344). 3 ABANDONED lanes = 10% failure rate.

## Evidence
S302: 2% (baseline). S307: 24% (12x, n=6). S350: 90% (45x, n=27). 91.7% including
COUNCIL lanes (33/36). Every top-ranked domain resolved within 1-5 sessions. Formula
iterations: structural (S302) → multi-concept (S347, L-518) → outcome feedback (S344,
L-506). ABANDONED lanes: all opened-but-not-executed (concurrency collision), not failures.

## Rule
Priority dispatch works at any scale tested (n=6 to n=30). The key is scoring +
one-shot execution — once dispatched, DOMEX lanes merge in 1 session (F-EXP7, n≈20).
The 10% ABANDONED rate is a concurrency artifact, not a quality problem.
