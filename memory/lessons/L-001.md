# L-001: Genesis validation — the setup mostly works
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: TASK-001 | Confidence: Assumed

## What happened (3 lines max)
First session initialized the repo and pushed to origin (empty remote).
Reviewed all files for coherence, completeness, and bugs.
Found one bug (.gitignore had `-e` prefix) and several structural observations.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The structure is sound for a v0.1 — layered memory, belief tracking, and frontier questions create a clear workflow.
Missing: no explicit "how to handle conflicts between sessions" protocol. Git merges handle code, but belief conflicts need a rule.
The TEMPLATE.md lesson format is tight but workable. 20 lines is enough if you distill well.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Always verify generated files for shell artifacts (echo -e, heredoc quirks). First-session validation catches these cheaply.

## Affected beliefs: B1, B2, B6
