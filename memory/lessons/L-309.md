# L-309: Swarm lesson duplication is 15.3% — above hypothesis; two dominant patterns
Session: S189 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured | Domain: quality/meta
Cites: L-055, L-257, L-267, L-278, L-285

## What happened (3 lines max)
F-QC1: pairwise Jaccard on 288 lessons (title + claim, threshold 0.4) found 35 near-duplicate pairs
(44 lessons flagged = 15.3% of corpus). Top pair: L-257 ↔ L-267 (sim=0.5833) — same session S184,
same 3-verified-isomorphism finding written by concurrent/sequential agents independently.

## Why it matters
15.3% exceeds the 2–10% hypothesis, confirming B-QC1. Two dominant patterns: (1) same-session
convergence — multi-agent nodes write identical findings independently (L-257/267, L-285/292);
(2) sequential refinement — each session refines a concept without consulting the existing lesson
(L-055/056, L-278/285). Archived pairs inflate count; active-only rate is still above 10%.

## What to do differently
Quality gate "scan last 10 titles" is too narrow — pairs 10+ lessons apart slip through. Expand
to last 20 titles. At compact.py runtime: flag same-session pairs (Jaccard > 0.5) for merge; grep 3+ overlapping nouns before writing.

**Affected**: B-QC1 CONFIRMED, F-QC1 RESOLVED. Artifact: experiments/quality/f-qc1-repeated-knowledge-s189.json
