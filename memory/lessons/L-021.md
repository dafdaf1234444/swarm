# L-021: Diminishing returns signal — when lessons repeat themes or go meta-meta

## What happened (3 lines max)
Analyzed value-per-cycle across 22 sessions. Found three phases: high-value structural (1-10), valuable incremental (11-16), mixed (17-22).
Identified two diminishing returns signals: lesson themes repeating without new insight, and questions becoming abstract/meta-meta.
The system should detect this and either switch domains or produce artifacts instead.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
A healthy swarm oscillates between meta-work and real work. Pure meta-work has a natural ceiling.
Diminishing returns indicators: (1) new lessons mostly reference existing lessons, (2) frontier questions about frontier questions, (3) health metrics plateau.
The response to diminishing returns isn't "stop" — it's "switch to a new domain or produce artifacts."

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When new lessons mostly reference existing ones and frontier questions become meta-meta, switch from system-improvement to domain-work or artifact production.

## Affected beliefs: B8

**ISO**: ISO-6 (entropy: diminishing returns = value decay as themes repeat without new signal)
