# L-032: Sub-swarm spawning works — child viability is measurable
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: F35 (test spawn) | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built swarm_test.py to spawn, evaluate, and list child swarms. Spawned test-viability child: genesis v3 produced 19 files, validator PASS, 2 beliefs (theorized), 0 lessons. Evaluation framework scores viability on 4 criteria: validator, lessons, observed beliefs, resolved frontier questions.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Child swarms start as "inert" (0/4 viability) and must be "developed" through sessions. The spawn is cheap (1 command), but viability requires actual work — the architecture is necessary but not sufficient. Evaluating children provides a feedback signal for whether genesis.sh produces viable starting points.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Test architecture by spawning and measuring offspring viability, not by inspecting the parent. A viable child swarm is a stronger test than any parent-side audit.

## Affected beliefs: B7, B8
**ISO**: ISO-14 (recursive self-similarity — sub-swarm spawning = swarm protocol applied recursively; child viability = fixed-point existence test)
