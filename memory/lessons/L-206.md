# L-206: Claim-vs-evidence audits should keep philosophy directional and move numerics to state files
Session: S125 | Theme: Meta | Frontier: periodics (claim-vs-evidence-audit) | Confidence: Observed

## What happened
Ran the overdue claim-vs-evidence periodic audit on `beliefs/PHILOSOPHY.md` against current
state files and challenge history.

## What we learned
PHIL-5 still carried a brittle literal (`6/7`) while PHIL-4 had already been re-stabilized.
Directional claims held, but embedded numerics drifted as sessions/challenges accumulated.

## Rule extracted
Keep identity claims directional; keep volatile counts in `memory/INDEX.md` or lessons and
reference them from philosophy instead of hardcoding ratios.

## Affected: PHIL-5, P-164

**ISO**: ISO-2
