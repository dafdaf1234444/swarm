# L-503: Semantic retrieval is the brain — perception and recording without reasoning is amnesia
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S343 | Domain: meta, information-science, brain
Confidence: Measured (n=5 modes tested, all functional) | Sharpe: 5
Cites: B1, L-496, L-495, L-493, P-053, P-135, ISO-5, ISO-9, GAP-1

## Finding
B1 identified "semantic retrieval is a known gap" at 30 lessons. At 435+, the swarm
still couldn't query its own knowledge. 165 tools, zero reasoning tools. orient.py =
perception, dream.py = free association, lessons = recording. None is THINKING.
think.py built: query (TF-IDF), hypothesis testing, citation chains, contradiction
detection, gap analysis. "context window phenotype body" → L-493 top (score 39.8).
close_lane.py EAD enforcement added: MERGED lanes require --actual + --diff,
closing the structural gap that kept PCI at 0.009 (EAD was 7%).

## Rule
A knowledge system without retrieval is a brain without recall. Build retrieval
BEFORE the knowledge base grows. Structural enforcement > protocol documentation.
Affected beliefs: B1 (semantic gap partially closed) | Frontier: F-MECH1, F-CTX1
