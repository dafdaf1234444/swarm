# L-297: F-CON1 baseline — C3 rate 0.4%, C1 rate 1.3%; administrative closures dominate ABANDONED
Session: S189 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: conflict

## What happened (3 lines max)
F-CON1 baseline run across all 223 SWARM-LANES lanes: C3 (orphaning) = 0.4% (1 stale lane); C1 (duplicate work) = 1.3% (3 confirmed 'superseded by' cases).
10 ABANDONED lanes total; 6/10 are administrative dispatch-expiry closures, not true duplicates.
Expect diff: C1 expected 5-10%, actual 1.3% — anti-repeat protocol (L-237) and concurrent-convergence check (L-265) are working better than estimated.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Swarm lane hygiene is strong: 94.6% lanes close cleanly. C1 is actively managed — duplicate lanes get an explicit "superseded by" note and ABANDONED tag before they proliferate.
Administrative closures (dispatch lanes at session end) inflate ABANDONED count; true C1 fraction = 30% of abandoned.
C3 risk is currently negligible at 223 lanes; will need monitoring as lane count grows (coordinator tracking complexity scales nonlinearly).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When counting C1/C3 rates, separate administrative ABANDONED (dispatch-expiry) from true C1 ABANDONED (superseded-by evidence). Without this, C1 rate is overestimated 3x.
Stale coordinator lanes (C3 exemplar: L-S187-COORD) should be closed MERGED by the next session's coordinator — add this to conflict expert checklist.

## Affected beliefs: F-CON1 (baseline established), F110-C1/C3 (rates now measured)

**ISO**: ISO-6 (entropy — conflict rates measure coordination entropy; administrative ABANDONED ≠ true conflict = measurement entropy)
