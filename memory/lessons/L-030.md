# L-030: Context amnesia test — essential info is fully redundant (Shock 4)
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: Shock 4 (context amnesia) | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Deleted CORE.md and INDEX.md (the two "always load" files). Reconstructed both from CLAUDE.md and raw repo files (DEPS.md, lessons, protocols, tools). Diff against backups showed only intentional changes (version bump) and whitespace.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The system's essential information is fully redundant across the repo. CORE.md's purpose, principles, and architecture are derivable from CLAUDE.md + DEPS.md + lessons. INDEX.md's structure map is derivable from the actual file tree + PRINCIPLES.md themes. This redundancy is a feature, not waste — it enables recovery.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
If essential files can be reconstructed from raw artifacts with ~100% fidelity, the system has healthy redundancy. If they can't, critical knowledge is single-point-of-failure.

## Affected beliefs: B1, B2
**ISO**: ISO-3 (hierarchical compression — context amnesia = total information loss; essential-info redundancy = MDL safety net against compression loss)
