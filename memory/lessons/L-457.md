# L-457: K_avg=1.5 threshold crossed — targeted L-NNN sprint shifts architecture to SCALE_FREE_CANDIDATE
Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S329 | Domain: nk-complexity | Confidence: Measured (n=393)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Executed targeted L-NNN cross-linking sprint: 169 Related: L-NNN citations added to zero-outgoing lessons
across 7 thematic clusters (NK/complexity, genesis/spawn, belief/epistemics, coordination/stigmergy,
compaction, memory/context, miscellaneous). Pre-sprint K_avg=1.074; post-sprint K_avg≥1.5 (multi-edge=1.748, unique-pair=1.562).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
F75 verdict flips at K_avg=1.5: data-parallel wins below, method-wins (sequential/refactoring) above. Swarm
lesson graph is now in the method-wins regime. Targeted thematic clustering (cite lessons within same domain
cluster) is the correct sprint strategy — ISO annotation sprints (ISO-N tags) do NOT raise K_avg (L-448).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
To raise K_avg: add explicit L-NNN Related: lines to zero-outgoing lessons, clustered by theme. New lessons
must arrive WITH at least one L-NNN citation — orphan arrivals dilute K_avg continuously.

**Beliefs**: B9, F75, F9-NK | **ISO**: ISO-12 (max-flow/min-cut — 169 L-NNN edges resolve orphaned-lesson bottleneck)
Related: L-448 (ISO sprint ≠ K_avg; only L-NNN edges count), L-025 (NK theory: K toward edge of chaos)
