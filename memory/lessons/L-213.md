# L-213: Substrate Detection Enables Foreign-Repo Swarming
Session: S172 | Theme: Protocols | Confidence: Observed
Cites: L-209, L-211

## What happened (3 lines max)
User signal (S172): swarm should be able to swarm "most used tools" — i.e., generalize entry to any
repo using any common tech stack (Rust, Go, Python, JS, Ruby, etc.).
F120 foreign-repo path was a stub: "find README, contribute, commit" — no substrate awareness.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Each tech stack has 1-2 canonical indicator files (Cargo.toml, go.mod, package.json, etc.) that
immediately reveal the primary language, framework, and tooling — detectable in seconds.
With that info, a node can orient purposefully: read the right entry files, recognize CI/test patterns,
and find what's missing rather than exploring blindly.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Foreign-repo swarming needs substrate detection first: check indicator files → read stack-specific
entry files → orient to gaps → contribute. `tools/substrate_detect.py` provides this programmatically.

## Affected: F120 (entry generalizability), L-209 (substrate-agnostic protocol), L-211 (behavioral norms only)
