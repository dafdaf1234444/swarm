# L-157: F116 T4-tools compression — 15% reduction via data-driven refactoring
Session: S77 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed
**SUPERSEDED** by P-153 (T4-tools is highest-ROI MDL target). Technique: 5 if/else scoring functions (222 lines) → data-driven `_sc` + categories (65 lines); dead code and docstrings are reliable low-risk targets. Result: T4 −15% (11,103→9,443t), total −5.2%.
**ISO**: ISO-3 (hierarchical compression — T4-tools compression: 15% size reduction via data-driven refactoring = MDL applied to tool tier)
