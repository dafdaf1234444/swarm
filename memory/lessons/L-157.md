Session: S77 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed
**SUPERSEDED** by P-153 (T4-tools is highest-ROI MDL target). Technique: 5 if/else scoring functions (222 lines) → data-driven `_sc` + categories (65 lines); dead code and docstrings are reliable low-risk targets. Result: T4 −15% (11,103→9,443t), total −5.2%.
