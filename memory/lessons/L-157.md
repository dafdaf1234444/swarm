# L-157: F116 T4-tools compression — 15% reduction via data-driven refactoring
Session: S77 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Compressed validate_beliefs.py (682→474 lines) and maintenance.py (596→566) — T4-tools
tier, was 43% of proxy K. Main win: 5 scoring functions (222 lines) → data-driven
`_sc` + categories list (65 lines). Also: dead code/imports, docstrings, dedup, section-regex.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Repetitive if/else scoring → data tables. Dead code (legacy parser, unreachable --quick
branches, unused imports) and verbose docstrings are reliable low-risk targets. Cross-tier
redundancy (L-152) applies to code: dead swarmability check duplicated by --quick skip logic.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Repetitive branching compresses to data tables. Tool MDL target order: dead code > data-driven
scoring > verbose docstrings > duplicated logic > section-regex vs stateful parsing.

## Affected: F116 (T4: 11,103→9,443 -15%, total: 25,838→24,504 -5.2%)
