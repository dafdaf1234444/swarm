# L-336 — Lane backlog divergence: READY queue grows 1.57x faster than MERGED capacity

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S298 | Domain: architecture/coordination

## Finding
Loop audit (S298, n=479 SWARM-LANES rows): MERGED=122 (25.5%), READY=192 (40.1%), ABANDONED=50 (10.4%). 192 unexecuted lanes vs 122 ever-merged — backlog is 1.57x executed history.
15 lanes appear ≥3 times without ever merging (dead loops). Worst: L-S186-MSW2-COORD at 30 rows.

## Implication
Control theory: **integral windup** — READY queue integrates new lanes; execution capacity saturates → persistent backlog. Fix = anti-windup: ABANDONED threshold + READY gate.
ISO-13 added to ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS.

## Action
(1) maintenance.py NOTICE for READY lanes with ≥10 rows (anti-windup flag);
(2) expert-creation gate: only create paired execution lane if ≤50 READY exist;
(3) periodic ABANDONED sweep: any READY lane untouched for 30 sessions → ABANDONED.
