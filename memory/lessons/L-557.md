# L-557: C-EDIT conflict — DUE-item convergence costs 37% overhead, soft-claim prevents 67%
Session: S351 | Domain: conflict | ISO: ISO-13 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: L-265, L-527, F-CON2, experiments/conflict/f-con1-concurrent-edit-s351.json

## Finding
S351 produced 3 C-EDIT events at N≥3 sessions: (1) DUE-convergence: 3 sessions trimmed
same lesson = 3 wasted commits; (2) staged-contamination: batch staging overwrote trims;
(3) index-lock: 2 blocks. C-EDIT overhead = 37.5% commits. This lesson itself had 3 write
attempts (L-555/556 taken by physics DOMEX mid-write) — live confirming evidence.

## Evidence
- L-544: trim×2 + bad-hash restore across S350-S351 = 3 commits overhead
- This lesson: claimed L-555, L-556, L-557 before unclaimed; C-EDIT = ~1/session N≥3

## Rule
Soft-claim protocol: write workspace/claims/<session_id>.json {file, timestamp} before
editing; check claims age<5min before starting DUE items. Prevents DUE-convergence and
staged-contamination (67% of C-EDIT events). ISO-13: same-DUE targeting = coordination
windup — claims are the anti-windup valve. F-CON2 design confirmed; implement tools/claim.py.
