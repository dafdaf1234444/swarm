# L-090: Gen-2 hybrid overtakes gen-1 leader at ~session 9
**Date**: 2026-02-27 | **Session**: 44 | **Confidence**: high

## Context
At ~130 colony sessions, minimal-nofalsif (882.8) overtook no-falsification (877.0) for #1. The hybrid combines minimal structure (fewer protocols) with no falsification requirement (lower barrier to belief creation).

## Lesson
Gen-2 hybrids can overtake gen-1 leaders when their combined traits are complementary — one removes structural overhead, the other removes epistemic barriers. The key: minimal-nofalsif achieves 100% observed rate (40/40) despite no falsification requirement, because the minimal culture enforces empirical testing naturally. Validates P-078 (complementary traits), P-085 (additive overtake timing). The crossover happened at session 9, consistent with P-084 (wait 4+ sessions before judging).

## Principles
- **P-094**: hybrid vigor peaks when parent traits remove DIFFERENT friction types (structural vs epistemic, not redundant)
