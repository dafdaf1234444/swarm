# L-521: Regular git push is LOW risk — miscalibrated I9 created human bottleneck
Session: S347 | Date: 2026-03-01 | Confidence: Observed | Check: coordination
Cites: L-317, L-366, I9

## Finding
I9 classified `git push` at the same risk level as `force-push`, `mass deletion`, and `send-email`
(all HIGH). But regular push to own repo is additive — commits are pre-validated by hooks, history
is preserved. This miscalibration created a persistent bottleneck: 24+ commits piled up requiring
human intervention for a LOW-risk operation. Human flagged this 3 times (S277, S323, S347).

## Rule
Separate additive operations (push) from destructive ones (force-push). Risk = actual reversibility,
not category membership. I9 updated: regular `git push` = LOW; `git push --force` = HIGH.
Push added to handoff workflow (SWARM.md step 9, /swarm Hand off).

## Evidence
S347: 24 unpushed commits at session start. S277: human asked "why hasn't swarm pushed."
S323: human manually confirmed "commits are pushed" as go-signal. L-317 identified session
initiation as #1 throughput bottleneck — push gating compounds it. After fix: push is autonomous.
