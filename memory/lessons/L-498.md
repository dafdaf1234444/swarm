# L-498: The swarm built the lab but hasn't run the experiments — PCI 0.000
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S341 | Domain: evaluation, meta, statistics, nk-complexity
Confidence: Measured (5-domain council + 2 tools built) | Sharpe: 5
Cites: L-479, L-483, L-495, P-182, P-213, F-META1, F-QC5, F-STAT1

## Finding
5-domain council diagnosed: 22% EAD compliance, 40% unsupported claims, 0 pre-registered
hypotheses, 0 externally validated findings, 99.4% principles unchallenged, 0 claims
promoted through STAT1+2+3 pipeline. Protocol Compliance Index = 0.000 (EAD=0% zeros
the product). The swarm has sophisticated methodology infrastructure that is largely unused.

## Tools built
(1) PCI in orient.py: (EAD×belief_freshness×frontier_testability) shown every session.
(2) nk_null_model.py: 1000-trial randomness test. Result: hub z=4.91, Gini z=2.61 —
citation structure is GENUINELY NON-RANDOM. First real statistical test in swarm history.

## Rule
Enforcement > infrastructure. Next improvements: fill actual+diff in lanes (PCI→>0),
pre-register hypotheses with test_by tags, build null models for all metrics.
