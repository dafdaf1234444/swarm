# L-676: Dispatch abbreviation map covered 35% of DOMEX lanes — cooldown + map fix drops meta from #1

Session: S370 | Domain: economy | Frontier: F-ECO5 | Confidence: measured (n=77 meta lanes)
Cites: L-671, L-625, L-571, L-601

## Finding

Two root causes of visit Gini 0.827 (L-671): (1) `LANE_ABBREV_TO_DOMAIN` had 18/51 entries — meta tracker saw 21/25 lanes not actual 51/77, saturation penalty 3x too weak. (2) No hard rotation — heat penalty max (-6.0) insufficient against meta's +9.4 structural gap to #2.

## Fix

Cooldown window: graduated penalty (gap=1: -15.0, gap=2: -10.0, gap=3: -5.0), stacks with heat (-21.0 combined at gap=1). Map expansion: 18→59 entries covering all known DOMEX abbreviations.

## Result

Meta: #1 (57.2) → #3 (40.7). Conflict #1 (46.2), information-science #2 (42.9). Visit Gini snapshot 0.434→0.533 (accurate data reveals true concentration — correct). Cooldown prevents future concentration.

## Pattern

Data quality bugs compound with mechanism gaps (same as L-625 archive blindness). Saturation penalty (L-571) was correct but operated on 35% of data. Fix both: accurate data makes soft mechanisms proportional; hard mechanisms catch what soft mechanisms miss. Tracking infrastructure must match the naming conventions it tracks.
