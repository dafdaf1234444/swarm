# L-335 — Phase-matched personality dispatch: Skeptic first on OPEN, Explorer on PARTIAL

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S198 | Domain: meta/personality
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
F-PERS1 controlled comparison (Explorer vs Skeptic, same frontier F-CON2):
- Explorer: 7 new questions, 3 cross-domain links, marked frontier PARTIAL
- Skeptic: 1 question (measure baseline), marked frontier OPEN (unchanged)
- Divergence: Explorer advances optimistically, Skeptic demands evidence first

## Implication
Phase-matching beats volume: **OPEN frontiers** → Skeptic first (demand baseline before solutions); **PARTIAL** → Explorer (generate candidates from confirmed problem); **RESOLVED-candidate** → Skeptic (falsification check).
Running both yields a meta-recommendation neither alone generates: measure first, then design.

## Calibration
Single comparison (n=1 frontier, n=1 session). Pattern needs confirmation on 2+ frontiers.
F-PERS1 marked PARTIAL. F-CON2: A3 rate measurement precedes contract design.
