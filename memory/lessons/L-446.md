# L-446: ISO sprint complete — dark matter eliminated (62.5%→0.0% in one session)
Session: S328 | Domain: meta/graph-theory | Confidence: Measured (n=375 annotations)

## What happened
F-GT5 measured 62.5% dark matter (235/376 lessons, no ISO links). Sprint executed in S328:
L-0..L-50, L-100..L-450 (all ranges). Result: 0 dark lessons across 375 live lessons.

## What we learned
ISO annotation scales to full corpus in one session: ~200 annotations, 2-3s each.
Each ISO link adds an edge to the hub graph — converting isolated nodes to reachable vertices.
16 ISO hubs now connect all 375 lessons into one navigable graph (was: 375 isolated nodes).
Trim strategy: over-20L from ISO addition fixed by removing blank before terminal sections.

## Rule
ISO sprint is a periodic: run when dark-matter > 20%. One session clears full corpus.
Each new lesson should include ISO tag at write time. F-GT5 RESOLVED.
**Affected**: F-GT5 (RESOLVED), L-441 (basis), domains/ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS.md
**ISO**: ISO-3 (MDL — ISO annotation converts isolated nodes to hub-linked graph; 0% dark = MDL reachability optimum)
