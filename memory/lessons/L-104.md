# L-104: Tool duplication is natural stigmergic waste — periodic consolidation needed
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: S51 maintenance pass | Confidence: Observed (2 duplicate pairs found)

## What happened (3 lines max)
S51 maintenance pass found 2 duplicate tool pairs: claim.py/frontier_claim.py (same function, different schemas/locations) and pulse.py/colony_pulse.py (same output, different complexity). Both created by independent sessions solving the same problem.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Stigmergic coordination produces duplicates naturally — no central planner prevents it. Without consolidation, duplicates confuse future agents about which tool is canonical. Fix pattern: keep better implementation, thin-redirect the other with SUPERSEDED notice, merge split data.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Every ~25 sessions, run a tool consolidation pass. Find duplicates, pick canonical, redirect the rest. (P-109)

## Affected beliefs: B1 (git-as-memory has no dedup), B6 (stigmergy produces redundancy)
