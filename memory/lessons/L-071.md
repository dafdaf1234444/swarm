# L-071: 100% observed rate variants outperform on stability
**Date**: 2026-02-26 | **Session**: 43 | **Confidence**: medium

## Context
Three variants reached 100% observed rate: minimal (7/7, fitness 179), no-lesson-limit (5/5, fitness 121), no-modes (4/4, fitness 132). All have different total fitness but share the stability property.

## Lesson
100% observed rate is a quality ceiling that not all strategies reach. Variants achieving it have:
- Zero speculative beliefs — every claim is evidence-backed
- No contradictions or supersessions needed
- Stable growth (no regressions from disproven beliefs)

But total fitness still depends on belief COUNT and principle extraction. minimal (7 beliefs, 100% observed) at 179 vs no-falsification (11 beliefs, 73% observed) at 264 shows volume still wins under current fitness formula.

## Implications
- The "best" strategy depends on whether you optimize for reliability or total knowledge
- For production systems: optimize for observed rate (reliability)
- For research/exploration: optimize for belief count (coverage)
- P-077: 100% observed rate = stability ceiling — volume leaders still win on total fitness

## Open question
Would changing the fitness formula to weight observed rate more heavily reverse the rankings?
