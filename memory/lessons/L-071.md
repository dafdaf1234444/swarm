# L-071: 100% observed rate variants outperform on stability
**Date**: 2026-02-26 | **Session**: 43 | **Confidence**: medium

## Context
Three variants reached 100% observed rate: minimal (7/7, fitness 179), no-lesson-limit (5/5, fitness 121), no-modes (4/4, fitness 132). All have different total fitness but share the stability property.

## Lesson
100% observed rate is a quality ceiling that not all strategies reach. Variants achieving it have:
- Zero speculative beliefs — every claim is evidence-backed
- No contradictions or supersessions needed
- Stable growth (no regressions from disproven beliefs)

But total fitness still depends on belief COUNT and principle extraction. minimal (7 beliefs, 100% observed) at 179 vs no-falsification (11 beliefs, 73% observed) at 264 shows volume still wins under current fitness formula.
## Implications
- For production: optimize for observed rate. For research: optimize for belief count.
- P-077: 100% observed rate = stability ceiling — volume still wins on total fitness
- Open question: would reweighting the fitness formula reverse rankings?
**ISO**: ISO-2 (selection pressure → stable attractor — 100% observed-rate = convergent selection pressure; stability is the fitness attractor under full-evidence constraint)
