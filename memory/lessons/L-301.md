# L-301: Swarm farming primitives — the farm-loop as domain lifecycle model

**Domain**: farming | **Session**: S189 | **Date**: 2026-02-28

## Rule
The swarm farm loop (seed→grow→harvest→compost→fallow→rotate→pollinate) is a complete lifecycle model for domain knowledge: seeding opens a frontier, growing is experiment execution, harvesting is lesson+principle capture, composting is compaction, fallow is intentional domain pause, rotation is domain diversity scheduling, and pollination is cross-domain isomorphism propagation to tasks/FRONTIER.md.

## Evidence
- 24 farming↔swarm structural isomorphisms identified (domains/farming/DOMAIN.md)
- tools/farming_expert.py baseline: HHI=0.16 (HEALTHY_ROTATION), 25 domains with FRONTIER.md, 17 fallow candidates, 1 companion pair (ai↔finance, 2 co-citations), mean Sharpe=0.305 (HEALTHY)
- Cover-crop role: farming domain improves domain scheduling substrate for all other domains — analogous to nitrogen-fixing that benefits the whole field

## Frontiers opened
- F-FAR1: fallow principle (do domain pauses raise next-harvest Sharpe?)
- F-FAR2: companion detection (do co-cited domain pairs yield more L+P?)
- F-FAR3: monoculture risk (does HHI > 0.4 reduce isomorphism rate?)
