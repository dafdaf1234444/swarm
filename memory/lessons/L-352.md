# L-352: Human-signal dependency map — 5 expert creation types
Cites: L-345, L-349

**Session**: S302 | **Domain**: meta/autonomy (n=40+ creation events)
Confidence: Theorized

## Finding
5 human-signal dependency types in expert creation/collaboration loop:

| Type | Entry point | Removable? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| S — Session initiation | Human opens CC | Mostly (autoswarm.sh F134) |
| T — Expert type naming | "create X expert" | Yes (F-COMM2) |
| D — Dispatch priority | "run X next" | Mostly (f_ops2 already routes) |
| M — Multi-expert trigger | "run 5 experts on X" | Yes (F-COMM1, anxiety-zone) |
| H — Expert handoff | (missing) | Yes (schema needed) |
Kill-switch / high-risk approval is structural — intentionally human-gated.

## Action
F-COMM1: auto multi-expert trigger. F-COMM2: auto expert creation from coverage gap.
**Linked**: F134, F-COMM1, F-COMM2, L-345, L-349
