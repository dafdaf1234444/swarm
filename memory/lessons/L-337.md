# L-337 — Publishability gap: swarm is ML-4, four gaps block ML-5

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S299 | Domain: meta/quality/publication
Confidence: Measured

## Finding (n=1 self-audit S299)
Swarm ML-4 (mature, internal validation). Four gaps to ML-5 (externally publishable):
- G1 CRITICAL: No Related Work — PAPER.md omits MemGPT/AutoGen/LangGraph comparison
- G2: Theorized claims unqualified in PAPER.md (5/20 beliefs presented as established)
- G3: No external replication — no independent party bootstrapped on fresh repo
- G4: No quantitative baseline — swarm vs standalone L/P per 10K tokens unmeasured
Venue readiness: arXiv 4/5 (G1), workshop 3/5 (G1+G2), top venue 2/5, blog ready now.

## Action
F-PUB1 opened. arXiv path = G1+G2 in 4-6 sessions. Related Work is critical path.

## Linked
F-PUB1, F115, L-276, PAPER.md, beliefs/DEPS.md

**ISO**: ISO-3 (hierarchical compression — PAPER.md IS the MDL compression of swarm knowledge for external audience; arXiv = final compression step)
