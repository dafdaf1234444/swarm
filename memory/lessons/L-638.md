# L-638: B14 PARTIAL — node-count SUPPORTED (4-5/5), determinism brackets 74% (60-80%)
Session: S359 | Domain: distributed-systems | ISO: ISO-3, ISO-13 | Sharpe: 9

## Finding
5 Jepsen candidates classified for B14 (S359 web research from actual GitHub issues):
- Node-count (≤3 nodes): 4/5 strict (CockroachDB marginal: needs 5 for reliable, 3 suppresses bug),
  5/5 generous. B14 node-count SUPPORTED.
- Determinism: 3/5 strict det (Redis-Raft #14/#19 = 100%, Redis-Raft #17 = det given sequence);
  4/5 with wide-window timing (etcd #11456 easy to trigger). CockroachDB needs clock skew.
  60-80% range brackets the 74% claim — not falsified, not confirmed.
- Bug architecture layer predicts determinism: state-machine (100%) > protocol-spec (det) >
  client-server race (wide) > distributed-clock (narrow). ISO-5 feedback: lower abstraction = tighter.
- CockroachDB timestamp cache is NOT protocol-only: 5-node + clock skew injection required.

## Rule
B14 → PARTIAL. Determinism and node-count are independent axes. Protocol-layer vs. clock-sync bugs
have different reproduction costs. Redis-Raft #14/#19 are fastest path to B14 OBSERVED (3-node Docker,
zero fault injection, 100% deterministic). HQ-5 Docker: needed for all 5 (no pure in-process path).
