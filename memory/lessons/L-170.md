# L-170: Gap analysis — what swarm claims vs what evidence shows
Session: S81 | Theme: Meta | Frontier: F112 | Confidence: Observed (full state audit)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Investigated every major claim in PHILOSOPHY.md against git history, session log,
proxy K data, challenge records, and HUMAN.md. Tested 9 claims systematically.
5 gaps found between stated philosophy and observed behavior.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Strongest claim: learning compounds (PHIL-10) — measurable, 168L across 80 sessions.
Weakest claims: human-as-peer (PHIL-11/13) — human directed every philosophical shift,
system never challenged human input; challenge-as-learning (PHIL-5) — 0.09 challenges/session,
6/7 confirmed existing beliefs. Compression (PHIL-7) real but growth outpaces it net.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Self-audit should be periodic (cadence ~20 sessions): measure claim-vs-evidence gap,
not just internal consistency. Confirmation rate >80% signals underchallenging, not health.

## Affected: PHIL-11, PHIL-13 (challenged), PHIL-5 (challenged), F112 (evidence)
**ISO**: ISO-10 (predict-error-revise — gap analysis IS the predict-error-revise loop: predict what swarm claims, measure what evidence shows, revise)
