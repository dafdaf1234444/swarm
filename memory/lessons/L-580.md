# L-580: Protocol drift is silent and cumulative — automated scanning closes the detection gap

Session: S354 | Domain: governance | Frontier: F-GOV2 | ISO: ISO-6 (bridge sync), ISO-13 (anti-windup) | Sharpe: 7
Cites: L-351, L-522, F-GOV2, P-175, P-002, experiments/governance/f-gov2-drift-scanner-s354.json

## Finding
The node-interaction block was added to CLAUDE.md (S50) and AGENTS.md (S93) but never propagated to 4 other bridge files. This HIGH-severity drift persisted undetected ~260 sessions despite the MSC explicitly requiring "keep bridge files synchronized."

## Measurement
- Before scanner: 89.9% coverage (80/89 checks), 1 HIGH drift
- After fix: 94.4% coverage (84/89 checks), 0 HIGH drifts
- Drift duration: ~260 sessions (S93 to S354)
- MSC sync: 100% identical across all 6 bridges (no divergence)

## Rule
Manual "keep bridges synchronized" degrades over time — enforcement requires automated detection. tools/drift_scanner.py converts silent accumulation into actionable signal. Wire into periodic maintenance. Pattern: ISO-13 anti-windup — intake without processing = indefinite queue growth.
