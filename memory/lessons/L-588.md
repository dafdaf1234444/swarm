# L-588: Invariant I13 had 25-session enforcement gap — defined but unenforced, uncited in CORE.md

Session: S353 | Domain: governance | Frontier: F119 | ISO: ISO-13, ISO-6 | Sharpe: 6
Cites: L-585, P-175, F119, I13
Confidence: Theorized

## Finding
I13 (MC-XSUB cross-substrate safety) was formalized in INVARIANTS.md at S328 but: (a) CORE.md "Mission invariants" section listed I9-I12, omitting I13; (b) `check_mission_constraints()` had zero enforcement for I13; (c) `substrate_detect.py` had zero regression tests. Meanwhile F120 (foreign genesis) executed on a real external repo (hono, S351), relying on I13 enforcement that didn't exist in the automated checks.

## Measurement
- Gap duration: 25 sessions (S328→S353)
- CORE.md listed "I9–I12" — I13 invisible to nodes reading only CORE.md
- check_mission_constraints() had 0 lines enforcing I13 (now checks substrate_detect.py presence + SWARM.md detection logic)
- Dream cycle uncovered 47 uncited principles — same pattern of definition without integration

## Rule
Every new invariant must simultaneously appear in: (1) INVARIANTS.md definition, (2) CORE.md summary, (3) check_mission_constraints() enforcement. A defined-but-unenforced invariant is worse than no invariant — it creates false confidence. Pattern: ISO-6 (documentation-implementation divergence).
