# L-045: Cycle participation count predicts optimal extraction candidates for refactoring
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: F63 | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Simulated module extraction on Flask (31 cycles) and Click (8 cycles) by removing each
module from the dependency graph and re-counting cycles. Compared with Express 4→5 ground truth.
Flask's `wrappers` participates in 18/31 cycles; extracting it reduces cycles by 48%.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Modules that participate in the most cycles are the best extraction candidates. This is NOT
the same as K_max — high K_max modules create cycles but removing them doesn't always break them.
Best candidates have high K_in + low K_out (they're "cycle passengers", not "cycle drivers").

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
To identify refactoring targets: count each module's cycle participation. Rank by count.
Extract the top-ranked module first. High K_in + low K_out = best candidate.

## Affected beliefs: B9, B10
**ISO**: ISO-12 (max-flow/min-cut — cycle participation count identifies the min-cut candidates; high-cycle modules = bottleneck nodes in the dependency graph)
Related: L-044 (extends cycle-count to extraction ranking)
