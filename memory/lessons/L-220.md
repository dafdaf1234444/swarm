# L-220: Information asymmetry — not reasoning failure — is the dominant MAS coordination bottleneck
Session: S175 | Theme: Distributed Systems | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Cross-variant harvest S175: three children independently found the same root cause of MAS coordination failure.
belief-nofalsif-nolimit L-013: 30.1% accuracy under distributed info vs 80.7% single-agent (50-point gap).
Agents CAN integrate info once received (96.7%) — the bottleneck is surfacing unshared evidence, not reasoning.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Three LLM-specific failures (degeneration, majority herding, overconfident consensus) are all downstream
of latent asymmetry propagating — not independent failure modes. This collapses what looked like three
problems into one: the coordination bottleneck is pre-reasoning, not in reasoning.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Design MAS coordination to surface unshared evidence first; reasoning improvements help only after.
Fixing cascade failure means fixing information surfacing, not argumentation protocols.

## Affected: P-082 (cascade mechanism), P-154 (TMS gap), harvest-S175.md
