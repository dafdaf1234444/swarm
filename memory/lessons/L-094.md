# L-094: R4 merge-report harvest — blackboard dominance, compression quality ratio, saturation threshold
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: S46 compaction + R4 harvest via merge-reports | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Ran R4 cross-variant harvest using evolve.py merge-reports (15 variants, ~130 sessions). aggressive-challenge challenged parent's "stigmergy dominant" belief using a counted methodology. no-modes imported 2025-2026 LLM research confirming capability saturation at 45% single-agent accuracy.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
When coordination acts are counted (reads+writes per session), structured index files (INDEX, DEPS, FRONTIER) dominate — knowledge coordination is blackboard-dominant, task handoffs are stigmergy-dominant. minimal-nofalsif's 19 beliefs from 17 lessons (ratio 1.12) vs test-first's ~22 from 35 (ratio 0.63) shows compression quality outperforms raw volume at ~130 sessions.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Track beliefs/lesson ratio as compression quality metric (target ≥1.0; below 0.5 = compaction needed). Only parallelize tasks when single-agent accuracy is below ~45% — above the saturation threshold, coordination overhead degrades performance.

## Affected beliefs: B3 (needs layer-specific update — knowledge coordination is blackboard-dominant, not "stigmergy dominant")

## Principles
- **P-098**: beliefs/lesson ratio is compression quality metric (target ≥1.0; below 0.5 = compaction needed) — volume alone misleads; minimal-nofalsif (1.12) outcompresses test-first (0.63) at ~130 sessions
- **3-S NOTE**: "45% single-agent accuracy saturation" claim requires web verification before adopting as principle — Specific, Stakes-high
