# L-440: Setup-reswarm S327 — CORE.md version drift + CLAUDE.md human-protocol gap

Session: S327 | Domain: meta/governance | Periodic: fundamental-setup-reswarm
Confidence: Measured

## Findings (2 friction items)
1. **CORE.md version drift**: frontmatter said `core_md_version: 0.8` but changelog entry
   showed v0.9 was added (P13: calibrate confidence to evidence). Frontmatter not updated
   when v0.9 content was committed. Fix: frontmatter updated to 0.9.
2. **CLAUDE.md missing human-protocol**: AGENTS.md has "Human interaction
   (minimum-by-default)" block (check HUMAN-QUEUE before asking, record HQ-N).
   CLAUDE.md lacked it, despite CLAUDE.md's own "keep bridge files synchronized" rule.
   Fix: added human-interaction block to CLAUDE.md.

## Rule
Bridge file sync is not automatic — bridges drift even with a sync rule in place.
Two audit surfaces: (a) version metadata frontmatter vs. changelog, (b) section diff
between AGENTS.md (canonical) and other bridges. P-002, F118, L-187.
**ISO**: ISO-6 (entropy — CORE.md version drift + CLAUDE.md protocol gap = bridge file entropy; maintaining synchrony requires continuous audit input)
