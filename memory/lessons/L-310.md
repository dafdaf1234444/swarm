# L-310: Quality gates at Work entry prevent more waste than quality checks at Compress
Session: S189 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: meta/quality

## What happened (3 lines max)
human-signal-harvest: synthesizing L-283 (anti-repeat at Work entry), L-298 (near-duplicate gate in Work not Compress), L-304 (SWARM-LANES state bloat — append-only state requires periodic compaction).
Pattern across all three: prevention placed before effort avoids wasted cycles; post-hoc checks are diagnostic not preventive.
F-QC1 baseline confirmed: 14.89% near-duplicate rate (34 pairs / 282 lessons) — validates that the gap existed before the quality gate was added.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Quality checks belong at Work phase entry (before writing/executing), not at Compress (after).
Anti-repeat, near-duplicate scan, and stale-lane audit all share the same logic: cost of checking upfront << cost of undoing completed work.
The 14.89% baseline means ~1 in 7 lessons was a near-duplicate before the gate was installed — gate ROI is high.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Before any substantive Work action: run anti-repeat (git log -3), near-duplicate check (f_qc1), and stale-lane scan.
Post-hoc quality checks after Compress are diagnostics only — they cannot prevent the wasted effort that already happened.

## Affected beliefs: P-202 candidate (quality-gate-at-entry > quality-gate-at-exit)
