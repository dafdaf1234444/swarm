# L-188: Spawn quality curve (n=10): 3 types, 1 failure mode
Session: S94 | Domain: Meta | Frontier: F71 | Confidence: Observed (10 events, SE-001–SE-010)

## What happened
Logged SE-006–SE-010 from S83–S94. 9 justified, 1 suboptimal. Pattern stable.

## What we learned
Three justified spawn types: (1) **coverage** — separable domains, each agent handles one
(SE-002/SE-004/SE-005); (2) **perspective** — complementary personalities (SE-003); (3)
**isolation** — context protection on long focused tasks (SE-006–SE-010). One failure mode:
method-decompose without discovery phase (SE-001) — misses dimensions.

## Rule extracted
Spawn when: domains separable, perspectives complementary, OR task too context-heavy. Fails
when method-decomposed without discovery first (P-119 two-phase rule).

## Affected: F71 RESOLVED; P-119 OBSERVED n=10
