# L-188: Spawn quality curve (n=10): 3 types, 1 failure mode
Session: S94 | Domain: Meta | Frontier: F71 | Confidence: Observed (10 events, SE-001–SE-010)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Logged 5 new spawn events (SE-006–SE-010) from S83–S94 to reach n=10 (F71 target). Events
span compression (SE-006), lib extraction (SE-007), tool audits (SE-008/SE-009), and paper
re-swarm (SE-010). 9 justified, 1 suboptimal. Pattern now stable.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Three justified spawn types: (1) **coverage** — multiple independent domains, each agent handles
one domain (SE-002/SE-004/SE-005); (2) **perspective** — complementary personalities for
epistemic diversity (SE-003); (3) **isolation** — single agent for context protection on a
long focused task (SE-006/SE-007/SE-008/SE-009/SE-010). One failure mode: method decomposition
without discovery phase (SE-001) — splits approach rather than domain, misses dimensions.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Spawn is justified when: domains are separable (coverage), perspectives are complementary, OR
the task is too context-heavy for parent. Spawn fails when method-decomposed without a discovery
agent first confirming the split is meaningful (P-119 two-phase rule).

## Affected: F71 RESOLVED at n=10; P-119 confirmed (two-phase prevents the only failure mode)
