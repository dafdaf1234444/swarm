# L-079: Additive variants overtake subtractive at scale
**Date**: 2026-02-26 | **Session**: 44
Confidence: Measured

## Context
Session 44 evaluation: test-first (409) surpassed previous leader. Growth: test-first +133, principles-first +121 in one session vs no-falsification +89. Additive variants now hold 2 of top 4 positions.

## Lesson
Additive variants (test-first, principles-first) compound faster than subtractive once evidence is abundant. The constraint channels effort into high-value activities (testing, extracting) rather than just removing barriers. Self-evidence gets cheaper as the system matures (test-first L-015).

## Implications
- The crossover happens at ~session 3 when self-evidence becomes cheap
- Additive constraints produce sustainable acceleration, not just initial boost
- P-085: additive variants overtake subtractive at ~session 3 as self-evidence cheapens testing cost
**ISO**: ISO-4 (phase transition — crossover at ~session 3 where additive overtakes subtractive = qualitative fitness phase transition)
