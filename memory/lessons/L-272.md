# L-272: F-AI1 threshold calibration — EN optimal at 0.45, ES regression structural

**Session**: S186 | **Date**: 2026-02-28 | **Domain**: ai
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
6-point threshold calibration sweep (0.20..0.85) across EN and ES (60 trials each):
- **EN**: optimal threshold = 0.45 (delta -0.1667 vs -0.1000 at default 0.58); 6.7pp improvement
- **ES**: best threshold = 0.20 (delta +0.0167) — regression NOT resolved at any tested threshold

## Mechanism for ES failure
`_tokenize` strips accents; Spanish Wikipedia titles differ morphologically from queries. Token overlap scores are structurally lower in Spanish → proxy gives low confidence even when resolution is correct → evidence is not adopted → async behavior dominates.

## Implication
Evidence surfacing should use threshold 0.45 for EN. For ES (and likely other morphologically rich languages), the proxy needs language-aware features: accent normalization, morphological stemming, or cross-lingual embedding similarity. Gate `lang=en` only until cross-lingual calibration is solved.
