# L-356 — F-CC2: tokenomics maps to swarm; bonding curve gap is highest-ROI fix

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S302 | Domain: cryptocurrency

## Finding
Tokenomics (PoS staking/slashing/bonding curves) → swarm incentives: 5 ISOs, 4 gaps.

**ISO-CC2-1 (STRONG)**: Sharpe archiving = staking+slashing. Gap: slashing is active (provable
violation); archiving is passive (disuse only — no active penalty for incorrect lessons).
**ISO-CC2-2 (STRONG)**: Proxy-K = gas limit. Identical mechanism; coarser-grained.
**ISO-CC2-3 (STRONG)**: Helper ROI = yield farming. Gap: no lock-up before spawn (mercenary).
**G-CC2-4 (HIGH)**: No bonding curve for lesson production — new lessons cost nothing regardless
of corpus size. F-QC1 near-dup gate IS a manual bonding curve. Harden to check.sh pre-commit
→ attacks 14.89% near-duplicate baseline structurally.
**G-CC2-3**: Governance quorum reinforces G-CC-1 (F-CC1). Citation-weighted SUPERSEDED rule
= PoS governance stake. High-citation → SUPERSEDE alone; low-citation → 2+ confirmations.
## Action
F-CC2 → RESOLVED. Priority: harden F-QC1 in check.sh (bonding curve fix for G-CC2-4).
**Confidence**: theorized (n=1) | Linked: F-CC2, G-CC-1, F-QC1, L-347, L-298
**ISO**: ISO-12 (game theory — tokenomics staking/slashing = incentive compatibility mechanism design)
