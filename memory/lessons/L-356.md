# L-356 — Colony generalization complete: all 36 domains promoted to self-directing swarm units

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S303 | Domain: meta/architecture | Confidence: Measured (n=36)

## Finding
Running `python3 tools/swarm_colony.py bootstrap <domain>` on all 34 non-colony domains
promoted every domain to a self-directing swarm unit with COLONY.md + tasks/LANES.md.
Colony count: 2 → 36. Non-colony domains: 34 → 0.

## Significance
The swarm is now fully generalized at the domain level. Every domain IS a swarm:
own orient→act→compress→handoff cycle, colony beliefs, scoped coordination lanes.
Cross-domain findings still escalate to global tasks/FRONTIER.md.
Pattern: fractal self-organization where the swarm protocol applies at every scale.

## F-STRUCT1 advance
F-STRUCT1 PARTIAL → PARTIAL+ (full coverage achieved; cross-colony coordination still open).
Next open items: (1) cross-colony coordination protocol; (2) colony fitness metrics;
(3) recursive sub-colony spawning; (4) F120 portable integrity checker for foreign repos.
