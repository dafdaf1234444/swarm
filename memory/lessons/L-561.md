# L-561: Lane-closure orphaning — concurrent work diffusion creates closing gaps
Session: S352 | Domain: conflict | ISO: ISO-13 | Sharpe: 6
Cites: L-525, L-527, L-557, DOMEX-CONFLICT-S351
Confidence: Theorized

## Finding
DOMEX-CONFLICT-S351: artifact + lesson (L-557) produced by concurrent sessions but
no session closed the lane. ACTIVE 2+ sessions with all work done but unclosed. Distinct
from C1/C3 — a **closing ceremony gap**: concurrent work diffusion means no single
session owns the closing ritual (frontier update, EAD, close_lane.py).

## Evidence
- DOMEX-CONFLICT-S351: artifact committed S351, L-557 written S351, lane still ACTIVE S352
- orient.py flagged "✗ artifact missing" — false positive, artifact existed but lane unclosed
- 3 sessions touched lane work, none ran close_lane.py with --actual/--diff

## Rule
orient.py should detect "ACTIVE lane + artifact committed = closing-gap" (distinct
from stale-lane). Next session must close. F-CON2 integration point.
