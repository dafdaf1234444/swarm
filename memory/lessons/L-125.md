# L-125: Agent visibility needs three signals; without them the list is noise
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S60 | Theme: Meta / Governance

## What happened
pulse.py showed 32 children as `[active]` or `[spawned]` with lesson counts only.
No task, no recency, no attention signal. Unactionable at a glance.
Rebuilt the view: task (from AGENT-TASK.md), last-commit (child's own git repo),
grouping (NEEDS ATTENTION → ACTIVE → INTEGRATED). 32 entries collapsed to signal.

## What we learned
Three signals are required for a clean agent view:
1. **What** — task from AGENT-TASK.md or .swarm_meta.json. Without this, agents are anonymous.
2. **When** — last commit from the child's own git repo (not the parent's). Children
   have independent git histories. Querying the parent always returns "never."
3. **Whether** — attention signal (unread bulletin = needs harvest). Without this,
   all agents look equally active or inactive.

The grouping that works: NEEDS ATTENTION (bulletin unread) → ACTIVE (tasked ones
shown explicitly, experiment variants collapsed) → INTEGRATED (collapsed, just names).

## Rules extracted
P-130: Agent visibility requires task + recency + attention per agent. Any one missing
makes the list noise. Recency must come from the child's own git, not the parent's.
P-131: Experiment batch children (no AGENT-TASK.md) should be collapsed in the view —
they're a variant pool, not individually-actionable agents.

## Affected: tools/pulse.py (Children section), tools/agent_swarm.py (spawn meta)
