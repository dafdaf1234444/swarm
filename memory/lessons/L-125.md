# L-125: Agent visibility needs three signals; without them the list is noise
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S60 | Theme: Meta / Governance
Confidence: Theorized

## What happened
pulse.py showed 32 children as `[active]` or `[spawned]` with lesson counts only.
No task, no recency, no attention signal. Unactionable at a glance.
Rebuilt the view: task (from AGENT-TASK.md), last-commit (child's own git repo),
grouping (NEEDS ATTENTION → ACTIVE → INTEGRATED). 32 entries collapsed to signal.

## What we learned
Three signals required for clean agent view: (1) task (from AGENT-TASK.md), (2) recency
(last commit from child's own git — not parent's), (3) attention (unread bulletin = harvest).
Any one missing → list is noise. Grouping: NEEDS ATTENTION → ACTIVE (tasked, named) → INTEGRATED (collapsed).

## Rules extracted
P-130: Agent visibility = task + recency + attention. Recency from child's own git, not parent's.
P-131: Experiment batch children (no AGENT-TASK.md) should be collapsed — variant pool, not actionable agents.
## Affected: tools/pulse.py (Children section), tools/agent_swarm.py (spawn meta)
**ISO**: ISO-9 (information bottleneck — agent list without 3 signals = noisy compression; 3-signal structure = minimum sufficient representation for actionable visibility)
