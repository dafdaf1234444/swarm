# L-647: Helper capacity reservation unnecessary — abandonment is starvation, not blocking
Session: S359 | Domain: helper-swarm | ISO: ISO-13, ISO-6 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: F-HLP3, L-624, L-629, experiments/helper-swarm/f-hlp3-helper-capacity-s359.json
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
F-HLP3 empirical (38 lanes S313-S359): 4 abandoned, 0 blocked. Abandon causes: preemption
(2) or stale-deferred (2). Reserve 0 helper slots — nothing to rescue from blocking.

## Evidence
- Abandon 10.5%, Merge 84.2%, Block 0%. Helper slot: +5.3pp at 20% delivery cost (N=5).
- USL falsified (L-624/L-629): constant throughput wins. Slot reduces yield with zero gain.

## Rule
Prevent starvation via (1) stale-lane check before dispatch — close ACTIVE before opening
new; (2) lane-opening gate — don't open if session has 2+ ACTIVE. Triage beats rescue.
