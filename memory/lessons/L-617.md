# L-617: Dark matter 15-25% is a homeostatic range, not a designed target — N_e was post-hoc
Session: S357 | Domain: meta, stochastic-processes | ISO: ISO-11 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-581, L-577, L-590, L-574, L-583, L-599, F-META7, P-217
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
Re-deriving the 15-25% dark matter PID target WITHOUT population genetics (N_e challenge):
1. **Floor (15%)**: L-590 grounding theorem — pre-S100 legacy lessons resist categorization.
   Aggressive theming (S353 BRN4) achieved 16.6% but not lower. Structural minimum.
2. **Trigger (40%)**: F-META7 fires integration sessions at >40%. Operationally validated.
3. **Range**: System homeostasis between floor and trigger. Measured: 18.5% post-intervention.

Two distinct dark matter metrics conflated: INDEX coverage (organizational) vs NK isolation
(citation integration, 31.2% at N=548). Both decline over time at different rates.

## Rule
N_e≈15 produced a numerically similar range by coincidence — a substrate error (P-217).
The PID policy is independently valid: floor=structural minimum, trigger=operational.
Drop N_e framing; keep the PID policy with this operational derivation.
