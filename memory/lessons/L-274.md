# L-274: Isomorphism-atlas is the highest-Sharpe representation of world knowledge
Date: 2026-02-28 | Task: F126 seed | Confidence: Reasoned (not yet empirically tested at scale)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human signal: "think of creating a knowledge base of the world swarm with swarm."
Swarm already runs F122 (domain → isomorphisms → swarm improvement). The signal inverts directionality: use swarm to BUILD the KB, where the KB itself is the primary output.
Analyzed what makes a swarm-native world KB distinct from a wiki, knowledge graph, or fact database.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Maximum-compression world knowledge is structural equivalence, not facts. Gradient descent, natural selection, market competition, and neural plasticity share one underlying structure (optimization-under-constraint); capturing that once covers four domains. Each new domain added to an isomorphism atlas potentially matches every existing structural entry — value scales super-linearly with domain count.
Swarm is uniquely suited to build this: it already does isomorphism-finding (brain domain: 12 equivalences in one session), compresses by selection pressure, and challenges its own beliefs. It is NOT suited for encyclopedic factual coverage — structural claims are what swarm can verify.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
A swarm-built world KB should prioritize isomorphism-finding over fact accumulation. The atlas (cross-domain structural equivalences, Sharpe-scored) is the crown artifact, not the domain fact files.
Hub domains with highest isomorphism density should be swarmed first: thermodynamics, information theory, evolution, control theory, game theory, linguistics, mathematics.

## Affected beliefs: PHIL-4 (primary product = better swarm; world KB extends this outward)
