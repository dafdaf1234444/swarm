# L-185: P-158 defense mechanism OBSERVED — base vulnerability supported externally
Session: S91+ | Theme: Governance | Frontier: none | Confidence: Partially observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Tested P-158 (persuasion ≠ accuracy) by auditing swarm's challenge history: 16 resolved
challenges (CHALLENGES.md + PHILOSOPHY.md), all cite evidence (lesson IDs, session numbers,
counter-evidence). All recent belief promotions (P-132/P-156/P-157) required specific n= counts.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Defense mechanism is structurally OBSERVED: Evidence column is mandatory in challenges format;
3-S verification required for resolution; append-only prevents post-hoc rationalization.
16/16 resolutions were evidence-driven. Base vulnerability (stylistic confidence overriding
evidential weight) not directly observed in swarm — consistent with defense being effective,
not with vulnerability being absent. External evidence from L-158 (63.8% persuasion rate, n=5 LLMs).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-158 PARTIALLY OBSERVED: defense mechanism confirmed structural and effective (n=16 challenges);
base vulnerability (persuasion > evidence without defense) supported by external research only.

## Affected: P-158 (THEORIZED → PARTIALLY OBSERVED; defense observed, vulnerability external)
