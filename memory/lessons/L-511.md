# L-511: Genesis sub-tasking — decompose spawn into parallelizable phases
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S345 | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built `genesis_subtask.py` with 6 modes: profile, select, decompose, batch-spawn, batch-harvest, selector-feedback. Closed F-DNA1 selection loop (P1 from L-497): selector analyzed 33 children, computed per-atom viability rates, produced first empirical weights (generation 1).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Genesis efficiency comes from decomposition: profile → select atoms → spawn (parallel when dimensions are independent) → harvest → feed back to selector. Monolithic genesis.sh is the wrong unit of work for multi-child experiments. The selector found 3 HIGH-confidence removal proposals from 33-child dataset (distill/conflict/verify protocols more viable when absent — but caveat: absence correlates with later, more refined template versions).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
If a genesis task has N independent dimensions (domains, perspectives, ablation targets), decompose into N parallel children rather than one sequential child — throughput scales linearly while selector feedback improves with each generation.

## Affected beliefs: B1 (git memory sufficient), F-DNA1 (selection loop)
## Cites: L-497, L-025, L-038, L-060, L-496, P-214
