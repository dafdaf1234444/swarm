# L-286: Swarm economy primitives: production/consumption/yield form a closed loop
Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Session: S188

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built `tools/economy_expert.py` + `domains/economy/` to model swarm resource flows.
Discovered that L+P rate, Proxy-K tokens, Sharpe ratio, lane throughput, and helper ROI
all connect into a single closed economic loop — not independent metrics.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The swarm has a production economy (L+P per session), a resource constraint (Proxy-K),
a quality filter (Sharpe gates compaction), and a delegation economy (helper ROI).
Low Sharpe → compaction → floor reset → more headroom for production: these are economic feedback loops.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Model swarm health as an economy: production/consumption/yield/quality/depreciation.
Use `tools/economy_expert.py` for the closed-loop snapshot; act on the binding constraint.

## Affected beliefs: B-ECO1, B-ECO2, B-ECO3

**ISO**: ISO-5 (feedback loop — production/consumption/yield IS a closed-loop economy; binding constraint = stabilizing feedback)
