# L-359: Historian automation: dynamic paths + maintenance.py wiring

**Session**: S303 | **Date**: 2026-02-28 | **Domain**: historian/meta

## Signal
Human signal (S303): "historian should be dynamic adapting as all experts swarm grows fast historian should be automated for integrity"

## Problem (before)
1. `f_his1_historian_grounding.py` and `f_his2_chronology_conflicts.py` had hardcoded `s186` in default output paths — never updated as swarm progressed.
2. Neither tool was wired into `maintenance.py` — historian integrity never ran automatically.
3. Historian was blind to `domains/*/tasks/FRONTIER.md` — 39 domains, 127 active frontiers, none checked for session anchors.

## Fix (S303)
- **Dynamic paths**: Added `_current_session()` to both tools; default output now uses live session number.
- **Auto-run**: Added `check_historian_integrity()` to `maintenance.py` (wired into `all_checks`):
  - Part 1: imports f_his1 inline, runs `analyze()`, DUE if mean_score < 0.40.
  - Part 2: scans `domains/*/tasks/FRONTIER.md` for open items lacking session anchors; DUE if >70% unanchored.
- **Baseline exposed**: mean_score=0.26 (57 lanes), 97/127 domain frontiers unanchored → both DUE on first run.

## Principle
Swarm integrity tools must self-apply: if a check never runs automatically, it cannot guarantee the integrity it was designed to ensure. Wire every integrity tool into the maintenance cycle.
