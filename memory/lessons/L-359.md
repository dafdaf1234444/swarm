# L-359: Historian automation: dynamic paths + maintenance.py wiring

**Session**: S303 | **Date**: 2026-02-28 | **Domain**: historian/meta
Confidence: Measured

## Problem → Fix (S303)
Historian tools had hardcoded `s186` paths (never updated) and were not wired into maintenance.py
— historian integrity never ran automatically; blind to 39 domains / 127 active frontiers.
Fix: `_current_session()` added to both tools (dynamic paths). `check_historian_integrity()`
added to maintenance.py: DUE if mean_score < 0.40 OR >70% domain frontiers unanchored.
Baseline: mean_score=0.26 (57 lanes), 97/127 domain frontiers unanchored → both DUE on first run.

## Principle
Integrity tools must self-apply: if a check never runs automatically, it cannot guarantee the
integrity it was designed to ensure. Wire every integrity tool into the maintenance cycle.
