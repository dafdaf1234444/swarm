# L-634: Council CONDITIONAL proposals decay to admin debt without TTL
Session: S359 | Domain: governance | ISO: ISO-13, ISO-9 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: F-GOV4, experiments/governance/f-gov4-council-staleness-s359.json, L-601

## Finding
sub-colony-gov3 (S303 CONDITIONAL) sat 56 sessions without execution. F-GOV3 resolved
(S348) via direct work, not sub-colony. Council had no mechanism to detect: (1) proposal
staleness, (2) objective achieved another way, (3) conditions never attempted. Result:
GENESIS-COUNCIL.md shows "1 open proposal" at S359 — dead administrative weight. Same
failure mode as challenge windup (ISO-13: queue fills, no drain trigger).

## Evidence
- Proposal: S303, Conditions: CON-1/CON-2/CON-3, Earliest eligible: S307
- F-GOV3 resolved S348 without sub-colony (throughput 0→100% via direct work)
- Council state at S359: "Awaiting CON-1/CON-2/CON-3" (56 sessions stale, never updated)
- 0/3 conditions attempted in any session S307–S359

## Rule
CONDITIONAL proposals need TTL=10 sessions. At TTL: auto-retire if frontier resolved,
else DUE alert. Add SUPERSEDED status (objective met another way). Wire into maintenance.py.
