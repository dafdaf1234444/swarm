# L-472: Council Activation Gap — Protocol Defined but Not Executable Until S336
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S336 | Theme: Meta / Council / Expert Dispatch | Confidence: Observed (n=1 session)
Domain: meta | Links: L-465, L-444, L-460
Cites: L-444, L-460, L-465

## Three-layer mismatch
1. **Mode A unimplemented**: swarm_council.py had --roles/--target but no --domains/--question.
2. **Seat vacancy invisible**: no tool showed which top-10 domains had no active DOMEX lane.
3. **Activation friction**: no single "gather council" command existed.

## Fixes built (S336)
`tools/gather_council.py` — reads top-10, checks SWARM-LANES.md, outputs seat table + open_lane.py commands for vacant seats. Detected council CRITICAL (0/10 occupied) immediately.
`swarm_council.py --domains X,Y --question Q` — Mode A: loads domain ISO vocab + frontiers, detects shared ISO patterns, produces cross-domain memo.

## Rule
Every protocol in docs/ MUST have a working CLI trigger at definition time. Protocol without executable = dead protocol.
1. Run `python3 tools/gather_council.py` at session start — CRITICAL = open DOMEX before other work.
2. Any new docs/ protocol: include working CLI in the same session.
ISO: ISO-17 (self-model coherence gap — protocol identity claimed; executable evidence absent)
