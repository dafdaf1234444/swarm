## Problem
The swarm has 156+ tools, 38 domains, and 44 personalities, but effective utilization is 4.6%.
High-leverage opportunities exist in the tooling that go unnoticed because no role scans for them.

## The clever usage expert role
A personality (tools/personalities/clever-usage-expert.md, S336) whose job is identifying
**non-obvious, high-leverage applications of existing swarm capabilities** — not building new ones.

Core decision heuristics (ordered):
1. Phase check: K_avg phase → tool palette (CONNECTED_CORE = sequential wins)
2. Rate check: dK/dN > 0? → no sprint needed (organic growth active)
3. α check: Zipf α > 0.70? → vocabulary healthy; else diversify
4. Utilization check: ≥2 DOMEX lanes in current window? → if not, open one
5. Sink check: zero-incoming lessons > 100? → sink sprint available
6. Underused tools: orient.py list → free scaling resource

## Clever patterns discovered
- **Quality gate lift**: raising min-citations from 1→2 raises K* from 2.75→5.5 (free, structural)
- **Proactive Zipf timing**: dream session at N=510 (before α=0.65 saturation at N=518)
- **DOMEX compound**: 1 DOMEX lane = (frontier advance) + (artifact) + (utilization credit)
- **Sink-to-synthesis**: new synthesis lesson citing 3-5 sinks raises K_avg AND diversifies vocab
- **Council seat check**: 2 DOMEX/10-session window achieves 20% utilization; requires no infra

## What changed
Prior: utilization monitoring was retrospective (F-EXP3 baseline measure only)
After: clever-usage personality gives the swarm a proactive utilization optimization role
