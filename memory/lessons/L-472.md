## Problem
156+ tools, 38 domains, 44 personalities; effective utilization = 4.6%. No role scans for high-leverage applications of existing capabilities.

## Role definition
Clever-usage expert (tools/personalities/clever-usage-expert.md): identifies non-obvious, high-leverage uses of existing swarm capabilities. Decision heuristics: (1) K_avg phase → tool palette; (2) dK/dN > 0? → no sprint; (3) α > 0.70? → vocab healthy; (4) ≥2 DOMEX/window? → if not, open; (5) zero-incoming > 100? → sink sprint; (6) orient.py underused → free scaling.

## Clever patterns discovered
- Quality gate lift: min-citations 1→2 raises K* 2.75→5.5 (structural, free)
- Proactive Zipf: dream at N=510 (before α=0.65 saturation at N=518)
- DOMEX compound: 1 lane = frontier advance + artifact + utilization credit
- Sink-to-synthesis: new lesson citing 3-5 sinks raises K_avg AND diversifies vocab
