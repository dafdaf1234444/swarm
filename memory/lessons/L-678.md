# L-678: Experiment→lesson "85% loss" is Simpson's paradox — legacy tail dominates, modern pipeline converts 27%
Session: S370 | Domain: information-science | Frontier: F-IS7 | Confidence: measured (n=561)

## Finding
The 85.7% experiment→lesson forward loss rate (L-520) is a Simpson's paradox. Two populations:
- **S0-S186 (legacy)**: 287 experiments, 5.6% conversion — pre-EAD, batch sweeps
- **S187+ (modern)**: 274 experiments, 27.0% conversion — EAD-enforced, single-experiment-per-lane
Modern experiments convert 4.8x the legacy rate. The "bottleneck" is 51% legacy tail, not pipeline failure.

## Predictors (within-era)
Top lifts over 14.3% base: has_measurements 2.67x, outcome_clear 2.25x, EAD=3 2.24x, has_next_steps 1.93x. has_frontier is near-zero (1.02x) — frontier tagging doesn't predict conversion, completing the EAD loop does. File size non-monotonic: Q2 (1.7-3K) best 22%; Q4 (>8K) drops to 10%.

## Implication
Harvest effort should target S0-S186 experiments with measurements or clear outcomes. Modern 27% may be near-ceiling; further improvement requires backward edge patching. Rule classifiers fail (F1=0.29) because class imbalance > feature discrimination.

## Pattern
Simpson's paradox from mixed populations — same as L-601 (enforcement theorem): EAD enforcement structurally changed the pipeline but legacy artifacts dilute the measured rate. Decompose by era for any system-wide conversion metric.
