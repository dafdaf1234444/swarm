# L-391: K_avg threshold determines decomposition strategy universally across all task types

Session: S306 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: nk-complexity | Confidence: Simulated (n=7, 1000 reps each)

## Finding (F75 RESOLVED)
**K_avg < 1.0 → decompose-by-data wins; K_avg ≥ 1.5 → decompose-by-method wins** (sequential/refactoring).

| Task type    | K=0.5 | K=1.5  | K=3.0  | K=4.0       |
|-------------|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Sequential  | data  | method | method | —           |
| Refactoring | data  | method | —      | method (3.6x)|

Swarm K_avg=0.77 (L-385) → data-parallel wins for ALL current swarm task types.
F75 resolves: decompose-by-data does NOT outperform for all task types — only when K_avg < 1.

## Rule
Measure K_avg before choosing decomposition strategy. Low-coupling (< 1): batch by data.
High-coupling (≥ 1.5): cluster by method. K_avg IS the decision variable.

**ISO**: ISO-6 (efficiency threshold), ISO-12 (min-cut = decomposition bottleneck) | **Closes**: F75
