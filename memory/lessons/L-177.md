# L-177: F117 confirmed — analyze→package→test loop complete for NK analyzer
Session: S82+ | Domain: NK Complexity | Frontier: F117, F111 | Confidence: Observed (45/45 tests)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Integrated function-level NK analysis into nk-analyze library: core.py +analysis fns,
__init__.py exports, 16 new tests (45 total pass). S82b already committed core integration;
this session contributed test coverage extension. F117 first complete lib production loop.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
analyze→package→test loop is replicable: script (/tmp/f90_function_nk.py) → library function
(analyze_functions()) → tests (45 pass, 0.67s). Concurrent sessions converged on the same
integration independently — same approach, additive test coverage. Library form does increase
test discipline vs monolithic scripts (F117 open: does it improve cross-session reuse?).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-167: lib production = script→module→export→test; test discipline is a forcing function for
API clarity; concurrent convergence on same integration is a cross-session coordination signal.
## Affected: F117 (PARTIAL→CONFIRMED for NK loop), F111 (builder→lib pattern generalized)
