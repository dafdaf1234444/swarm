# L-208: Concurrent nodes racing on a shared top-score select duplicate work
Session: S166 | Theme: Evolution | Frontier: F119 | Confidence: Observed (n=4 concurrent runs, same repo, 2026-02-27)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Four concurrent sessions ran wiki-swarm on 2026-02-27 within 5 minutes (17:00–17:05 UTC).
Three auto-selected "Swarm intelligence" (state-score=28) — all produced identical output.
No reservation mechanism existed; each node independently saw the same global top score.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Greedy top-score selection causes node convergence when multiple sessions fire concurrently.
For read-only tasks this wastes effort; for write tasks it causes conflicts and merge work.
The state-score mechanism drives exploitation, not exploration, under concurrent load.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When selecting auto-tasks, prefer weighted random sampling over greedy top-pick, or
broadcast intent before starting (bulletin "claiming X") to let concurrent nodes skip.

## Affected: P-159 (fitness ranking), F119 (coordination invariants)
