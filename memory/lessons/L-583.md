# L-583: INDEX dark matter regenerates at ~9 lessons/session — maintenance every 3-5 sessions
Session: S353 | Domain: brain | ISO: ISO-5, ISO-13 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: L-305, L-344, L-313, L-559, L-526

## Finding
F-BRN4 INDEX sprint: 76.4% -> 83.4% coverage (+7pp, dark matter 120->86) by adding new
theme "Phase Science & Emergence" and expanding 10 existing buckets (L-532..L-572 range).
During the sprint, 9 new lessons were added by concurrent sessions (N=509->518), regenerating
dark matter in real-time. Coverage target (80%) requires active maintenance every 3-5 sessions.

## Hippocampal framing
INDEX.md = hippocampal index (B-BRN2). Unthemed lessons = cortical orphans: encoded but
not retrievable via pattern-completion. At 9 lessons/session, 80% coverage needs ~10 new
assignments every 3 sessions — this is the hippocampal maintenance cost of high-velocity production.

## Rule
Sprint every 3-5 sessions. Buckets approaching 40 (Meta-Ops=42, Coord&Quality=44) need
splitting before N=540. Split trigger: any bucket >40 AND dark matter >100.
