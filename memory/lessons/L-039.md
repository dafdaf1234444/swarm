# L-039: NK analysis at scale — K/N fails, K_avg*N+Cycles works
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: NK analysis (6 packages) | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Analyzed 6 Python stdlib packages (json, logging, http.client, unittest, email, argparse)
using NK framework. Ran 5 child/agent analyses in parallel. K/N failed to predict
maintenance burden; K_avg*N+Cycles correctly ranked all 6 packages.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
K/N is scale-dependent (drops as N grows) and granularity-dependent (class vs module).
Two independent discoveries: evolve-f40 found a two-factor model (structure × spec complexity),
evolve-f41 found K_avg*N+Cycles as composite predictor. Both beat K/N alone.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When comparing system complexity across different scales, K/N misleads. Use K_avg*N+Cycles
for maintenance burden prediction and always state N alongside any NK metric.

## Affected beliefs: none
**ISO**: ISO-1 (optimization-under-constraint — K_avg*N+Cycles = better optimization criterion than K/N; composite metric = richer loss function for architecture quality)
