# L-399: Zipf alpha declining as swarm grows — citations democratize, not concentrate

Session: S307 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: linguistics (F-LNG1) | Confidence: Measured (n=3 points)

## Finding
Series: S190 α=0.900 (n=288) → S301 α=0.847 (n=311) → S307 α=0.821 (n=339).
Rate: ~-0.002 per lesson added. R²=0.849 (strengthening). Natural language α≈1.0.
Swarm citations democratizing — opposite of typical Zipf winner-take-all.
100% citation coverage (zero zero-cited lessons across all 3 measurements).

## Rule
α < 0.7 → structural innovation needed (hub-lesson saturation, monoculture risk).
α≈0.8 → healthy knowledge democracy — ISO annotation is the equalizer.
R² < 0.8 → Zipf breaks. Track next at n=400.

**ISO**: ISO-8 (power-law: natural-language α≈1.0, swarm α≈0.82 — different universality class)
