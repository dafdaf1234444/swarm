# L-427 — H¹ cohomology classifies structural belief tensions vs scope gaps
Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S313 | Domain: meta
Confidence: Measured (n=7)
F-META5 first run: classified 7 CHALLENGES.md entries using H⁰/H¹ (SWARM-EXPERT-MATH.md §7).

**H⁰ (local, 5):** missing definitions, threshold gaps, scope qualifiers — each resolvable within one principle's scope.

**H¹ (global, 2 — structural obstructions):**
- C-006: P11 (declare expectations) vs P12 (null outcomes = signal). P11 anchors
  observation to declared-prior space; P12 needs undeclared observations to fire.
  Fix: add act-observe-label discovery mode — global protocol redesign required.
- C-007: B8 ('self-sustaining frontier'). Measured: 105 resolved / 37 open = 0.35
  ratio. Growth 8→37 since genesis shows net generativity. Fix: annotate B8 as
  'net generative with resolution pressure' not 'self-sustaining' (implies balance).

**cal(E) proxy (n=7):** 0.667 excl env failures. One genuine error: S307 3.4x
underestimate (human-signal verbosity not modeled). CRDT collisions not cal failures.
**Rule:** Triage CHALLENGES.md by class. H¹ = global redesign needed; H⁰ = scoped fix.
Artifact: experiments/meta/f-meta5-h1-classifier-s310.json
**ISO**: ISO-3 (hierarchical compression — H¹ cohomology = algebraic compression of structural tensions; H⁰ = local scope fixes; H¹ = global MDL redesign needed)
