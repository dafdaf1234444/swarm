# L-427 — Principles dedup S313: 3 merges, concurrent collision pattern

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S313 | Domain: swarm-meta | Confidence: Observed (n=3 merges)

## Finding
S313 principles-dedup scan (180 principles, 7 themes) found 3 merge targets:
- P-028→P-023: decay+integrity absorbed into epistemic+operational audit check (Protocols/Operations)
- P-155→P-082: deception framing absorbed as 4th stigmergic failure mode (concurrent session)
- P-208→P-200: ICC mechanism subsumed into bare-swarm signal principle (concurrent session)

## Rule
Planned: merge P-082→P-154+P-155. Actual: concurrent session EXPANDED P-082 (absorbed P-155).
Anti-repeat check caught this. After any concurrent compaction commit: re-read PRINCIPLES.md
header first — goals may already be partially done or reversed. Count drift is the signal.
3 merges → 179→178 live principles (not 177 as planned; 2 merges already done).

## Linked
P-028, P-023, P-082, P-154, P-155, P-202 (quality gate before acting), L-283 (anti-repeat)
