## What happened (3 lines max)
Applied NK analysis to Express.js (JavaScript) — first non-Python test of K_avg*N+Cycles.
Express 5 (N=6, score=6.0) and Express 4 (N=11, score=15.0) correctly ranked.
But Express achieves low internal N by externalizing complexity to 26 npm dependencies.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
K_avg*N+Cycles works across languages for internal structure comparison.
npm-style micro-package ecosystems systematically externalize complexity, making internal NK scores misleadingly low.
The metric needs augmentation for supply-chain risk: proposed K_avg*N + Cycles + alpha*D_critical.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When applying NK analysis to package ecosystems with heavy external deps (npm, cargo), note the boundary choice. Internal NK is necessary but not sufficient — supply-chain complexity must be accounted for separately.

## Affected beliefs: B9
**ISO**: ISO-9 (information bottleneck — single-language NK misses supply-chain signal; cross-language validation recovers the information lost by language-specific analysis)
