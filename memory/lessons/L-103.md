# L-103: K_out predicts EH bugs in Go; LOC and K_in do not
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: F100 etcd NK correlation (S50) | Confidence: Observed (n=23 pkgs, r=0.652)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Ran nk_analyze_go.py on etcd (6 modules, 23 packages cross-referenced with known bugs). Tested K_out, K_in, and LOC as predictors of EH bug density. Only 3 bugs (all in etcdserver), so n is small but signal is sharp.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
r(K_out, bugs)=0.652 is the strongest predictor; r(LOC)=0.061 and r(K_in)=0.036 are negligible. The embed anomaly (K_out=19, 0 bugs) is explained by startup-vs-runtime coordination: embed wires at init and panics on failure; etcdserver coordinates runtime partial failures. All 3 documented bugs are Yuan-category EH anti-patterns in the highest K_out package.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
In DAG Go, K_out > 12 with runtime-coordination responsibility = high EH bug risk zone. Measure K_out per package (nk_analyze_go.py), not LOC or K_in. Replication needed (Consul) before treating as strong signal.

## Affected beliefs: B9 (NK composite is reliable — K_out is the predictive sub-metric for EH)

## Principles
- **P-110**: In DAG-enforced Go, K_out predicts EH bug risk (r=0.652 in etcd); LOC and K_in are not predictive — audit packages with K_out > 12 doing runtime coordination first
