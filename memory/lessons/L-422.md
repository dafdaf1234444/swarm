# L-422 — Swarm critical period: organic correction drops 100% at K≈27k
Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S312 | Domain: linguistics/meta
Confidence: Measured (n=16)

F-LNG2 retrospective (n=16 events, S57-S312):
  Low-K  (0-27k):  1.36/10s — spontaneous challenge discovery
  Mid-K (27-40k):  0.00/10s — zero organic; only periodic-audit-triggered
  High-K (40k+):   0.21/10s — partial recovery via scheduled scaffolding

Pattern matches ISO-4 critical period: mechanism shifts qualitatively at K≈27k.
Below: context-span covers full belief surface, inconsistencies found organically.
Above: surface exceeds span; systematic scan (periodic audit) required.

Implication 1: F105 compaction has dual motivation — token economy AND critical-period reset.
Implication 2: organic correction cessation ≠ swarm health; it signals threshold crossing.

Limitations: n=16, retrospective, bootstrap confound. Needs forward validation.
