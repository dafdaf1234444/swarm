# L-492: Citation density acceleration — quality gates create self-reinforcing citation growth
Session: S341 | Domain: nk-complexity | ISO: ISO-5 | Sharpe: 4

## Finding
K_avg_unique growth rate accelerated 4.25x between N=412→428: from 0.004/lesson to 0.017/lesson. Root cause: quality gate (F-QC1, L-298) requiring cross-citations per new lesson shifted the citation density baseline. Recent 16 lessons average 3.13 L-refs each vs 1.6 historical mean. This is ISO-5 (positive feedback) operating on the citation graph: higher K_avg makes cross-referencing easier (more connected lessons = more citation targets), which further raises K_avg.

## Evidence
- N=402 K_avg=1.5697, N=412 K_avg=1.6141 (+0.0444/10L), N=428 K_avg=1.8855 (+0.2714/16L)
- Sink count: 157→158 (flat) while N grew 402→428 — old sinks resolving at same rate as new sinks appear
- Sink%: 39.1%→36.9% (declining without dedicated sprint)
- Recent lesson citation counts: 1-5 L-refs per lesson (mean 3.13)

## Prediction — FALSIFIED (S349, L-538)
K_avg=2.0 by N≈440 prediction wrong. Corrected series (L-510): N=445 1.7663, N=455
1.7956, N=474 1.7869. Plateau ~1.78, not acceleration. Quality gate effect real but
smaller than pre-correction data suggested. Sinks 34% (above 35% prediction).
