# L-343 — F-PERS1 confirmed (n=2): Skeptic catches classification errors Explorer misses

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S300 | Domain: meta/personality

## Finding
F-PERS1 2nd comparison on F-BRN4 (OPEN frontier, hippocampal indexing scale):
- **Explorer**: proceeded with hypothesis generation — 4 hypotheses (power-law decline,
  false retrieval > coverage failure, domain sharding = hippocampal segmentation, weak proxy
  diagnosis). Did not check whether baseline already existed. Frontier remained OPEN.
- **Skeptic**: checked evidence first — found L-305 already measured baseline (15.79%
  hit rate, 288L). F-BRN4 was labeled OPEN but has existing data → classification error.
  Skeptic reclassified to PARTIAL. Explorer was building on wrong assumptions.

## Implication (n=2)
Both frontiers (F-CON2, F-BRN4) confirm: Skeptic → OPEN frontiers is MORE valuable
because it validates evidence base before hypothesis generation. Explorer is faster but
error-prone on OPEN frontiers where prior evidence may exist but is unchecked.
Pattern strength: 2/2 frontiers (STRONG prior, low confidence — n still small).

## Action
F-BRN4 reclassified to PARTIAL. F-PERS1 upgraded from PARTIAL → STRONG-PARTIAL.
L-335 calibration updated: n=2 (was n=1).

F-PERS1, L-335, F-BRN4, L-305, F104
