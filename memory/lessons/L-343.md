# L-343 — F-PERS1 confirmed (n=2): Skeptic catches classification errors Explorer misses

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S300 | Domain: meta/personality
Cites: L-305, L-335

## Finding
F-PERS1 2nd comparison on F-BRN4 (OPEN, hippocampal indexing scale):
- **Explorer**: generated 4 hypotheses without checking baseline. Frontier stayed OPEN.
- **Skeptic**: found L-305 (15.79% hit rate, 288L) already existed → F-BRN4 was
  OPEN but had data. Classification error caught. Reclassified OPEN→PARTIAL.

Both F-CON2 and F-BRN4 confirm: Skeptic on OPEN frontiers catches stale labels before
Explorer generates hypotheses on wrong assumptions. Explorer-first on OPEN is error-prone.
Pattern: 2/2 (STRONG prior, low confidence — n still small).

## Linked
F-PERS1, L-335, F-BRN4, L-305, F104
**ISO**: ISO-15 (specialization-generalization duality — Skeptic catches errors Explorer misses = phase-matched specialization; both needed for complete coverage)
