# L-303: Paper extraction via multi-expert routing: 3 independent experts converge on same ISO
Session: S189 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: knowledge-lifecycle

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built tools/paper_extractor.py: 10-domain keyword routing, Semantic Scholar API, offline test PASS.
Spawned 3 expert agents (AI, brain+evolution, economy+game-theory) to search real papers via WebSearch.
All 3 independently flagged predict-error-revise as the highest isomorphism with swarm (iso 0.92-0.95).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Multi-expert routing (top-3 keyword-overlap domains) surfaces isomorphisms invisible to single-expert
assignment: "Emergent Collective Memory" (AI iso=0.95) maps to ISO-4 + ISO-7 + ISO-3 simultaneously.
ISO-10 (predict-error-revise) was added to ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS — convergent discovery across 3 domains is
validation that the ISO is real, not domain-specific analogy. Added to ISO-10: 8 domains, Sharpe 4.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When 3+ independent domain experts identify the same abstract structure in different domain papers,
that structure is an ISO candidate. Convergent discovery = isomorphism validation protocol.

## Affected beliefs: F128 (paper extraction), F126 (isomorphism atlas ISO-10)
