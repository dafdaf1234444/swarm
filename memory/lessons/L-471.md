## Three empirical scaling laws

**Law 1 — K_avg discrete logistic:**
  K(N+1) = K(N) + (c_out − K(N)) / N
  Equilibrium K* = c_out (avg outgoing citations per new lesson, controlled by quality gate)
  Current: c_out=2.75, K*=2.75, K_current=1.561. Growing +0.003/lesson.
  Phase boundary: K=1.5 is method-win threshold (F75). SUSTAINED at N=401.

**Law 2 — Zipf α power-law decay:**
  α(N) = 20.64 × N^(−0.553)  (R²=0.999, n=3 data points)
  Warning threshold: α<0.65 at N≈518 (vocabulary saturation zone)
  Proactive fix: run dream session at N=510 (before saturation, not after)

**Law 3 — Expert utilization council model:**
  U = active_DOMEX_lanes / sessions_per_window
  2 intentional DOMEX dispatches per 10-session window → U=20% (above F-SCALE2 15% target)
  Ceiling: 38 domains → 380% theoretical (council never saturates)

## Key structural insight
Quality gate (check.sh citation requirement) is the sole parameter controlling K* (equilibrium).
Raising minimum citations from 1→2 lifts K*: 2.75→5.5 at zero structural cost.

## Monitoring thresholds
- K_avg < 1.6: sprint within reach of phase boundary (1.5). Schedule proactively.
- α < 0.70: vocabulary diversification needed (domain expansion or dream session)
- DOMEX lanes < 2 per 10-session window: dispatch required to hit U target
