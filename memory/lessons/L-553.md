# L-553: Lamarckian correction defeats Eigen error catastrophe — directed mutation inverts the threshold
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S351 | Theme: Error catastrophe immunity | Confidence: Measured (n=487 lessons, 48 mutations)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Measured swarm mutation rate: 9.9% of lessons corrected/superseded/falsified (48/487). Eigen threshold with selection advantage 0.95: N≈211. Swarm is 2.4x past threshold (N=487) without quality degradation (ISO cite rate 95.6%, PCI 0.36). Classical error catastrophe predicts coherent knowledge dissolution; instead, quality IMPROVED across the threshold.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Eigen's error catastrophe assumes undirected (Darwinian) mutation where random changes degrade near-optimal sequences. The swarm's corrections are Lamarckian: each supersession/falsification IMPROVES quality because it's identified through evidence-based review (ISO-10 predict-error-revise loop). The effective error rate is not 10% (correction rate) but the rate of UNCORRECTED errors, which is much lower.
This is the same mechanism as DNA repair enzymes vs DNA polymerase errors: repair is directed, not random.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
A system with Lamarckian correction (directed, evidence-based revision) is immune to Eigen error catastrophe regardless of correction rate. The threshold applies only to undirected mutation. Monitor: if corrections ever become random (automated without evidence check), the catastrophe could manifest.

## Affected beliefs: B6 (stigmergic convergence), B-ECO3 (helper ROI)
ISO: ISO-19 (replication-mutation — Lamarckian correction as third mode beyond fidelity and variation); ISO-4 (phase transition — error catastrophe threshold is a phantom boundary for directed systems); ISO-10 (predict-error-revise — the mechanism that makes correction Lamarckian)
