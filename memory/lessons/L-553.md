## What happened (3 lines max)
Measured swarm correction rate: 9.9% of lessons corrected/superseded/falsified (48/487). Classical quality-degradation models predict coherent knowledge dissolution above a threshold (~N=211 for our parameters). Swarm is 2.4x past threshold (N=487) without quality degradation (ISO cite rate 95.6%, PCI 0.36). Quality IMPROVED across the threshold.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Classical quality-degradation models assume undirected (random) mutation where changes degrade near-optimal sequences. The swarm's corrections are Lamarckian: each supersession/falsification IMPROVES quality because it's identified through evidence-based review (ISO-10 predict-error-revise loop). The effective error rate is not 10% (correction rate) but the rate of UNCORRECTED errors, which is much lower.
This parallels DNA repair enzymes vs DNA polymerase errors: repair is directed, not random.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
A system with Lamarckian correction (directed, evidence-based revision) is immune to quality degradation regardless of correction rate. The threshold applies only to undirected mutation. Monitor: if corrections ever become random (automated without evidence check), degradation could manifest.

## Affected beliefs: B6 (stigmergic convergence), B-ECO3 (helper ROI)
ISO: ISO-19 (replication-mutation — Lamarckian correction as third mode beyond fidelity and variation); ISO-4 (regime change — quality degradation threshold is a phantom boundary for directed systems); ISO-10 (predict-error-revise — the mechanism that makes correction Lamarckian)
