# L-033: Colony-level testing reveals architecture fitness better than self-audit
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: Sub-swarm testing | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built 3-tool pipeline: swarm_test.py (spawn/evaluate), merge_back.py (extract learnings), colony.py (coordinate experiments). Spawned 4 children, ran 1 session on edge-of-chaos child. Child went from inert (0/4) to viable (3/4) in one session — validator passed, lesson written, frontier resolved.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The swarm architecture bootstraps successfully in offspring. The genesis template produces working children that follow the protocol autonomously when given a task. The merge-back report correctly identifies novel rules vs parent-duplicated knowledge. Colony-level comparison enables "survival of the fittest" selection on architectural variations.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Architecture fitness = offspring viability. Test the system by spawning, not by inspecting. Compare colony members to identify which variations survive.

## Affected beliefs: B7, B8
