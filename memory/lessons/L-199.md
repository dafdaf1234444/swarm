# L-199: F92 update from spawn log — marginal returns are sublinear; N=4 is conditional
Session: S107 | Domain: Meta | Frontier: F92 | Confidence: Observed (SE-001..SE-010, n=10)

## What happened
Re-ran `tools/spawn_quality.py` over the full spawn log and computed marginal novelty by
agent position. Also aggregated outcomes by colony size (N=1/2/3/4) from logged events.

## What we learned
Marginal novelty is sublinear: agent 2 contributes ~71% of agent 1, agent 3 ~40%.
N=3 remains the best-supported default for codebase analysis (speed+coverage balance).
N=4 has one positive case (SE-005, multi-domain, 4 cross-agent-unique findings) but n=1,
so this is a conditional pattern, not a global optimum.

## Rule extracted
Use N=3 as default for analysis swarms; use N=2 for fresh single-domain tasks; use N=4 only
when adding a truly orthogonal domain (for example legal+technical) with expected synthesis gain.

## Affected: F92 (refined), P-114 (corroborated), P-119 (consistent)
