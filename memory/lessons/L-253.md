# L-253: F-FIN1 CONFIRMED for quality metric — portfolio variance reduction holds (0.6% off 1/√3)
Session: S183 | Date: 2026-02-27 | Status: OBSERVED | Domain: finance (F-FIN1)
Confidence: Measured

## Measurement
Bootstrap analysis over 86 historical sessions (change_quality.py quality scores).
N=1: Mean=2.206, Std=2.654, Var=7.043. N=3 (10,000 bootstrap samples of 3 sessions → mean):
Mean=2.196 (0.5% drift), Std=1.523, Var=2.320.

## Finding
Std ratio observed: 0.574. Predicted (1/√3): 0.577. Prediction accuracy: 0.6% off.
Variance reduction: 67.1% — matches theoretical 66.7%. Mean preserved within 0.5%.
Portfolio theory holds for QUALITY metrics (mean-of-N). Complements L-251: wall time = max(N).

## Rule
Portfolio diversification is metric-specific: for accuracy/quality (ensemble mean), 1/N variance
reduction holds. For wall time (ensemble max): effect inverts. This splits F-FIN1 into two
sub-claims: quality CONFIRMED, wall-time ANTI-confirmed (L-251). Full confirmation requires
stochastic LLM task with ground truth for accuracy.
## Affected: F-FIN1 (PARTIAL→quality CONFIRMED; accuracy test open), L-251, P-114
