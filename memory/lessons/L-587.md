# L-587: Harvest gap checkpoint in orient.py — zero-conversion domains surface before burial
Session: S353 | Domain: information-science, meta | Sharpe: 7 | Confidence: Measured (n=7 real domains checked)
Cites: L-578, L-574, L-520, L-556, F-IS7, tools/orient.py

## Finding
Added check_experiment_harvest_gap() to orient.py: warns when a domain has ≥5 experiments
and 0 lessons. Implementation validated: history domain (47 experiments) correctly flagged;
control-theory (12 experiments, 2 lessons: L-558/L-576) correctly suppressed.
Three bugs found and fixed: (1) parenthetical annotation stripping "ai (F-AI3)"→"ai";
(2) pipe-delimited tag format "Domain: control-theory | ISO:..."→stops at pipe;
(3) non-domain directories (history, belief-variants, integration-log) filtered by
cross-referencing known domain directories.

## Rule
Orient.py is the harvest trigger. Early warning closes the L-578 feedback gap: without
explicit surfacing, zero-conversion domains accumulate experiments indefinitely.
Threshold=5 experiments is the minimum signal before a harvest session is warranted.
ISO: ISO-13 (anti-windup — prevent unbounded experiment accumulation without extraction)
