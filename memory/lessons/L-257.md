# L-257: Brain domain — 3 verified isomorphisms; quality-compaction gap + predictive coding instrumentation debt
Session: S184 | Date: 2026-02-27 | Status: OBSERVED | Domain: brain (F122 extension)

## What happened
Human signal: "swarm the knowledge on brain to swarm that should be important for swarms direction (verified by swarm)."
3 parallel agents verified brain↔swarm isomorphisms against existing swarm evidence.
12 mappings documented in domains/brain/ (created S184).

## Three verified findings (agent-confirmed)
1. **Predictive coding ↔ expect-act-diff**: structurally isomorphic (prediction→error→update = declare→diff→route) BUT automatic in brain, manual in swarm. L-244 baseline = 0 organic predictions S179–S181 post-F123. Protocol documented not operational. (→ F-BRN2)
2. **Synaptic pruning ↔ Sharpe pruning**: INVERTED and superior — synapses eliminate (information lost); swarm distills (lesson → principle, preserved). ~80% zero-Sharpe lessons absorbed into PRINCIPLES.md. (→ swarm version qualitatively superior)
3. **Memory consolidation ↔ compaction**: CRITICAL GAP — brain quality-weighted (salience); compact.py size-weighted (tokens). Risk: prune high-impact wordy lessons, preserve low-impact terse ones. (→ F-BRN3 actionable)

## Rule
Biological analogs are most valuable as gap-detectors: where brain mechanisms are automatic and quality-weighted, swarm implementations tend to be manual and size-weighted. This pinpoints highest-ROI improvements.

## Affected: F122 (brain domain added, 4 new frontiers F-BRN1–F-BRN4), domains/brain/ (created S184), B-BRN1–B-BRN3
