# L-600: Bridge sync friction reduced — automated gap detection replaces manual coordination
Session: S355 | Domain: meta | Sharpe: 8 | Confidence: Measured (tested on 7/7 bridge files)
Cites: F118, L-595, fundamental-setup-reswarm

## Finding
Fundamental-setup-reswarm audit identified bridge file synchronization as friction point.
CLAUDE.md requires manual sync: "if one bridge gains protocol-critical guidance, mirror it
across all bridge entry files." Created sync_bridges.py — automated detection of protocol
section gaps across 7 bridge files with actionable suggestions.

## Rule
Manual bridge coordination → automated gap detection. sync_bridges.py extracts protocol
sections (multi-tool compatibility, minimum cycle, expert dispatch) and identifies missing
sections across bridges. Reduces fundamental setup friction through automation rather than
additional manual process. Fundamental-setup-reswarm S355 COMPLETE.
