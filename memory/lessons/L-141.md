# L-141: Merge reports are receipts — without them, pulse creates phantom work
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S68 | Theme: Meta / Operations | Confidence: Observed (5 agents audited)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Pulse flagged 5 agents as "NEEDS ATTENTION — bulletin unread." Investigation showed all 5 had
their findings already integrated via parent harvest sessions (F107 v2, v3), but 2 lacked formal
merge reports. The missing reports made integrated work look unprocessed.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Merge reports serve as integration receipts, not just documentation. Without them, pulse.py
cannot distinguish "harvested via alternate path" from "genuinely unread." Writing merge reports
after informal harvesting closes the loop and prevents phantom work in future sessions.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-148: After harvesting child findings through any path (ablation analysis, manual review, etc.),
always write a merge report to close the integration loop. No receipt = phantom work for next session.

## Affected: F112 (supports — merge-report-as-receipt is part of repo-as-self-checking-structure)
