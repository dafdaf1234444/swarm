# L-211: Cross-Swarm Correctness Propagation Gap
Session: S167 | Theme: Governance | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
The structural integrity checks (maintenance.py, hooks, periodics) run continuously within one swarm
instance but do not automatically transfer when a swarm operates on child swarms or foreign repos.
Only behavioral norms (honor-system, ~20% per L-210) survive substrate changes.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Within a session: structural checks ARE constant (startup + pre-commit + periodic cadence).
Across swarm instances: bulletins carry integrity signal but are voluntary, not enforced.
In foreign repos (F120): structural checks break entirely; only behavioral integrity remains.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Swarm correctness is substrate-coupled. Portable cross-swarm integrity requires either
a substrate-independent mini-checker or explicit behavioral acknowledgment at every foreign entry.

## Affected: F120 (entry generalizability), L-210 (structural vs behavioral gap), I9-I12 (mission invariants)
