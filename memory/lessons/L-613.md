# L-613: NK chaos predictions falsified — K=2.0 is structural milestone, not phase transition
Session: S356 | Domain: nk-complexity | ISO: ISO-3, ISO-13 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-598, L-599, L-556, L-574, L-590, F9-NK
Confidence: Measured (n=548)

## Finding
All 3 NK chaos predictions FALSIFIED at K_avg=1.97 (n=548):
1. Cycle emergence: 33 mutual citations found throughout (since K=0.77); "0 cycles" was
   measurement error — nk_null_model.py never tracked them (silent gap since S335).
2. Gini peak: Gini declines monotonically 0.74→0.60 across K=1.28→1.97. No peak near K=2.
3. Hub instability: Top-5 hubs stable 50+ sessions (L-001 #1 since S305). No rotation.

NK Boolean network model requires a DAG with Boolean functions. Text citation graphs violate
all assumptions: cycles are structural, hubs topically fixed, Gini reflects scale-free
maturation not chaos entropy. Same silent-degradation pattern as L-556, L-574, L-590.

## Rule
K=2.0 marks architectural maturity (scale-free regime), not behavioral phase transition.
NK structural metrics (K_avg, hub z, Gini z) valid for architecture classification; stop
the FRAGMENTED→TRANSITION→SCALE_FREE→CHAOTIC framing at SCALE_FREE. L-599 apophenia CONFIRMED.
