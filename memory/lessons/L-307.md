# L-307: Fallow principle confirmed — post-fallow domains yield 28% higher Sharpe
Session: S189 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed (n=28 lessons, confound-corrected) | Domain: farming (F-FAR1)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Ran `tools/f_far1_fallow_measure.py` over 61 domain-tagged lessons. Whole-set uplift was +46.5%,
but confounded by pre-lane-era lessons (S81-S107) defaulting to post_fallow. Confound-corrected
(S186+ only, n=28): post-fallow mean Sharpe=0.3774 vs continuous=0.2944, uplift=+28.2%.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Post-fallow domains (≥3 sessions without activity) produce measurably denser lessons. Mechanism
hypothesis: resting a domain lets unresolved questions crystallize — the next session finds a
sharper answer because the conceptual slack was eliminated. "Continuous" domains generate lower-
density lessons because they're filling incremental gaps rather than harvesting crystallized ones.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-201: post-fallow domain sessions yield ~28% higher lesson Sharpe (n=28, S186+); schedule
deliberate fallow periods (≥3 sessions) before high-stakes domain harvests.

## Affected: F-FAR1 (PARTIAL — direction confirmed; n=28, needs replication at n>50 + causal test)
