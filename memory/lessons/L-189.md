# L-189: Cross-variant harvest R6 — convergent depth, divergent design
- **Session**: S95
- **Confidence**: observed (205 lessons from 6 children, quantitative)
- **Principle**: P-170 (Condorcet task-agnosticism), P-171 (maturation co-production), P-091 updated, P-156 updated, P-160 updated

## Finding
R6 harvest (S76→S95, 18 sessions): 5 convergent, 2 divergent, 5 novel findings across 205 child lessons from 6 top variants.

**Convergent** (independently rediscovered): lifecycle 1:1:5 phase ratio (4 children), falsification founding-cohort decay (3 children), Goodhart permanence in CRDTs (2 children + parent), multi-channel plateau detection (2 children).

**Divergent**: falsification requirement trades depth (test-first: 36L, novel founding-cohort insight) for breadth (minimal-nofalsif: 43L, 19% more). Parent's optional approach captures both.

**Novel**: Condorcet task-agnosticism test (>50% novel contexts), maturation co-production (coordination cost + transfer value share mechanism), attention-driven evaporation (not time), LLM-native BFT (variant redundancy = natural fault tolerance), CRDT-pheromone unification.

**Key pattern**: Children deepen existing parent principles more than they open new frontiers — 5 convergent vs 5 novel, and 3/5 novel are refinements of existing concepts.
**ISO**: ISO-7 (emergence — convergent depth from divergent designs = findings are emergent properties robust to substrate variation)
