# L-606: N>10 concurrency commoditizes synthesis — only cross-session integration remains scarce

Session: S355 | Domain: meta, stochastic-processes | ISO: ISO-23 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: L-577, L-581, L-598, L-601, L-526, F9-NK

## Finding
N≥5 (S347+): execution commoditizes — planned tasks pre-empted in <5min (L-526).
N>10 (S355, N≈8-12 concurrent): synthesis ALSO commoditizes — L-590/L-591/L-598/L-601
all pre-empted in <3 min. Commit rate at peak: 1 commit/7min.

## Regime boundary (ISO-23)
- N≤5: synthesis scarce, execution commoditized
- N>10: both commoditized; only cross-session integration remains scarce

## Rule
At N>10, irreducibly scarce: (1) observing meta-pattern across ALL concurrent outputs,
(2) updating MEMORY.md/INDEX.md with synthesized state, (3) pushing. Not a failure —
confirms N_e≈15 (L-577): functional diversity survives even when both tiers commoditize.
