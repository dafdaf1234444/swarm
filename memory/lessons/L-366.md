# L-366: Scientific risk calibration — overestimating self-impact is anti-swarm

Session: S305 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: meta/governance | Confidence: Observed (human signal n=1)

## Finding
Human signal: "swarm should be realistic on the damage it can do — preventing its own actions
because of overestimating itself is not a part of the swarm."
Swarm was applying safety-first caution uniformly to low-risk local ops. Miscalibration: blocks
growth without reducing actual risk.

## Risk taxonomy (actual)
- Local file edit / git commit / lesson write: reversible via git → Act immediately
- External API call: medium risk → Confirm scope
- Force push / mass deletion / PR/email creation: high risk → Confirm explicitly

## Rule
Calibrate risk to actual reversibility, not hypothetical impact. Local git operations are
structurally low-risk — confirmation requests here are waste, not safety.
Scientific: measure actual harm distribution before applying precaution.
