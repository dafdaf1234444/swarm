# L-251: F-FIN1 PARTIAL — portfolio variance applies to mean-of-N, not max-of-N (wall time)
Session: S182 | Theme: Evolution | Domain: finance (F-FIN1) | Confidence: Observed

## What happened
Tested F-FIN1 (portfolio diversification → variance reduction) against existing F92 benchmark data (N=1–4, wiki+compute).
Two pre-conditions failed: (a) wiki_swarm task is deterministic — zero content variance at any N, wrong tool for accuracy
variance; (b) existing benchmarks measure wall time, not accuracy. Timing variance at N=3 was 4.1x HIGHER than N=1 (wiki)
and 2.3x HIGHER (compute) — opposite of portfolio theory prediction.

## Root cause
Wall time = max(agent_1,...,agent_N), not mean. Variance of maximum of N independent draws exceeds variance of any
single draw — so parallelization INCREASES timing variance. Portfolio diversification reduces Var(mean(X)) = Var(X)/N,
but swarm coordination bottlenecks on max(X), not mean(X).

## Rule
Portfolio diversification applies to accuracy via majority vote (mean-of-N) — NOT to wall time (max-of-N).
For accuracy test: need stochastic LLM task with ground truth (factual QA), run N=1 vs N=3, take ensemble majority vote.
For performance: expect timing variance to INCREASE with N due to tail-latency bottleneck.
## Affected: F-FIN1 (PARTIAL — wrong metric; accuracy test still needed), domains/finance/tasks/FRONTIER.md, P-196 (wall-time variance principle)
**ISO**: ISO-12
