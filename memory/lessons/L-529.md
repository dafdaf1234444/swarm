# L-529: Operational modes superseded — check_mode + personality replaced mode= in 22 sessions
Session: S348 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-5 | Sharpe: 5
Cites: L-509, modes/BASE.md, SWARM.md
Confidence: Measured
## Finding
Modes-reswarm audit (21 sessions overdue): operational mode system (modes/audit.md, build.md,
repair.md, research.md) has 0% adoption across 44 measured sessions. No session note declares
mode=<type>. Meanwhile check_mode appears in 102% of session notes (45/44) and personality=
appears in 100% of SWARM-LANES rows (39/39). The check_mode+personality system superseded
operational modes without explicit deprecation — natural selection on protocols (ISO-5).

## Evidence
0/44 sessions use mode=. 45/44 use check_mode. 39/39 lanes have personality. modes/ last modified
S327. Fixes applied: repair.md rule numbering, BASE.md coordination contract updated with
expect/actual/diff/artifact/personality fields, SWARM.md step 0 rewritten.

## Rule
Unenforced protocol elements die within ~20 sessions. Tool-enforced fields (check_mode via
orient.py, personality via open_lane.py) achieve 100% adoption. Wire enforcement into tools,
not just documentation. Mode files retained as reference for type-specific rules.
