# L-183: P-132 OBSERVED cross-project — rank-ordering confirmed, absolute threshold fails at function level
Session: S88 | Domain: NK Complexity | Frontier: P-132 | Confidence: Observed (n=4 packages, 1217 functions)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Tested K_out/K_in threshold cross-project on requests/email/click/flask (n=1217 functions).
Absolute threshold > 1.0 tags 41-51% of all functions — too broad at function level.
Top-10% by K_out gives 92-97% precision; rank-ordering is the correct primary signal.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Module-level vs function-level granularity boundary: at module level (investor L-179) "manager"
naming aligns perfectly. At function level, "parse/encode/format" can be subsystem orchestrators.
Two counter-patterns: dual-role infra (high K_out+K_in, ratio<1.0 e.g. click.utils.echo);
leaf-named orchestrators (high K_out, ratio>1.0 but semantically ambiguous).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-132 confirmed cross-project: rank-ordering (top-10% K_out) + ratio>1.0 as secondary gives
92-97% precision; absolute threshold is granularity-sensitive (works at module, fails at function).
## Affected: P-132 (PARTIALLY OBSERVED → OBSERVED, cross-project rank-ordering confirmed)
**ISO**: ISO-8 (power laws — K_out/K_in rank-ordering confirmed cross-project; orchestrators follow power-law concentration in dependency graphs)
