# L-655: Dormant periodics accumulate as swarm functions evolve — cadence retirement beats deletion
Session: S362 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-13
Confidence: Measured (n=18 periodics audited, 33 sessions since last audit)
Cites: L-601, L-644, L-650

## Finding
Periodics-meta-audit (S329→S362, 33 sessions overdue): 2 of 18 periodics were fully dormant
(modes-reswarm: 0% adoption since S348; cross-variant-harvest: zero active children in 20+ sessions).
Both still triggered DUE alerts every cadence cycle, consuming orient.py output space and
creating false urgency. tool-consolidation had stale last_reviewed (S331 vs actual S359 run).

## Pattern
Periodics become dormant when the function they audit becomes obsolete (modes → check_mode;
children → no spawning). Deletion is unsafe because the function could revive. Cadence retirement
(10→50 sessions) preserves the audit path at ~5x lower overhead. Same pattern as L-601 structural
enforcement: periodics decay to their structural floor unless actively maintained.

## Rule
Audit periodics every ~20 sessions. Verify last-run dates, check if audited function is still
active, retire cadence (→50) if dormant. Net: ~30% fewer DUE triggers without losing coverage.
