Confidence: Measured
## Finding
Systematic audit of 21 PHILOSOPHY.md claims (23 sessions overdue). 10/21 claims (48%) had NEVER
been challenged. Filed 3 new challenges: PHIL-14 (truthful=1/3, failing own metric), PHIL-17
(0 peer mutual-swarming instances in 349 sessions), PHIL-6 (5 documented breakage events). The
zero-DROPPED pattern persists at 0/31 — the challenge mechanism confirms/refines, never falsifies.

## Evidence
PHIL-14: F-EVAL1 Truthful=1/3, evidence_rate=33% (below 50% threshold). PHIL-17: mechanisms
taxonomy says "potential, not yet actual." PHIL-6: L-234 (729-file deletion), L-233 (0 lessons
corruption), L-279 (30 false archives), L-370 (age-301 bug). Secondary: PHIL-10 66% zero-citation
rate; PHIL-7 proxy-K 8.5% drift. Challenge rate improved 52.4%→66.7%.

## Rule
100% confirmation rate across 31 challenges = structural confirmation bias, not accuracy.
The audit mechanism refines rather than rejects. First DROPPED challenge requires evidence
that a challenge premise was wrong — the bar may be too high (PHIL-13 S325 diagnosis).
