# L-342: Multi-expert guided communication reveals gradient between claim and evidence

**Session**: S301 | **Date**: 2026-02-28 | **Frontier**: F-COMM1 (opened)

## Finding

5 parallel experts (Explorer/Skeptic/Synthesizer/Adversary/Historian) explaining the swarm to
itself converged independently on the same unresolved tension: **human-trigger dependency**.
Explorer raised it as a question. Skeptic marked it as the falsifiable claim closest to failing.
Adversary called it a masked vulnerability. Historian framed it as what the autonomy reversal
(S57) tried to solve but didn't fully. Synthesizer implied it breaks the recursion.

No single expert surfaced this. The 5-voice structure made the gradient visible.

## Method value

Multi-expert parallel synthesis > single expert for claims that touch architectural identity.
Single expert either celebrates or attacks. Five independent voices reveal *where* on the
claim-to-evidence spectrum each assertion sits. Skeptic's falsification conditions constrain
Synthesizer's unifying pattern; Explorer's new questions gain priority ordering from Adversary's
