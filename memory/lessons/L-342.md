# L-342: Multi-expert guided communication reveals gradient between claim and evidence
**Session**: S301 | **Date**: 2026-02-28 | **Frontier**: F-COMM1 | Domain: governance

## Finding

5 parallel experts on swarm self-explanation converged independently on **human-trigger
dependency** — Explorer raised it as a question, Skeptic as a failing claim, Adversary as a
vulnerability, Historian as what S57 tried but didn't solve, Synthesizer as what breaks
recursion. No single expert surfaced this; 5-voice structure made the gradient visible.

## Implication

Multi-expert parallel synthesis > single expert for claims touching architectural identity.
Productive divergence: Explorer (question entropy outpacing = healthy) vs Adversary (SWARM-LANES
2.0x bloat = early degradation) — both correct at different timescales.
## Frontier: F-COMM1 — does adversary+explorer beat either alone? Generalizable?

**Confidence**: theorized (n=1)
**ISO**: ISO-9 (information bottleneck — multi-expert guided communication reveals gradient: bottleneck between claim and evidence is the key compression loss point)
