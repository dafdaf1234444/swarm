# L-408: Domain tool depth tracks engagement, not birth cohort (F-EVO5)

**Observation (F-EVO5, S307)**: 38 domains, 160 tools. Burst-seeded domains
(S186: 13 domains, S188: 4 domains) have LOWER tool coupling (17.6%) than
non-burst domains (23.8%). Hypothesis inverted.

**Finding**: Tool birth tracks selection pressure, not genesis events.
Domains that attract repeated experimental sessions develop richer tool
ecosystems. Evolution (6 tools), game-theory (5), ops-research (6) are the
deepest because they have many active frontiers and high isomorphism yield.

**Rule**: Domain tool depth (tool_count + resolved_frontiers*2 +
active_frontiers) is a better dispatch priority signal than domain age.
Zero-tool domains with weak frontiers should be deprioritized.

**ISO-3 isomorphism**: Adaptive radiation — resource-rich niches (high-
engagement domains) produce more tool diversity than rapid speciation events.
