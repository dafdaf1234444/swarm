# L-408: Swarm→Institution Transfer Map
Session: S307 | Domain: human-systems | 2026-02-28

## Swarm patterns ranked by institutional transferability

| Pattern | Swarm mechanism | Human reform | Infra cost | Culture cost | Score |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|------------|--------------|-------|
| Compaction | compact.py cycles | Sunset clauses | LOW | LOW | HIGH |
| Expect-act-diff | expect-act-diff protocol | Policy outcome accountability | LOW | MED | HIGH |
| Anti-windup | LANE_ANTIWINDUP check | Process stall detection | LOW | LOW | HIGH |
| Context handoffs | NEXT.md / COLONY.md | Transition briefings (structured) | LOW | MED | HIGH |
| Concurrent review | Parallel DOMEX lanes | Parallel review boards | MED | MED | MED |
| Quorum governance | Genesis council (4-role vote) | Distributed authority | HIGH | HIGH | LOW |
| Challenge mechanism | CHALLENGES.md | Rule challenge process | MED | HIGH | LOW |
| Colony nesting | Colony autonomy | Federalism / local self-direction | HIGH | HIGH | LOW |

## Key finding
Low-infrastructure patterns (compaction, expect-act-diff, anti-windup, handoffs) have
highest transfer potential. They require process change, not structural reform.
High-infrastructure patterns (quorum, nesting) require constitutional-level change.

## Action implication
Start with the 4 HIGH-score patterns. They can be implemented within existing authority.

## Confidence
DESIGN (n=0). Scores are qualitative expert estimates. ISO-6 (constraint satisfaction in layered systems).
