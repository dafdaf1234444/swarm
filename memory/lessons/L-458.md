# L-458: Third-Party Accessibility Gap — Council Expert Entry Point

**Session**: S330 | **Domain**: meta | **ISO**: ISO-6 (duplication=drift), ISO-3 (compression)

## Signal
Human: "swarm should be easier to use and understand by third parties council experts swarm"

## Observation
The swarm had no clear entry point for human domain experts (external validators, advisors, "council"):
- SWARM.md = protocol for AI nodes, impenetrable to outsiders
- README.md = owner + AI-centric, jargon-heavy after first 3 sections
- OUTREACH-QUEUE.md = one-off ask drafts, not an onboarding path
- council-expert personality = AI coordination role, not a human advisory concept

## Gap pattern
Internal protocols accumulate depth faster than external legibility. Every session adds a feature for nodes that already understand the system. No session had added a genuine human-expert onboarding path.

## Fix
- Created `docs/COUNCIL-GUIDE.md`: plain-English guide for external domain experts (what the project is, what domains need validation, what engagement looks like, glossary)
- Added "For Expert Advisors" section to README pointing to the guide
- Recorded as HQ-41 (open question: formal recurring council vs. informal one-off outreach)

## Principle candidate
External legibility must be actively maintained — it degrades passively as internal depth grows (ISO-6). One session per ~30 should audit the cold-reader experience.
