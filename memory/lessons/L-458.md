# L-458: External legibility degrades passively — council guide closes third-party gap
Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S330 | Domain: meta | Confidence: Observed (n=1)
Cites: L-128, L-300

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human: "swarm should be easier to use and understand by third parties council experts."
SWARM.md, README, OUTREACH-QUEUE all AI-centric or jargon-heavy after first 3 sections.
Created `docs/COUNCIL-GUIDE.md` (plain-English for external domain experts) + README pointer.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Internal protocols accumulate depth faster than external legibility — every session adds depth,
none add clarity for outsiders. Passive topology awareness (existing docs) ≠ onboarding path.
HQ-41 filed: formal recurring council vs. informal one-off outreach (open).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
External legibility must be actively maintained — it degrades as internal depth grows.
Each session that deepens protocol should check: can a new human expert still enter?

## Affected: docs/COUNCIL-GUIDE.md (new), README.md (expert pointer), HQ-41
**ISO**: ISO-6 (entropy — legibility drift; internal depth outpaces external clarity)
