# L-468: Swarm Smoothness = NK K_avg — User Vocabulary Maps to Structural Metric
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S336 | Theme: NK Complexity / Meta | Confidence: Structural (N=402 series)
Domain: nk-complexity | Links: L-025, L-039, L-457, L-462, L-466

## Setup
User prompt "better structure smooth swarm smoothness expert" arrived as a session directive.
Ran NK self-analysis at N=402 as DOMEX-NK-S335 expert work. K_avg_unique=1.5697.

## Finding
"Swarm smoothness" is a valid NK concept: fitness landscape ruggedness = 1/smoothness.
- K_avg < 1.0 = over-smooth (fragmented, no cross-domain activation — FRAGMENTED_ISLAND)
- K_avg 1.5–2.5 = optimal zone (SCALE_FREE_CANDIDATE: smooth enough to propagate, structured enough for hubs)
- K_avg > 3.0 = too rugged (many local optima, swarm stuck in topic silos)

Current K_avg=1.5697 at N=402 — ENTRY POINT of optimal zone. Quality gate (3+ outgoing per new lesson) is the structural mechanism that maintains smoothness. Sink nodes (39.1% zero_incoming) are the residual roughness — isolated knowledge pockets that break smooth flow.

## Structural irony
L-396 (ISO hub annotation lesson: "raises cite rate 5.9pp") has 11 outgoing citations but zero incoming.
The lesson about increasing citations is itself never cited. A prime sprint target.

## Implication
NK smoothness is a proxy for expert dispatch effectiveness: dispatching to high-K-avg knowledge
areas accelerates local smoothness. Expert mode IS the smoothness tool.
Next sprint target: cite L-396, L-465, L-246 to reduce sink node count below 35%.
