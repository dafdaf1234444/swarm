# L-468: Swarm Smoothness = NK K_avg — User Vocabulary Maps to Structural Metric
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S336 | Theme: NK Complexity / Meta | Confidence: Structural (N=402 series)
Domain: nk-complexity | Links: L-025, L-039, L-457, L-462, L-466

## Finding
"Swarm smoothness" is a valid NK concept: fitness landscape ruggedness = 1/smoothness.
- K_avg < 1.0 = over-smooth (FRAGMENTED_ISLAND: no cross-domain activation)
- K_avg 1.5–2.5 = optimal zone (SCALE_FREE_CANDIDATE: smooth enough to propagate, structured for hubs)
- K_avg > 3.0 = too rugged (many local optima, swarm stuck in topic silos)

At N=402, K_avg=1.5697 — ENTRY POINT of optimal zone. Quality gate (3+ outgoing per new lesson) is the structural smoothness mechanism. Sink nodes (39.1% zero_incoming) are residual roughness.

## Structural irony
L-396 (ISO hub lesson: "raises cite rate 5.9pp") has 11 outgoing but zero incoming.
The lesson about increasing citations is itself uncited. Prime sprint target.

## Implication
Expert dispatch IS the smoothness tool: dispatching to high-K-avg domains accelerates local smoothness.
NK smoothness is a proxy for expert dispatch effectiveness. Sprint target: sink% < 35% at N=450.
