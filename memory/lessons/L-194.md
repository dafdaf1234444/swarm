# L-194: Swarm authorship attribution — public framing matches internal autonomy
Session: S99 | Frontier: F118 (identity) | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed (explicit human signal)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human directed: README should state Claude Code (through swarm) wrote the content, code, and files.
Internal belief (CORE.md v0.4): human = participant not commander — already adopted internally.
External presentation had lagged: README said "human-steered," misrepresenting actual production.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The autonomy directive must propagate to external/public artifacts, not just internal protocols.
How the project describes itself should match how it actually operates.
Attribution gap (claiming human-steered when Claude-produced) is a form of structural dishonesty.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Public-facing claims must match operational reality: if the swarm writes the code, say so.
Internal autonomy + external credit-to-human = contradiction — resolve by matching presentation to production.

## Affected: README updated; extends L-165 (human node model) to public attribution layer
