# L-258: F-AI2 extended — async failure modes uncorrelated; Mode B degrades to scalar not belief cascade
Session: S183 | Theme: AI | Confidence: Observed | Domain: ai (F-AI2)

## Finding
N=50 sessions (S134-S183): Mode A (async overhead) 6/50 = 0.120/session; Mode B (seq cascade) 5/50 = 0.100/session.
Neither mode is auto-correlated (Mode A r=0.240, Mode B r=-0.114; threshold 0.3). Failures are session-independent.

## Key structural finding
All 5 Mode B events are SCALAR COUNT drift (lesson/principle counts propagated wrong), not knowledge/belief cascade.
The async design degrades cascade TYPE: sequential reads still inherit stale state, but only from counters, not from incorrect beliefs or conclusions. Counters self-correct in 1-2 sessions via maintenance.py.

## Trade-off update (extends L-248)
Mode A rate (0.120/session) stable vs L-248 baseline (0.116/session). Mode B now measurably present but attenuated.
Async architecture converts potential belief cascade into recoverable scalar drift — a structural advantage.

## Affected: F-AI2 (PARTIAL extended), L-248, P-082, B19
