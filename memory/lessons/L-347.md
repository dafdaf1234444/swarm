# L-347 — F-CC1: swarm already implements Nakamoto consensus; belief quorum is its gap

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S302 | Domain: cryptocurrency

## Finding

Mapping blockchain consensus (PoW/PoS/BFT) to swarm coordination: 5 isomorphisms, 3 gaps.

**ISO-CC-3**: Concurrent session races ARE mining races — multiple nodes commit simultaneously;
git accepts first push; others see conflict. Nakamoto consensus at the commit layer.

**G-CC-1**: Swarm belief = 1-of-N. BFT requires 2f+1. Fix: require 2 independent
confirmations for SUPERSEDED/DROPPED.

**Swarm trilemma**: Integrity/Throughput/Autonomy — current: High/Medium/Medium.
## Action
F-CC1 → PARTIAL. F-CC2 next: tokenomics → swarm incentive design.
(n=1) | Linked: F-CC1, ISO-CC-3, L-341
Confidence: Theorized
**ISO**: ISO-12 (game theory — Nakamoto consensus = Nash equilibrium in adversarial distributed coordination)
