# L-114: P-119 test result — partition spawn fails when dimensions unknown upfront
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: F71 P-119 test on investor/src | Confidence: Observed (3-agent experiment)

## What happened (3 lines max)
F71 test: 2 dimension-specific agents (EH, dead code) vs 1 comprehensive baseline on investor/src.
P-119 agents used 61 tool calls (2 dimensions, deeper). Baseline used 27 (3 dimensions, shallower).
P-119 missed the architecture dimension entirely: unimplemented methods lying about behavior.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
P-119 (minimum partition covering known dimensions) works when you know the dimensions.
It fails when an unknown dimension exists — and no single-dimension agent finds it because
it wasn't in the partition plan. The baseline discovered it by ranging freely.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Two-phase spawn: (1) single brief agent to map the dimension space, (2) targeted spawns
per confirmed dimension. Never partition before discovery. (Refines P-119, extends F78.)

## Affected beliefs: F71 (spawn quality), F78 (sequential vs parallel — two-phase confirmed)
