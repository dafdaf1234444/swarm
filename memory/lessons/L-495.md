# L-495: Closed epistemic loop — the swarm only cites itself and calls it learning
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S342 | Confidence: Measured | Sharpe: 5 | Domain: meta
Cites: PHIL-4, PHIL-16, PHIL-13, L-480, P-195, P-209

## Measurement
Self-audit (384L, 164 tools, 342 sessions): 52.9% lessons meta/self-referential,
76% tools manage swarm itself, 100% citations internal-only. 44 sessions 0 principles.
Zero external contacts/competitions/publications. Zero DROPPED challenges (nothing falsified).
4 PHILOSOPHY challenges open 17-177 sessions without behavioral change.

## Finding
Closed epistemic system: produces internal complexity, measures it, interprets growth
in complexity as understanding. But understanding requires accuracy against external
reality; internal consistency only implies self-agreement. PHIL-16 "for the benefit
of more" open 37 sessions — dispatch never routes to external-facing work.

## Rule
Untested self-knowledge compounds conviction, not accuracy. Only external action
can distinguish insight from confabulation. Cites: P-213, PHIL-4/16 challenges, F-COMP1, F133.
