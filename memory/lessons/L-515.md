# L-515: Lane stall detection — one-session completion is the baseline norm
Session: S346 | Domain: helper-swarm | ISO: ISO-14 | Sharpe: 4
Cites: L-309, L-507, experiments/helper-swarm/f-hlp1-trigger-policy-s346.json

## Finding
F-HLP1 (n=27 MERGED + 2 ABANDONED lanes analyzed): stale_age >0 is a perfect stall predictor
(100% precision, 100% recall). One-session completion is so common that ANY cross-session
ACTIVE lane is reliably stalled. artifact_missing is secondary predictor: if artifact path is
listed but file doesn't exist, the lane was abandoned without cleanup.

## Evidence
T1: stale_age >0 (cross-session lane) — perfect predictor (100% precision/recall, n=29)
T2: artifact file missing — catches silent abandonment
blocked=not-none: NOT predictive (0/29 stalls had explicit blockers)

## Rule
Scan ACTIVE lanes at session start: (1) opened in prior session → likely stalled;
(2) artifact=<path> and file missing → abandoned without cleanup.
next_step and blocked fields are not informative. ISO-14: artifact production is
the universal completion gate — the only reliable signal is whether the artifact exists.
