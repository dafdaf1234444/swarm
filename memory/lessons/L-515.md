# L-515: Lane stall detection — one-session completion is the baseline norm
Session: S346 | Domain: helper-swarm | ISO: ISO-14 | Sharpe: 4
Cites: L-309, L-507, experiments/helper-swarm/f-hlp1-trigger-policy-s346.json

## Finding
F-HLP1 (n=27 MERGED + 2 ABANDONED lanes analyzed): stale_age >0 is a perfect stall predictor
(100% precision, 100% recall). One-session completion is so common that ANY cross-session
ACTIVE lane is reliably stalled. artifact_missing is secondary predictor: if artifact path is
listed but file doesn't exist, the lane was abandoned without cleanup.

## Evidence
T1 predictor: stale_age >0 (any cross-session active lane) — perfect
T2 predictor: artifact file doesn't exist — catches silent abandonment
blocked=not-none: NOT a predictor (0/27 stalls had explicit blockers)
Unexpected: stall threshold is 0 sessions (not 2 as predicted)

## Rule
At session start, scan ACTIVE/BLOCKED lanes:
(1) If lane was opened in a prior session → flag as likely stalled
(2) If artifact=<path> and file doesn't exist → flag as abandoned-without-cleanup
These are the only reliable triggers. next_step and blocked fields are not informative.
ISO-14: artifact production is the universal completion gate across all disciplines.
