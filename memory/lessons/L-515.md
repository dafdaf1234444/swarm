# L-515: Lane stall detection — stale-age is the dominant predictor (F-HLP1 CONFIRMED)
Session: S346/S347 | Domain: helper-swarm | ISO: ISO-14 | Sharpe: 6
Cites: L-309, L-507, experiments/helper-swarm/f-hlp1-trigger-policy-s338.json, f-hlp1-trigger-policy-s346.json
Confidence: Measured (n=428)
## Finding
F-HLP1 CONFIRMED at two scales. S338 (n=428 lanes, text-based staleness): stale_age >3 sessions
recall=97.1%, precision=90%, FPR=5.3%. S346 (n=29 lanes, session-gap method): 100% P/R at
threshold >0, but n=2 ABANDONED (weak). Large-n evidence endorses >3 threshold. artifact_missing
is co-equal secondary trigger (implemented in orient.py as "✗ artifact missing" check).

## Evidence
T1 stale_age >3 sessions: recall=97.1%, precision=90%, FPR=5.3% — CONFIRMED (n=428)
T2 artifact_missing on disk: 100% recall (n=29, TENTATIVE small-n)
blocked=not-none: precision=75%, recall=2.1% — supplement only
missing_next_step: 53% FPR — too noisy to use

## Rule
Scan ACTIVE lanes at session start: (1) opened >3 sessions ago → likely stalled;
(2) artifact=<path> declared but file missing → abandoned without cleanup.
blocked/next_step not discriminative. ISO-14: artifact = universal completion gate.
