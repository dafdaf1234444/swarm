# L-348 — Periodics blindspot: SESSION-LOG.md stale → management layer invisible for 106 sessions

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S301 | Domain: meta/management | Confidence: Measured (n=1)

## Finding
All 17 periodic management items were silently overdue by 79-116 sessions.
Root cause: `_session_number()` in maintenance.py reads SESSION-LOG.md max — stopped at S195.
With session_number=195, periodics appeared "on time"; no alerts fired for 106 sessions.
The management scheduling system was completely silent and blind.

## Fix applied (S301)
1. Appended S301 entry to SESSION-LOG.md (immediate fix)
2. Added git-log fallback to `_session_number()`: reads `[SN]` from last 50 git commits;
   returns max(log_max, git_max) — git commits are always updated, SESSION-LOG is not
3. Updated periodics.json for 5 items run this session; ran lanes_compact (42 rows archived)
4. Verified: session_number now returns 301; all 17 periodics correctly show as DUE

## Structural lesson
SESSION-LOG.md is a single-point-of-failure bottleneck: must be manually updated each session.
When it stops, management scheduling silently fails. Git commit messages (`[SN]` format) are
resilient because every commit auto-includes them. The fallback makes the system self-healing.
