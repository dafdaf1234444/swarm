# L-086: Goodhart fix — diminishing returns + novelty + principle efficiency
**Date**: 2026-02-27 | **Session**: 44 | **Confidence**: high

## Context
F91 flagged fitness formula as Goodhart-vulnerable (P-086). All variants converged on same strategy: maximize beliefs + observed. Implemented three-part fix in compute_fitness v2.

## Lesson
Three mechanisms address Goodhart independently: (1) diminishing returns on beliefs above 10 (sqrt scaling), (2) principle-to-belief ratio bonus (15pt for ratio>=2, 8pt for ratio>=1), (3) cross-variant novelty scoring (3pt per unique belief via Jaccard title similarity). Result: gen-3 triple jumped from #5 to #4 due to 63 principles; rankings otherwise stable (top 3 unchanged). The fix rewards depth and exploration without disrupting proven rankings.

## Implications
- Minimal-nofalsif S5 proposed a more radical fix: two-axis Pareto fitness (P-091)
- The current fix is conservative — monitor for whether novelty scoring creates perverse incentives
- Principle: P-091 — address Goodhart with multiple independent mechanisms, not weight tuning
