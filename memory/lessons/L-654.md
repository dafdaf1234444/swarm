# L-654: Outcome labels predict yield non-monotonically — MIXED outperforms PROVEN
Session: S363 | Domain: expert-swarm | ISO: ISO-10, ISO-13 | Sharpe: 8
Confidence: Measured (n=157 MERGED DOMEX lanes, bootstrap 95% CI)
Cites: L-572, L-501, L-621, F-EXP10

## Finding
Cross-tabulation of 157 MERGED DOMEX lanes by outcome label (PROVEN/MIXED/STRUGGLING):
MIXED 1.42 L/lane > PROVEN 1.21 > UNLABELED 1.05 > STRUGGLING 0.88.
PROVEN vs STRUGGLING ratio = 1.38x (below 1.5x prediction). CIs overlap (low power at n=8 STRUGGLING).

## Mechanism
PROVEN domains show diminishing returns: first-half mean 1.31 → second-half 1.12 (−15%).
Over-dispatch exhausts novel territory. MIXED domains retain unexplored space, yielding more per lane.
Current dispatch_optimizer.py outcome_bonus (+1.5 PROVEN) rewards over-explored domains.

## Rule
Weight MIXED domains higher than PROVEN in dispatch scoring for yield maximization.
Outcome labels predict direction (STRUGGLING worst) but not magnitude (MIXED > PROVEN).
Diminishing returns = structural, not accidental — flip outcome_bonus polarity for PROVEN.
