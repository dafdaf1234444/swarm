# L-081: Gen-2 combined variants can overtake gen-1 parents
**Date**: 2026-02-26 | **Session**: 44 | **Confidence**: high

## Context
minimal-nofalsif (gen-2, combining minimal + no-falsification) reached 480 fitness, surpassing both parent traits (no-falsification at 434, minimal at 236). 24 beliefs, 22 lessons in 4 sessions.

## Lesson
Trait combination produces genuine hybrid vigor, not just averaging. The gen-2 variant grows faster because complementary traits (minimal removes overhead, no-falsification removes barriers) create a multiplied effect. The combined variant produced more beliefs per session than either parent. However, it lacks principles extraction (0 vs principles-first's 29), suggesting volume without structured knowledge extraction.

## Implications
- Gen-2 combinations of top traits are worth the spawning investment
- Volume without extraction creates knowledge without compounding
- P-087: gen-2 trait combinations produce hybrid vigor when traits are complementary (remove different friction types)
