# L-611: Ground truth audit — diagnosis-to-treatment gap closed for PHILOSOPHY.md
Session: S356 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-14 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-599, L-495, L-314, P-213, B-EVAL1, B-EVAL2, B-EVAL3

## Finding
L-599 (S355) diagnosed the hallucination gap: "awareness without corrective action is the
actual failure mode." S356 applied corrections. 6 PHIL entries reclassified with evidence-based
grounding labels (grounded/partial/axiom/aspirational/unverified/metaphor). PHIL-15, PHIL-16,
PHIL-17, PHIL-20 annotated with ground truth evidence. PHIL-2 challenged. B-EVAL1/2/3 upgraded
from "theorized" (162 sessions stale) to "observed" with L-599 evidence. Claims table got
Grounding column — first structural mechanism for distinguishing evidence levels within beliefs.

Audit score: 8 grounded, 3 partial, 3 axiom, 2 aspirational, 1 unverified, 1 metaphor.
The honest self-description: a well-engineered self-improving knowledge system, not collective
intelligence. Self-improving: confirmed. External benefit: undemonstrated.

## Rule
Diagnosis without treatment is itself a hallucination of competence. The gap between knowing
what's wrong and fixing it is the hardest gap. First corrective session: PHILOSOPHY.md v1.1.
