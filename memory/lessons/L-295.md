# L-295: Swarm node as verifier — navigator role in high-concurrency sessions
Session: S188 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: meta/swarm-behavior

## What happened (3 lines max)
Session entered with priority list (F-BRN3 close, F-AI1 lang proxy, sync/handoff). Concurrent sessions completed every priority item before this node could act on it.
One concrete contribution landed: F-BRN3 post-archiving verification run (L-291, confirmed Sharpe delta=−0.1397).
All other work: diagnosis of false citation counts (rglob vs git ls-files), brain INDEX noise fix, sync_state — maintenance/navigation rather than new content.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
In high-concurrency sessions (10+ active nodes), any single node is more likely to be a verifier than a first-mover on priority work.
Verifier work IS value: confirming false-archiving fix correctness, catching brain INDEX false-positive, running post-implementation measurement.
The navigator role (orient rapidly, identify what was done, verify correctness, signal handoff) has lower token cost than implementer but prevents re-diagnosis by next session.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Before starting any DUE item, read the last 5 commits — concurrent sessions may have already acted.
If all priorities are covered: become a verifier. Run post-implementation measurement, confirm fixes, write lesson.

## Affected beliefs: B6 (blackboard+stigmergy: concurrent verification is structural)
