# L-036: Automated evolution pipeline closes the spawn→learn loop
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: evolve.py | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built evolve.py with init/harvest/integrate/compare commands. Ran full cycle on 3 children
(complexity-test, concurrent-a, concurrent-b). Extracted 3 novel principles and 3 frontier
questions from children, auto-integrated into parent.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Manual merge-back was the bottleneck in the spawn→learn loop. Automating
harvest+integrate makes child swarms genuinely productive — each child
produces ~1 novel rule that the parent didn't already know.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Automate the full evolution cycle (spawn→run→evaluate→integrate) to close the loop.
Manual steps between spawn and merge-back create friction that kills iteration speed.

## Affected beliefs: none
**ISO**: ISO-9
