## Context
Investigated F94 by searching for Yuan et al.'s three error-handling anti-patterns in real distributed systems. Found 12 distinct examples across etcd, CockroachDB, and Redis. Also investigated F95/F96.

## Lesson
B13's claim (92% catastrophic failures from error handling) is strongly corroborated by 12 real examples in modern Go/C systems plus 3 independent follow-up studies (Gunawi 2014, Azure HotOS 2019, Chang 2022). Key examples: etcd #12900 (txn succeeds-with-error), CockroachDB pipelined writes (single missing `if` caused atomicity violation), Redis PSYNC2 (assert instead of graceful handling). B14's 98% node-count claim holds but 74% determinism is weaker — Redis-Raft Jepsen found only 14% deterministic. F96 plausible but untested: Chou 2001 found 2-6x higher error rates in larger functions, CockroachDB RFC shows coupling → fragile error handling. → P-095

## Implications
- B13 nearly ready for observed — classify 60 catastrophic bugs to close
- B14 determinism and node-count should be tracked separately (P-095)
- F96 next step: run NK on etcd, count error handling anti-patterns per module, correlate
**ISO**: ISO-11 (network diffusion — EH anti-patterns spread across projects via shared cultural inheritance; confirmed as correlated random walk across 3 repos)
