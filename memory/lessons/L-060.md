# L-060: First real spawn loop closed with Claude Code Task tool
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: NK stdlib spawn (S42) | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Used Claude Code Task tool to spawn 3 parallel agents (unittest, argparse, logging NK analysis). All 3 completed independently, wrote findings to files, found novel insights. No coordination failures. Total time: ~4 min for all 3 concurrent.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Task tool IS the spawn mechanism — no custom agent_swarm.py needed. Each agent gets a clear prompt + access to tools. Results come back structured. The swarm's spawn infrastructure was over-engineered; native tooling suffices.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
For spawn tasks: use Task tool with clear prompts over custom spawn infrastructure. Custom tools add value only for features Task tool lacks (history tracking, quality scoring).

## Affected beliefs: none
**ISO**: ISO-14 (recursive self-similarity — spawn loop closed = protocol applied to itself; Task tool IS the swarm's self-spawning mechanism)
