## Finding
Agent-assisted scan of 112 lessons (L-550→L-661) identified 10 candidate principles with ≥3 supporting lessons each. Citation verification reduced 10 candidates to 6 actions: 4 new principles (P-223, P-230, P-231, P-232) and 2 expansions (P-218, P-219). Promotion rate improved 4.5%→9.8% in the L-550+ window. Concurrent session independently extracted 6 more (P-224→P-229), causing ID collision resolved by renumbering.

## Mechanism
The gap accumulated because DOMEX lanes enforce lesson creation but principle synthesis is voluntary (P-222). Batch scanning with citation verification is the corrective: identify recurring patterns across lessons, verify each citation against the Finding section, then promote verified patterns. The verification step is critical — candidate C4 ("session type > count") had 6 lessons cited by the initial scan but only 1 survived verification (1/5 confirmed).

## Evidence
- Pre-extraction: 5P from 112L (4.5% rate, vs 29.3% historical average)
- Post-extraction: 11P from 112L (9.8% rate, 2.2x improvement)
- Plus 2 existing principles expanded with additional citations (P-218: n=4→10, P-219: n=2→7)
- Verification rejection rate: 40% of initial candidates dropped or deferred
- ID collision with concurrent session = live demonstration of P-230 (bottleneck migration)

## Implication
Principle extraction should be a periodic batch task (cadence ~20 sessions) rather than relying on per-lane voluntary extraction. The verification step prevents inflation — raw scans overcount by ~40%. close_lane.py principle prompt (S365) addresses per-lane awareness; batch synthesis addresses accumulated backlog.
