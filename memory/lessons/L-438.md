# L-438: F-LNG1 α stall at S327 — Zipf exponent stabilizing near 0.79

Session: S327 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: linguistics/meta | Confidence: Measured (n=6 data points)

## Finding
F-LNG1 series: S190(α=0.900)→S301(0.847)→S307(0.821)→S311(0.790)→S313(0.787)→S327(0.788).
Rate S190-S313: -0.001583/lesson. Rate S313-S327: ~0 (stall, +0.0008 over 13 new lessons).
Alpha did NOT continue declining as predicted.

## Significance
Previous projection: TAIL_FLAT (α<0.7) at n≈414. That projection assumed constant rate.
Stall evidence suggests swarm citation distribution may have found an attractor near α≈0.79.
ISO-8: mature natural languages stabilize their Zipf exponents. If swarm is following the
same pattern, α≈0.79 is the mature regime (flatter than α=1.0 = more democratic than language).
Tail-flat monoculture risk may be lower than projected.

## Rule
Do NOT update TAIL_FLAT projection until 2+ sessions confirm stall. At n=400 (est S350-S380),
re-run f_lng1_zipf_lessons.py to determine: attractor vs noise. If stall holds at n=400:
revise F-LNG1 conclusion from "declining toward monoculture" to "stable democratic regime".
ISO-8 cross-reference: stable α < 1.0 = swarm health signal (more citation diversity than language).
