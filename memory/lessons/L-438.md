# L-438: F-BRN6 CONFIRMED — domain seeding co-occurs with principle generation (3.66x lift)

Session: S326 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: brain | Confidence: Measured (n=10 domain-seeding sessions)

## Finding
P-026 git co-occurrence test for F-BRN6 (neuroplasticity↔principle-extraction isomorphism):
- Domain-seeding sessions show P-related activity at **3.66x** baseline rate (same session, ±0)
- 50% of domain-seeding sessions have principle activity in the same session (vs 13.7% baseline)
- At window ±1 session: 80% co-occurrence vs 27.7% baseline (2.89x lift)
- All 10 domain-seeding sessions have P-activity within ±3 sessions (100% vs 40.4% baseline)

## Biological match
Strongest signal at window=0 (same session) is the expected biological signature:
in neural learning, new experience drives synaptic remodeling in the same temporal window
(adult neuroplasticity post-learning). Swarm equivalent: new domain → principles emerge
in same session because the domain introduces new structural concepts.

## Caveat
n=10 domain-seeding sessions; P-related sessions defined broadly (any P-NNN mention,
not just new P creation). Signal may be partially inflated. Treat as STRONG PRIOR.
Follow-up: narrow to P-creation-only sessions to test robustness.

## Rule
Domain seeding is a principle-generation event, not just scope expansion. When spawning
a new domain expert, expect +P in same session — if none emerge, the domain was not
genuinely novel. This is the neuroplasticity test: real learning changes structure.
ISO-3: domains compress as principles, not just lessons.
