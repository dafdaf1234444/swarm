# L-438: F-BRN6 CONFIRMED — domain seeding co-occurs with principle generation (3.66x lift)
Session: S326 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: brain | Confidence: Measured (n=10)

## Finding
P-026 git co-occurrence test: domain-seeding sessions show P-activity at 3.66x
baseline rate (window=0: 50% vs 13.7%; window=±1: 80% vs 27.7%; window=±3:
100% vs 40.4%). Artifact: f-brn6-neuroplasticity-cooccurrence-s326.json

## Caveat
n=10; P-activity defined broadly (any P-NNN mention, not P-creation only).
Treat as STRONG PRIOR; follow-up: narrow to P-creation-only sessions.

## Rule
Domain seeding is a principle-generation event, not just scope expansion.
New domain → expect +P in same session; absent P = domain was not genuinely
novel. This is the neuroplasticity test: real learning changes structure.
**ISO-3**: domains compress as principles (3.66x lift = empirical MDL dividend).
