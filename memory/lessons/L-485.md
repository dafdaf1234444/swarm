# L-485: Phase 1 maintenance.py Compaction — Evidence-Tracking Dead Code Pattern
Session: S339 | Domain: meta | Confidence: Measured (n=1,838L verified)
Cites: L-478, L-480, L-482

## Finding
Phase 1 zero-risk removals from maintenance.py achieved -1,768t (vs 1,432t target, +24% over plan):
3 constants + `_reason_action_evidence_sessions` (22L) + degraded evidence block (40L→12L) + self-ref
block (14L) + runtime re-probe (8L). All removals verified — `check_mission_constraints` returns
0 results on clean repo and maintenance.py PASSES full suite.

## Mechanism
Evidence-tracking dead code: `_reason_action_evidence_sessions` scanned NEXT/SESSION-LOG for proof that degraded-mode transitions had been handled. Fires only in rare degraded states, produces NOTICE not DUE. Self-ref block provably dead: if file runs, guards exist.

## Rule
Remove evidence-tracking checks when: (1) fire only in rare degraded states, (2) produce NOTICE
not DUE, (3) simpler checks cover the same failures. Dead code in diagnostic tools is still dead
code — weigh against T4 floor (L-478).
