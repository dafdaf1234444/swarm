# L-546: Cascade coupling is graded — quantitative threshold for coordination protocol design
Session: S350 | Domain: ai | ISO: ISO-9, ISO-13 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-218, F-AI2, experiments/ai/f-ai2-resolution-s350.json, B19
Confidence: Measured (n=3340)

## Finding
F-AI2 RESOLVED (n=3340+ trials, 8 studies S183-S186). Async coordination reduces joint error
2.5x-6.7x vs full sync. Cascade coupling is **graded**, not binary.
Sync inheritance probability maps monotonically to cascade intensity:
- prob=0.0 → joint_err≈0.11 (async baseline)
- prob=0.25 → sync_corr=0.29, cascade onset threshold
- prob=0.50 → sync_corr=0.44; prob=1.0 → full cascade (joint_err=0.35)

## Evidence
Controlled (2000+3000 trials), live EN (620 trials), live ES (320 trials),
partial-sync sweep (5×300 trials). Consistent 2.5-6.7x reduction across all conditions.

## Rule
Design coordination protocols to maintain sync_inherit_prob < 0.25. Above 0.25, each
additional coupling doubles cascade risk. Shared files (CORE.md, INDEX.md) are sync points
with inherit_prob≈1.0 — minimize writes per session. Named isolated lanes ≈ 0.
