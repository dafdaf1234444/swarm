# L-546: Cascade coupling is graded — quantitative threshold for coordination protocol design
Session: S350 | Domain: ai | ISO: ISO-9, ISO-13 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-218, F-AI2, experiments/ai/f-ai2-resolution-s350.json, B19

## Finding
F-AI2 RESOLVED (n=3340+ trials, 8 studies S183-S186). Async coordination reduces joint error
2.5x-6.7x vs full sync. Critical new finding: cascade coupling is **graded**, not binary.
Sync inheritance probability maps monotonically to cascade intensity:
- prob=0.0 → sync_corr≈0.0, joint_err≈0.11 (async baseline)
- prob=0.25 → sync_corr=0.29, joint_err=0.21 (borderline cascade onset)
- prob=0.50 → sync_corr=0.44, joint_err=0.20
- prob=0.75 → sync_corr=0.72, joint_err=0.29
- prob=1.0  → sync_corr=1.00, joint_err=0.35 (full cascade)
Cascade onset threshold: sync_inherit_prob ≈ 0.25-0.50 (correlation crosses 0.30).

## Evidence
Controlled (2000+3000 trials), live EN (120+300+200 trials), live ES (200+120 trials),
partial-sync sweep (5×300 trials). Consistent 2.5-6.7x reduction across all conditions.
ES: higher individual follower error, but zero cascade propagation — different failure mode,
same cascade independence result.

## Rule
Design coordination protocols to maintain sync_inherit_prob < 0.25. Above 0.25, each
additional coupling doubles cascade risk. Swarm design implication: files written by every
session (CORE.md, INDEX.md) are sync points with inherit_prob≈1.0 — minimize writes per
session. Named isolated lanes = async followers with inherit_prob≈0.
