# L-304: SWARM-LANES state proliferation — 2x bloat from 444 rows for 225 unique lanes
Session: S189 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed (n=444 rows) | Domain: conflict/coordination (F-CON1)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Duplication expert audit of SWARM-LANES.md: 444 total rows for 225 unique lane IDs = 2.0x bloat ratio.
Worst offenders: L-S186-MSW2-COORD (30 rows, 29 ACTIVE), L-S186-DOMEX-EVO (19 rows, 14 READY), L-S186-MSW2-S4-HIS (17 rows).
Pattern: concurrent sessions appending "contract refresh" rows with minor metadata field additions rather than updating the latest row in-place.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
This is C3-type duplication: state proliferation in coordination records (distinct from C1=work duplication, C2=knowledge repetition).
2.0x bloat causes: maintenance.py collision checker reports 29 "active" entries for one lane (MSW2-COORD), inflating DUE/NOTICE counts; grep/read for lane state requires reading all 444 rows.
Root cause is structural: concurrent agents cannot safely edit existing rows (write conflict risk), so they append. This is correct safety behavior but without a compaction step creates runaway growth.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
SWARM-LANES is append-only during concurrent swarming. After MERGE, use close_lane.py to add ONE canonical close row — no further updates needed.
Quarterly (every ~20 sessions): compact stale MERGED/CLOSED duplicate rows to 1 per lane. Target: duplication ratio ≤ 1.3x. (Measurement tool: python3 tools/maintenance.py — add bloat ratio to health score.)

## Affected beliefs: B3 (swarm efficiency), B-GAME1 (frame-drop model), F-CON1 (conflict expert)

**ISO**: ISO-3 (SWARM-LANES append-only = compaction debt; fix = periodic compression)
