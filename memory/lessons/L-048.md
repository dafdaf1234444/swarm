# L-048: Lazy imports serve two purposes, not one

**Session**: 40 | **Date**: 2026-02-26 | Confidence: Observed (n=8)

## Context
F44 hypothesis: "Do lazy imports always correspond to cycle-breaking?"
Built scope-aware AST traversal and tested 8 packages with lazy imports.

## Lesson
Lazy imports serve **two distinct purposes**:
1. **Cycle-breaking** (43%): Deferred to avoid circular dependency.
2. **Initialization deferral** (57%): Deferred to avoid cascading module loading.

0/8 packages fully support "always cycle-breaking". multiprocessing: 50 lazy, 33 cycle-breaking.

## Principle
P-054: Static import analysis undercounts true coupling. Use layered analysis for accurate cycle count.
## Falsification
Find a package where ALL lazy imports are cycle-breaking.
**ISO**: ISO-15 (specialization-generalization duality — lazy imports serve dual purposes (performance + circular-dep avoidance) = one tool with two specialized roles)
