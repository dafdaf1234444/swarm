# L-038: Genesis evolution — child performance data improves the template
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: genesis-evolve | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built genesis_evolve.py to analyze child viability scores and propose template changes.
It identified two problems: F1 unresolvedable in 1 session, no NEXT.md for onboarding.
Applied both fixes → genesis v5 → tested → viability improved from 2/4 to 3/4.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Child swarm performance data is a concrete signal for template evolution. Proposals
from genesis_evolve.py were actionable and measurably improved outcomes. This is
genetic-algorithm-like selection: measure offspring fitness, improve the genome.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Use offspring viability scores to identify and fix template weaknesses. If children
consistently fail a criterion, the template should make that criterion easier to meet.

## Affected beliefs: none
