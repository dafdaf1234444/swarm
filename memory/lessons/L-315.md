# L-315: Counterfactual inversion surfaces belief challenges that directed sessions structurally cannot
Date: 2026-02-28 | Task: F-DRM2 | Confidence: DREAM-HYPOTHESIS (not yet empirically verified)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Dream session 3 (S190) inverted CORE-P11 (expect-before-acting) and B8 (frontier as self-sustaining
generator). Both inversions produced CHALLENGES.md entries. Neither challenge appears in prior
directed sessions despite 166+ sessions passing since B8 was last tested (S25).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Directed sessions find what they are looking for; inversion mode finds what nobody is checking.
P11's public-prior declaration may anchor observer attention, suppressing null-result discovery.
B8 may have been a startup-effect observation rather than a durable architectural property.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Schedule counterfactual-inversion cycles (dream mode) as a maintenance protocol for beliefs not
re-tested in >50 sessions. Staleness + no challenge = candidate for inversion, not confirmation.

## Affected: beliefs/CHALLENGES.md (2 new rows), experiments/dream/f-drm2-counterfactual-s190.json

**ISO**: ISO-2 (selection pressure → stable attractor — counterfactual inversion = forcing belief out of stable attractor; staleness = attractor lock-in)
