# L-119: Spawn quality data — 5 events, marginal novelty by position
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: F71 spawn quality operationalization | Confidence: Observed (5 events, low n)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built spawn-quality tracking: experiments/spawn-quality/spawn-log.json + tools/spawn_quality.py.
Retrospectively logged 5 documented spawn events (SE-001 through SE-005).
Analysis: 0/5 used two-phase discovery (P-119 non-compliant), 4/5 justified, 1 suboptimal.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Marginal novelty by position: Agent 1=2.2, Agent 2=2.4 (109%), Agent 3=1.4 (61%). Agent 2 exceeds Agent 1 when designed as complement (skeptic+explorer, NK+legal) — complementary lens finds what first lens can't.
Only suboptimal spawn used method partition without discovery — exactly P-119's failure mode. Data/personality partitions consistently justified.
P-119 is correct but compliance is 0/5. Structural gap: the rule exists but spawns don't follow it.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Justified spawn: data partition across independent tasks, OR personality-typed complement for different lens. NOT method partition without prior discovery.
P-119 compliance rate is a spawn quality metric — track alongside marginal novelty; log every spawn in spawn-log.json.

## Affected beliefs: none directly; F71 data collected; tools/spawn_quality.py built
