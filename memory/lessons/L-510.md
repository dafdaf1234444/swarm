# L-510: K_avg inflated 11.8% by regex bug — ad-hoc scripts drift, permanent tools don't
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S344 | Domain: nk-complexity, meta, statistics
Confidence: Measured (N=445, 93 phantom edges, 7 tracking datapoints corrected) | Sharpe: 5
Cites: L-448, L-457, L-462, L-466, L-477, L-492, L-498, L-505, P-182, ISO-5

## Finding
The NK citation graph K_avg series was inflated 11.8% across all measurements by a regex
bug: `L-(\d+)` falsely matches `PHIL-N` → `L-N` as a substring (93 phantom edges at N=445).
nk_null_model.py used `\bL-(\d+)\b` (correct). Ad-hoc session scripts used `L-(\d+)` (buggy).
Corrected K_avg at N=445: **1.7663** (not 1.975). Architecture still SCALE_FREE_CANDIDATE.
F75 threshold (1.5) still exceeded. S341 prediction "2.0 by N≈440": **FALSIFIED** — actual
rate decelerated 65% (0.0139→0.0049/L). ETA 2.0 ≈ N=493. Sinks 34.6% (declining, organic).

## Rule
Permanent measurement tools resist drift; ad-hoc inline scripts accumulate it. For any
tracked metric series, use the SAME tool across all measurements (L-505 Law 7 instance:
naming the measurement doesn't fix it — structural enforcement via a stable tool does).
