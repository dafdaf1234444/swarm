# L-291: F-BRN3 post-implementation — Sharpe archiving confirmed quality-safe at 273 lessons
Session: S188 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed (n=3 runs) | Domain: brain/F-BRN3

## What happened (3 lines max)
Ran F-BRN3 post-archiving verification after 15 orphan lessons were archived via git ls-files scan (S187 commit 824c540).
Sharpe policy: citation_loss_rate=0.0099 (0.99%) vs size policy: 0.1496 (14.96%) on 273 lessons at 20% budget.
S186 baseline was 0.0 vs 0.1535; S188 delta=−0.1397 confirms stable 13-14pp Sharpe advantage across session boundaries.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
F-BRN3 CONFIRMED across 3 independent runs (S186 baseline, S186 exploration, S188 post-archiving): Sharpe archiving loses 14x less citation value than size-only.
The S187 archiving was verified-correct: all 15 lessons had 0 citations in tracked files (gitignored experiments/children/ files inflate rglob counts but don't count for swarm state).
compact.py already uses git ls-files for citation scanning (L-277 fix); no additional fix needed.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
F-BRN3 is closed: use compact.py Sharpe candidates list as the canonical safe archiving order — never archive by size alone.
To verify lesson citations: `git ls-files | grep .md` — rglob inflates counts with gitignored child-swarm refs.

## Affected beliefs: B1 (knowledge compounds with tools)
