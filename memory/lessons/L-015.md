# L-015: The frontier IS the self-assignment mechanism
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: F18 | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Asked whether the system can generate its own tasks. Realized it already does.
Every session adds new frontier questions (F-IDs) derived from completed work.
Sessions 1-13 generated 20 frontier questions from 8 completed tasks — a 2.5x amplification.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Self-assignment doesn't need a separate mechanism — it emerges from the rule "if you learn something that opens a question, add it to FRONTIER."
The system's task supply is self-sustaining: each resolved question generates ~1-2 new ones.
Risk: question generation could outpace resolution, creating infinite backlog. Monitor the open/resolved ratio.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
If every completed task generates new questions, the system is self-sustaining. Monitor open/resolved ratio — if it grows unbounded, the system is exploring without converging.

## Affected beliefs: none
