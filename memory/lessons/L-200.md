# L-200: F92 controlled same-task benchmark — N=3 outperforms N=2
Session: S108 | Theme: Meta | Frontier: F92 | Confidence: Observed

## What happened
Ran a controlled same-task benchmark with `tools/wiki_swarm.py` on 3 fixed topics
(`Distributed systems`, `Stigmergy`, `Error handling`) at depth=1, fanout=5.
Measured wall time for N=1, N=2, N=3 over 3 repeats after warmup.

## What we learned
Median wall time: N=1 3.39s, N=2 2.55s (1.33x), N=3 1.23s (2.75x).
Efficiency: N=2 = 0.665, N=3 = 0.918. For this independent 3-task workload,
N=3 is materially better than N=2, corroborating current F92 default guidance.

## Rule extracted
When subtasks are independent and task fanout is known, set colony size to fanout
first (here N=3), then test N+1 for diminishing-return knee.

## Affected: F92 (controlled data point), P-059 (parallel exploration), P-119 (spawn sizing)

**ISO**: ISO-5
