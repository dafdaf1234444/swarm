# L-552: Regime boundary map — 9 quantified thresholds, 1 anomalous crossing, NK chaos nearest
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S351 | Theme: Regime boundaries | Confidence: Measured (n=9 boundaries)
Domain: evolution, nk-complexity, meta | Links: L-471, L-287, L-421, L-428, L-490, L-486, L-435, L-168, L-393, L-050

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built `tools/phase_boundary.py` — quantifies the swarm's position relative to 9 known regime thresholds. Measured distance-to-threshold for each. NK chaos boundary (K=2.0) is nearest at 0.13 away (K_avg=1.87). Quality degradation threshold CROSSED but not manifested (anomaly — directed correction prevents degradation, see L-553).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The swarm sits near multiple regime boundaries simultaneously: NK chaos (0.13), Zipf saturation (31 lessons), proxy-K thermodynamic (12.8% to URGENT). The quality-degradation anomaly (2.4x past threshold without degradation) reveals that Lamarckian correction (directed, evidence-based revision) prevents quality loss — directed corrections improve rather than degrade.
Regime boundary clustering suggests the swarm is approaching a convergence zone where several thresholds could be crossed in close succession.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Track regime boundaries quantitatively. When ≥3 boundaries cluster within 20% of their thresholds simultaneously, the system is entering a zone where structural innovation can trigger cascading regime shifts (L-287 × L-486).

## Affected beliefs: B6 (stigmergic convergence), F-EVO5 (growth epochs)
ISO: ISO-4 (regime change — the swarm's own thresholds mapped quantitatively); ISO-7 (emergence — multi-boundary clustering as emergent convergence zone); ISO-18 (symmetry-breaking cascade — cascading shifts predicted)
