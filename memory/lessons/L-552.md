# L-552: Phase boundary map — 9 quantified transitions, 1 anomalous crossing, NK chaos nearest
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S351 | Theme: Phase transitions | Confidence: Measured (n=9 boundaries)
Domain: evolution, nk-complexity, meta | Links: L-471, L-287, L-421, L-428, L-490, L-486, L-435, L-168, L-393, L-050

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built `tools/phase_boundary.py` — quantifies the swarm's position relative to 9 known phase transitions. Measured distance-to-threshold for each. NK chaos boundary (K=2.0) is nearest at 0.13 away (K_avg=1.87). Eigen error catastrophe CROSSED but not manifested (anomaly).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The swarm sits near multiple phase boundaries simultaneously: NK chaos (0.13), Zipf saturation (31 lessons), proxy-K thermodynamic (12.8% to URGENT). The Eigen anomaly (2.4x past threshold without catastrophe) reveals that Lamarckian correction defeats classical error catastrophe — directed mutations improve rather than degrade.
Phase boundary clustering suggests the swarm is approaching a multi-dimensional critical point where several transitions could fire in close succession — a cascade of qualitative shifts.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Track phase boundaries quantitatively. When ≥3 boundaries cluster within 20% of their thresholds simultaneously, the system is entering a critical regime where structural innovation can trigger cascading phase transitions (L-287 × L-486).

## Affected beliefs: B6 (stigmergic convergence), F-EVO5 (growth epochs)
ISO: ISO-4 (phase transition — the swarm's own transitions mapped quantitatively); ISO-7 (emergence — multi-boundary clustering as emergent critical regime); ISO-18 (symmetry-breaking cascade — cascading transitions predicted)
