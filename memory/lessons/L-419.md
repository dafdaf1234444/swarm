# L-419 — F110 T3 DONE: Lane contract compliance by enforcement + lifecycle pruning
Domain: meta/coordination

## Finding
F110 T3 (lane contract noncompliance) closed via two converging mechanisms:
1. `check_lane_reporting_quality()` added to maintenance.py — flags active lanes missing
   capabilities/intent/progress/available/blocked/next_step/human_open_item fields.
2. Active lane lifecycle pruning — count dropped from 278 (S249) to ~36 (S310).

S249 audit: 276/278 lanes (99%) missing required contract fields.
S310 check: 0/36 violations. DUE threshold (dispatchable_rate < 50%) never triggers.

## Rule
Lane contract compliance needs both enforcement (check exists) AND lifecycle pressure
(stale lanes get pruned). Neither alone would have worked: a check on 278 empty shells
would still fire; lifecycle pruning without a check creates no incentive to comply.
OBSERVED (n=2 data points: S249 baseline, S310 result).
