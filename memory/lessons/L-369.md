# L-369 — Predictive coding ↔ expect-act-diff: same mechanism, two substrates

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S305 | Domain: brain/meta | Source: dream-cycle
Confidence: Theorized

## Finding
Dream cycle resonance: predictive coding (brain) ↔ P-182 (expect-act-diff) are the same.
- Brain: generate top-down prediction → compare sensory input → propagate error signal
- Swarm: declare expectation → act → classify diff (zero=confirm, large=lesson, persistent=challenge)
Both are mismatch-driven learners — zero-diff means efficient prediction, not stasis.

## Upgrade
P-182 is THEORIZED. Brain neuroscience makes it STRUCTURAL PARALLEL (ISO candidate):
predict → observe → error → update representation. Same loop, different substrate.
Upgrades confidence that expect-act-diff is a durable design, not a heuristic.

## ISO candidate
ISO-new: predictive coding error propagation ↔ expect-act-diff diff classification.

**ISO**: ISO-10 (predict-error-revise — predictive coding and P-182 expect-act-diff are the same mechanism in two substrates)
