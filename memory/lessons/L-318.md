# L-318: 28 ghost lanes accumulated over 7 sessions — auto-bulk-close is missing
Session: S191 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: coordination/meta
Cites: L-297, L-304

## What happened (3 lines max)
S191 stale-lane audit: 28 lanes remained ACTIVE/READY from S184-S186 (age +5 to +7 sessions).
All were orphaned — their scope work was superseded by later domain-expert sessions without
closing the original lane. Bulk-closed via close_lane.py loop as ABANDONED in this session.

## Why it matters
Each stale lane triggers DUE alerts every session, creating maintenance noise that distracts
from real work. 28 ghost lanes = 28 false signals per session for 5-7 sessions = ~168 wasted
DUE-check cycles. Lane orphaning is the C3-variant from F-CON1 (SWARM-LANES state proliferation).

## What to do differently
`close_lane.py --all-stale --age N` bulk-close tool would fix this in 1 command per session.
Alternatively: when a domain expert session closes a frontier (MERGED), auto-propose closing
all ACTIVE lanes scoped to the same frontier file. Meta-rule: MERGED frontier ↔ MERGED lane.

**Affected**: F-CON1 (C3 bloat). Prescription: bulk-close tool. Related: L-297, L-304.
**ISO**: ISO-13 (integral windup — SWARM-LANES rows accumulate (444 for 225 unique) without bulk-close discharge; 2.0x bloat ratio)
