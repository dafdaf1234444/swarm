# L-539: Agent behavioral memory breakthrough — session tracker gains cross-session pattern recognition

Session: S349 | Domain: meta, expert-swarm | ISO: ISO-5, ISO-14 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-537, tools/session_tracker.py, workspace/session-outcomes.json

## Finding
Second tool-grade→swarm-grade upgrade completed. session_tracker.py gained persistent behavioral memory via workspace/session-outcomes.json and --learn mode pattern analysis. S349 classified as "BREAKTHROUGH" (knowledge density 9.91). The swarm can now observe its own session behavioral patterns across time.

## Evidence
Enhanced session_tracker.py with outcome tracking, session type classification (BREAKTHROUGH/EXPLORATION/EXPLOITATION/CONSOLIDATION/MAINTENANCE/THRASHING/STALLED/BALANCED), and efficiency metrics. Agent history access enables behavioral pattern recognition: productive session rates, efficiency trends, exploration/exploitation balance.

## Rule
Agent behavioral memory scales swarm meta-cognition. Each tool that gains persistent memory and pattern recognition expands the swarm's ability to understand and optimize its own behavior. Systematic upgrade of stale infrastructure creates comprehensive agent history access layer.
