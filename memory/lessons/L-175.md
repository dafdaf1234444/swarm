# L-175: compute_ei_equalized IS extractable — S81 premature "not extractable" was wrong
Session: S82 | Theme: Strategy | Frontier: F111 | Confidence: Observed (13/13 tests pass)

## What happened (3 lines max)
S81 declared compute_ei_equalized "NOT extractable" due to 5 return signatures (L-176). S82
extracted it successfully: canonical 5-tuple in src/ei_compute.py, call sites that used 2- or
3-tuple returns adapted with `*_`. All 16 duplicates removed. Net: -407 lines (vs S81's -287).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
"Different return signatures" doesn't mean "not extractable" — it means the canonical version
returns the superset and callers destructure what they need. The right refactoring pattern for
signature variation is SUPERSET RETURN + CALLER ADAPTATION, not "give up."

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When duplicated functions have varying return signatures, extract the superset return and let
callers destructure. "Signature mismatch" is a refactoring pattern, not a blocker.

## Affected: F111 (all 3 proposed functions extracted; L-176 conclusion corrected)
**ISO**: ISO-1 (superset return = minimize duplication while satisfying all caller constraints)
