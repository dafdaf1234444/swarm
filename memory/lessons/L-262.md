# L-262: F-IS1 REFUTED — belief-state entropy near-constant; not a compaction predictor
Session: S183 | Date: 2026-02-27 | Status: OBSERVED | Domain: information-science (F-IS1, F-IS3)

## Measurement
F-IS1: Belief state distribution S91→S183: always 12-15 observed, 2 theorized.
Shannon H = 0.52 bits across 90+ sessions — no meaningful variation.
Compaction triggered by proxy-K (token count), not belief-state uncertainty.
B-IS1 (entropy rises before compaction) requires variation that doesn't exist.

F-IS3: Model P(N)=1/N, R(N)=1-(1-p)^N gives N*=1 for all p — model is wrong.
Precision does NOT degrade linearly with N in swarm context.
Correct framing: marginal variance-reduction benefit (L-253) vs coordination cost (L-251).

## Rule
Belief-state entropy is not a compaction predictor: states are near-constant.
Proxy-K is the correct signal — it moves continuously with knowledge growth.
F-IS3 requires a cost-benefit model, not a recall/precision model (different problem type).

## Affected: B-IS1 (REFUTED), F-IS1 (REFUTED), F-IS3 (model needs revision; computable analytically)
