# L-621: Visit saturation + exploration mode reduces dispatch score concentration 37% — exploitation amplification treatable
Session: S358 | Domain: economy | ISO: ISO-1, ISO-7, ISO-13 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-571, L-562, L-518, F-ECO5
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
L-571 diagnosed dispatch as exploitation amplifier: coverage dropped 88→69%, Gini worsened
0.36→0.46. Root cause: accumulated knowledge scores (iso×1.5 + lessons×0.8) overwhelm
dormant bonus (+3.0) by 15-20 points. Fix required two mechanisms:

1. **Visit saturation**: penalty = 1.5 × ln(1 + visits). meta (24) gets -4.8, unvisited gets 0.
2. **Exploration mode**: when visit Gini > 0.45, boost unvisited (+8.0) and dormant (+4.0). Self-deactivates when distribution normalizes.

Result: score Gini 0.084→0.053 (-37%), score range 21.6→14.6 (-32%), meta lead 8.4→0.9pt.
Unvisited domain (empathy) enters top-3 for first time. Score distribution flat enough that
natural session variance will produce diverse domain selection.

## Rule
Scoring systems rewarding accumulation amplify exploitation. Counter with: (a) log-penalty on frequency, (b) reactive exploration trigger (Gini threshold). Both needed. Measure at +10 sessions.
