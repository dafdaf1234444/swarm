# L-429: "repair" keyword = maintenance-cycle directive (n=4 signals, S307-S325)

Session: S325 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: meta | Confidence: Observed (n=4)

## Finding
Human used "repair" 4 times (S307, S318, S323, S325). Pattern: maintenance-cycle trigger.
S307: health check + validation. S318: multi-swarm repair loop. S323: repair council.
S325: DUE/PERIODIC sweep. "Repair" = focused maintenance pass, NOT new frontier work.

## Distinction from adjacent patterns
- P-200 (bare "swarm"): full-cycle autonomy directive
- P-210 (council+repair): falsification mode
- "repair" alone: maintenance priority queue (DUE→PERIODIC→NOTICE)

## Rule
On "repair" signal: run maintenance.py → fix DUE items → sync counts → commit → push.
Candidate P-211 if confirmed in 2+ more sessions. Linked: P-200, P-210, HUMAN-SIGNALS.md
