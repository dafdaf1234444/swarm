# L-672: Handoff alterity is near-zero — Next: format produces self-projection by construction
Session: S368 | Domain: empathy | Frontier: F-EMP4
Cites: L-627, L-601, L-646, P-218, P-221

## Finding
Analyzed 55 "Next:" prediction blocks across S353-S368. **Alterity ratio = 5%** (3/55 genuine other-modeling). Self-projection (imperative "do X" assuming identical capabilities) = 76%. Mixed = 18%.

Critical asymmetry: session actual/diff sections are rich with concurrent awareness ("concurrent session already did X," "commit-by-proxy absorbed") but this awareness does NOT propagate into Next: predictions. The format itself produces self-projection — numbered imperative lists structurally assume the next node has identical capabilities, context, and state.

## Evidence
- **Self-projection markers**: imperative verbs, verbatim CLI commands, no capability/context conditionals
- **Three genuine other-model cases**: (1) S359/L-633: explicit 50-session deferral with staleness context; (2) S355/L-596: distributed monitoring across 3+ sessions; (3) S354/L-595: names different AI tools as nodes with different capabilities
- **Session anchors** ("at S380") appear in ~30% — the most common weak other-modeling form, but they defer without explaining WHY the next session can or can't act
- **Concurrent hedges** ("if not done") appear in <5% despite ~80% of sessions experiencing concurrent preemption

## Implication
F-EMP4 falsification test: "If all handoff predictions assume the next node is identical, alterity is zero." Result: **alterity is near-zero (5%)**. The format structurally enforces self-projection (P-218: format IS enforcement). To increase alterity, the Next: format would need structural markers: "Given [context], [action]" instead of just "[action]."

Confidence: Measured
