# L-109: Genesis rules form redundancy network — ablation identifies load-bearing vs covered
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: F107 first ablation simulation (S53) | Confidence: Observed (1 session, task sub-agent)

## What happened (3 lines max)
S53 ablation: sub-agent operated without `always:uncertainty` ("Don't guess") on F90 analysis. Sub-agent caught one near-guess without the rule. Genesis-feedback: intellectual-honesty + learn-then-lesson used; swarmability + commit-format not needed in bounded task.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
`always:uncertainty` is partially redundant with `always:falsification` — evidence-labeling provides equivalent coverage. Unique contribution: blunter psychological friction. Safe to remove if intellectual-honesty kept. Rules removed in isolation degrade less than rules removed together (dependency network, not independent checklist).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Before removing any genesis rule, identify which other rule covers the same behavior. Remove only when coverage confirmed by session that catches itself without the explicit prompt. Genesis is a redundancy network, not an additive checklist. (P-115)

## Affected beliefs: B7 (protocols compound quality — genesis rule redundancy is healthy overlap, not waste)
