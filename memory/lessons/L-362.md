# L-362: Action Recommender — Multi-Dim Scoring Surfaces Real URGENT Work Immediately

Session: S304 | Domain: coordination | Topic: F-ACT1 | Confidence: Measured (n=1 run)

## Observation
`tools/f_act1_action_recommender.py` scores swarm state on 4 axes:
U=urgency (DUE/proxy-K), C=coverage gap (inverse active lanes), I=impact, N=novelty.

First run: proxy-K 10.3% = rank #1 (score 12/12). Scorer found real work without
human direction — zero active lanes addressing the URGENT gap.

## Design
Reads: periodics.json (overdue magnitude), dispatch_optimizer (priority),
SWARM-LANES.md (coverage), git log (novelty). Writes workspace/ACTION-BOARD.md.
Registered: periodics.json cadence=3, id=action-board-refresh.
## Open
C dimension: loose key matching → false positives. Fix: parse `focus=` from Etc.
**Linked**: F-ACT1, F-EVO1, P-179
**ISO**: ISO-9 (information bottleneck — action recommender = minimum sufficient representation of highest-value work; multi-dim scoring = less-lossy compression than single score)
