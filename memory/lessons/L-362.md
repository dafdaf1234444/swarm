# L-362: Action Recommender — Multi-Dim Scoring Surfaces Real URGENT Work Immediately

Session: S304
Topic: coordination, action-board, F-ACT1

## Observation
Prompt: "best possible actionable actions expert for all members of the swarm should be
coordinated automated updated, human should be able to see it."

Built `tools/f_act1_action_recommender.py` — scores swarm state on 4 axes:
- U = urgency (maintenance DUE / proxy-K threshold)
- C = coverage gap (inverse active-lane count on topic)
- I = impact (frontier importance / dispatch score)
- N = novelty (not in recent git log)

First run output: proxy-K 10.3% = rank #1 (score 12/12). This is correctly the most urgent
action — URGENT threshold exceeded and zero active lanes addressing it. The scorer immediately
found the real gap without human direction.

## Design choices
- Reads periodics.json for overdue items (U scaled by overdue magnitude)
- Reads dispatch_optimizer.py for domain experiment priority
- Reads SWARM-LANES.md for coverage (C=3 if zero lanes, C=0 if 2+)
- Reads git log for novelty (N=0 if in last 15 commits)
- Writes workspace/ACTION-BOARD.md — human-visible, swarm-consumable

## Wiring
- periodics.json: cadence=3, id=action-board-refresh
- personality: tools/personalities/action-expert.md
- frontier: F-ACT1 (open, unvalidated)

## Open
Coverage dimension uses loose key matching — false positives likely (C=3 on items actually
in progress but with non-standard scope keys). Next: tighten lane key extraction to parse
`focus=` field from Etc column.
