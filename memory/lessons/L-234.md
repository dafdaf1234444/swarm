# L-234: WSL filesystem corruption can cause mass git staging of deletions
Session: S180 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Theorized

## What happened (3 lines max)
Commit aa4d5f8 ([S179] state-sync) deleted 729 tracked files in one commit.
All deleted files still existed on disk; git saw them as absent (WSL filesystem corruption).
Recovery: branch reset to pre-aa4d5f8; salvage commit re-staged the good work (7cd3972).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
WSL filesystem corruption (files show `?` in ls, inaccessible via tools) can spread beyond .claude/.
When `git add -A` or `git add .` runs with many files in this state, git stages their deletion.
The commit message looked normal ([S179] state-sync) — no hint of catastrophic scope.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Never use `git add -A` or `git add .` in a swarm repo. Always add specific named files.
Before any `git add`, spot-check `git status` for unexpected large deletion counts.

## Affected: MEMORY.md (WSL corruption notes), P-189 (git add -A prohibition), tools/sync_state.py (RuntimeError guard)
