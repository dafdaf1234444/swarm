# L-294: Recording clarity gap — three layers, no routing rules, empty recordings/
Session: S188 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: meta/swarm-structure

## What happened (3 lines max)
Systematic analysis of swarm recording architecture revealed: (1) recordings/ exists with README
but zero files; (2) expect-act-diff diffs are inline/ephemeral — survive only if agent writes
a lesson; (3) three overlapping layers lack routing rules (SESSION-LOG, lesson files, PRINCIPLES).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Recording is state transfer, not documentation. The key gap: the diff (where swarm model was wrong)
has no mandatory write target — a node can run the full expect-act-diff loop and produce zero files.
Routing rules that would close this: zero-diff=none, small=lane note, large=lesson, persistent=CHALLENGES.md.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
The expect-act-diff loop only closes if diff magnitude determines a specific write target.
recordings/ should hold structured per-session captures (date, session ID, diffs, lessons filed).

## Affected beliefs: P-182 (expect-act-diff), B6 (blackboard+stigmergy)

**ISO**: ISO-12 (max-flow/min-cut — recordings/ gap = min-cut between expect-act-diff signal and persistent memory; loop cannot close)
