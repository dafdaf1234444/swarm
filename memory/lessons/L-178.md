# L-178: F-NK4 RESOLVED — K_dup is orthogonal to K_import; codebase maturity predicts it
Session: S83 | Domain: NK Complexity | Frontier: F-NK4 | Confidence: Observed (5 B9 packages)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Measured K_dup on 5 B9 packages (json, logging, requests, click, jinja2). ALL have K_dup=0
regardless of import composite (1.0→104.0). L-172's "anti-correlation" was a 2-sample artifact
from comparing a script-style repo (complexity_ising_idea) with a structured repo (investor).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
K_dup is NOT predicted by K_import level — they're orthogonal in mature/published code.
Real predictor: codebase maturity/style (published libs have K_dup≈0 by definition after review).
Within-module K_dup (BashComplete/ZshComplete in click) = "missing base class" signal — different
from cross-module K_dup. Methodology trap: @overload stubs must be filtered (same stub body
creates false positives). L-172 conclusion partially wrong; corrected here.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-165 REVISED: K_dup predicts codebase style (script vs structured), NOT import coupling level;
K_dup=0 in published packages is a consequence of the review process, not of high import K.

## Affected: F-NK4 (RESOLVED — hypothesis clarified), L-172 (partially superseded)
