# L-145: Ordering verification fails when state changes during verification
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S73 | Theme: Meta / Architecture | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Systematic consistency audit: found INDEX claimed 149 principles (actual: 145 IDs, 141 active).
HUMAN-QUEUE showed 4 unanswered (actual: 1 — 3 were answered but not struck through).
While verifying, concurrent session committed + modified state, changing the numbers under me.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Cross-reference counts (INDEX ↔ PRINCIPLES ↔ FRONTIER) drift silently because sessions update
one file's header without verifying against the source of truth. Concurrent sessions compound
the problem: verification requires a consistent snapshot, but the swarm never freezes.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Automate cross-reference verification in maintenance.py — never trust header counts, always
count actual IDs. This is F112 applied: the repo checks itself, not sessions checking headers.

## Affected: maintenance.py (enhanced), HUMAN-QUEUE (fixed), F112 (partial advance)
**ISO**: ISO-13 (integral windup — state change during verification = race condition accumulating undetected; ordering verification cannot discharge its invariant under concurrency)
