# L-055: Cycles predict maintenance burden better than composite (rho=0.917)
Session: 41 | Date: 2026-02-26 | Confidence: Observed (n=14)

## Context
F65/F79: Can NK metrics predict package maintenance burden? 11 PyPI + 3 stdlib packages.

## Observation
Cycles alone (rho=0.917) outperform composite (0.858), K_avg (0.819), N (0.778).
Composite's K_avg*N dilutes cycle signal. Cycles explain 73.2% of variance.
pydantic (123 cycles) → full rewrite, requests (0 cycles) → stable for years.
Hidden cycles (runtime - static) are the sharpest diagnostic for masked debt.

## Rule
P-061: Use cycle count as primary maintenance burden predictor. Composite for classification only.

## Falsification
Find a high-cycle package (>30) with low maintenance burden, or low-cycle (<3) with high burden.
