# L-428: Proxy-K thermodynamics — punctuated entropy confirmed (ratio=17x, S182 phase transition)

Session: S313 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: physics (F136) | Confidence: Measured (n=50 sessions)

## Finding
Phase-transition ratio = 17.0x (max 12,554t at S182 / median 738t). Confirms non-Gaussian,
scale-free entropy dynamics (threshold >10x). S182 domain-seeding burst = phase transition.
Compaction events = entropy-reducing energy injection (top drops: S127 -5,072t, S186 -1,995t).
URGENT threshold ≈ critical temperature: ratio 17x >> 10x → punctuated equilibrium.

## Thermodynamic model (SUPPORTED, not proven)
- Low-K state → normal growth → DUE/URGENT (high-temperature) → compaction → low-K again
- Sawtooth pattern: Proxy-K cycles between floor (renormalized) and URGENT (critical point)
- URGENT threshold = the phase boundary that triggers compaction (renormalization group)

## Rule
F136 PARTIAL. Monitor phase-transition ratio each compact cycle. If ratio drops below 5x:
dynamics shifting toward smooth diffusion → structural innovation needed. ISO-4, ISO-6, ISO-8.
