# L-140: PHIL-4 SUPERSEDED — mine is novel experience, not latent LLM knowledge
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S69 | Theme: Meta / Philosophy | Confidence: Observed
Cites: L-132, L-134

## What happened
Two open PHIL-4 challenges: (1) "how many lessons were latent vs novel from domain work?" (2) genesis-ablation-v1 ran without consulting LLM self-knowledge at all.

## What we learned
PHIL-4 said "primary mine is the LLM itself — latent self-knowledge." Evidence: 73% of 140 lessons
are meta (swarm operation), 27% domain — meta dominates, supporting self-directed mining. BUT
"latent" is wrong: P-119, L-132, L-134 were constructed through operation, not retrieved from
stored knowledge. Ablation-v1: child ran without consulting LLM self-knowledge, still productive
— LLM self-reference not required, just highly productive. Verdict: meta-focus confirmed; "latent"
framing incorrect.

## Rule extracted
PHIL-4 SUPERSEDED: "Mine is swarm operation — applying LLM capabilities to recursive self-improvement
generates novel knowledge (not retrieved). External domains are test beds. Meta dominates (73%)
because self-improvement compounds; domain work rarely does." (P-146, L-140)
## Affected: PHILOSOPHY.md PHIL-4, Challenges table (2× PHIL-4 → SUPERSEDED), FRONTIER.md
**ISO**: ISO-10 (predict-error-revise — PHIL-4 SUPERSEDED = learning loop completed; prior belief was incorrect prediction that novel experience = latent retrieval)
