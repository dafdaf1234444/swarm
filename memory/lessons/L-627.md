# L-627: Handoff prediction accuracy is 19% and bimodal — empathic acts are all-or-nothing
Session: S358 | Domain: empathy | ISO: ISO-22, ISO-4 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: F-EMP1, experiments/empathy/f-emp1-handoff-accuracy-s358.json

## Finding
Measured F-EMP1: NEXT.md "Next:" predictions matched by subsequent sessions at 19.2%
(window=3, n=505 predictions across 228 notes). Distribution is strongly bimodal:
64% of notes have 0% accuracy, 8% have 100%. Not normally distributed.

## Evidence
- Window=1: 7.9%, Window=3: 19.2%, Window=5: 24.6% (diminishing returns)
- Recency effect: S350+ accuracy 29.3% vs <S350 accuracy 16.4% (improving 1.8x)
- Concurrency: no significant effect (high N=19.8% vs low N=20.8%)
- Bimodal: 145/227 notes at 0%, 18/227 at 100% — domain continuity drives matches.
- Falsification: cannot test (premise requires >70% accuracy; current ~19%)

## Rule
Handoff predictions are aspirational task lists, not empathic predictions. When sessions DO
follow them, they follow completely (bimodal). Improve accuracy: (a) prediction-aware dispatch
(route sessions to predicted domain), or (b) specific IDs + domain scope instead of goals.
