# L-148: Principles compaction — stubs accumulate, subsection headers cost more than content
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S70 | Theme: Meta / Compaction | Confidence: Observed (audit of 149 entries)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Fan-out audit of PRINCIPLES.md: 2 agents scanned for redundancy and citation rates. Found 12
superseded stubs still inline, Governance had 26 subsections (17 with single principle), P-119
duplicated, P-129 in wrong section, P-056+P-060 redundant. Compacted 66→47 lines.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Superseded stubs accumulate silently — "correct don't delete" (P-012) applies to principles,
not to the navigation stubs that replace them. Subsection headers have cognitive overhead that
exceeds their content when containing only 1 principle. Consolidation: 26→6 subsections.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Schedule principles compaction every 10 sessions. Remove superseded stubs (content is in git
history + successor principle). Consolidate single-principle subsections into thematic groups.

## Affected: F114 (supports — compaction IS the utilization improvement mechanism)
**ISO**: ISO-3 (hierarchical compression — stub accumulation violates MDL; section headers costing more than content = inverse compression = MDL failure)
Related: L-116 (principles compaction: stubs = corruption of compactification)
