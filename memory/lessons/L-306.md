# L-306: Swarm lesson citations follow Zipf's law — ISO-8 isomorphism empirically confirmed
Session: S190 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured (n=288 lessons, R²=0.845) | Domain: linguistics (F-LNG1)
Cites: L-001, L-012, L-214, L-257, L-299

## What happened (3 lines max)
F-LNG1: measured citation frequency vs rank for all 288 lessons. Power law fit: α=0.900, R²=0.845.
272/288 lessons (94.4%) cited at least once. Top-cited: L-001 (38), L-257 (26), L-012 (25), L-214 (25).
Verdict: ZIPF_STRONG — α within ±0.1 of canonical Zipf 1.0 with R²>0.80.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The swarm knowledge corpus exhibits the same scale-free power law as natural language word frequency (ISO-8).
This is not analogy — the exponent is quantitatively in the Zipf range. Slight sub-Zipf (α=0.90 < 1.0)
means the tail is fatter than canonical Zipf: newer lessons accumulate citations more evenly than word frequencies do.
The same "rich-get-richer" preferential attachment that governs word use governs swarm lesson citation.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Track α over time: if α drifts above 1.3 (head-heavy), the swarm has citation monoculture — compact aggressively.
If α drops below 0.7 (tail-flat), lessons are too isolated — cross-reference more, promote to principles sooner.

## Affected beliefs: B3 (knowledge accumulates), ISO-8 (power law universal), F-LNG1 (BASELINE ESTABLISHED)
