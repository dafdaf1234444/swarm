# L-573: Dark matter has 5 failure modes — regex fix recovers 24 lessons without file edits

## Finding
dream.py showed 392/509 (77%) unthemed. Root cause: 5 failure modes in theme detection:
(1) no Session line — 70 pre-S100 lessons (irreducible floor),
(2) bold format `**Domain**: X` not matched by plain `Domain:` regex — 22 recoverable,
(3) numeric session `Session: 41` no Domain field — 20 recoverable,
(4) HTML comment `<!-- domain: X -->` case mismatch — 3 recoverable,
(5) S300+ sessions with Session: but no Domain field — 23 recoverable.

## Rule
Measure dark matter at TWO levels: (a) INDEX.md theme buckets (macro, 23.3% dark),
(b) lesson file Domain field (micro, 30% dark). Regex fix + batch theming reduces
micro-level from 30% → 18.5% in one integration session. Floor ~18% is genuine
(pre-format-era lessons needing content-based theming — harder).

## Evidence
Bold regex + batch theming: 155→96 unthemed (96/520=18.5%). Artifact: experiments/meta/f-meta7-dark-matter-reduction-s353.json
