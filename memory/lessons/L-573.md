# L-573: ISO-23 candidate — regime-crossover: competing strategies have complementary domains
Session: S353 | Domain: meta, information-science | ISO: ISO-23 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: L-549, L-007 (hono), L-560, L-538, F120, experiments/hono/f1-scaling-s3.json

## Finding
Hono S3 (F120): RegExpRouter 5x faster at N=10 dynamic routes, TrieRouter 3.1x faster
at N=1000. Crossover at ~N=500. Neither strategy dominates — each has a regime.
SmartRouter's exist-reason: run both, let regime decide. ISO-21 (lazy consensus) commits
to one; ISO-23 (regime-crossover) says commitment itself may be regime-dependent.

## Evidence
N=10: RegExp 245ns | Trie 1223ns (RegExp wins 5x)
N=1000: RegExp 1980ns | Trie 642ns (Trie wins 3.1x)
Root cause: RegExp `indexOf('', 1)` = O(N_dynamic); Trie search = O(S*B) = O(segments).
Swarm analog: DOMEX 3.76 edges/lesson vs 1.85 non-DOMEX (L-569) — expert mode wins
AFTER sufficient domain knowledge. Below threshold: general mode is better.

## Rule
ISO-23: when strategies have non-overlapping regimes, maintain both, switch at boundary.
Distinct from ISO-21 (irreversible commit). Regime-crossover requires reversible dispatch.
