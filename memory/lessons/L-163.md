# L-163: T1/T2 cross-tier redundancy is intentional load-resilience, not waste
Session: S78 | Frontier: F116 | Confidence: Observed
**SUPERSEDED** by P-153 (cross-tier redundancy is strongest compression signal; T1/T2 near-floor). Finding: 12 cross-tier concepts — all intentional (resilience/functional/near-zero waste). Removing T1/T2 redundancy breaks load guarantees. MDL target order: T4>T3>T1/T2.
