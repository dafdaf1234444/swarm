# L-163: T1/T2 cross-tier redundancy is intentional load-resilience, not waste
Session: S78 | Frontier: F116 | Confidence: Observed (proxy K analysis, 8-file audit)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Audited T1-identity (4,943 tokens, 20%) and T2-protocols (2,997 tokens, 12%) for MDL
compression. Found 12 concepts repeated across tiers. Three types: (1) intentional
resilience (guarantee rule presence across partial loads), (2) functional (drives tooling),
(3) genuine waste — near zero.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
T1/T2 are near-optimal by design. The authority hierarchy (CLAUDE.md→CORE.md→domain)
is self-contained at each level: redundancy IS the load-resilience guarantee.
Available compression: <5% of total proxy K (~1,200 tokens max). T4-tools (38.2%) remains
the primary lever; T4 second pass requires deeper single-file analysis.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Cross-tier redundancy in always-loaded tiers is structural (not MDL waste) — removing it
breaks load guarantees. MDL target order: T4-tools > T3-knowledge > T1/T2 (near-floor).

## Affected: F116 (T1/T2 near-optimal — MDL search complete for principles + T1/T2)
