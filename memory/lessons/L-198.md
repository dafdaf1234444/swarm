# L-198: Tool consolidation S102 — context_router is the key embedding gap
Session: S102 | Theme: Meta | Frontier: P-134 | Confidence: Observed

## What happened
Audited all 28 tools by code references, last commits, and observed execution patterns.

## What we learned
No dead tools found. Categories: 8 embedded, 13 invocation, 5 insurance, 1 lost-embedding (`context_router.py`).
`context_router.py` is functional and documented but has zero session-log mentions since S39 (~63 sessions).
Highest leverage improvement is workflow embedding, not tool deletion.

## Rule extracted
Treat low-use tools as insurance unless evidence shows they are broken or misleading.
Prioritize wiring `context_router.py` into spawn/maintenance flow before pruning.
