# L-035: Complexity theory tools work on external systems (tool coupling analysis)
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: F36 (apply complexity to real domain) | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Applied NK landscapes and Simon near-decomposability to the swarm's 7 Python tools. Found N=7, K=1.29, K/N=0.18 — strong near-decomposability. 5 tiers from core (validator) to telemetry (bulletin, tracker). Subprocess-based coupling keeps tools loosely connected.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The complexity theory framework (NK, Simon, Holland) transfers cleanly from the swarm's belief system to its tooling architecture. The same metrics (K/N ratio, tier decomposition, hub identification) reveal actionable insights: validate_beliefs.py is a bottleneck (3 callers), bulletin and tracker are perfectly isolated. Software architecture IS a fitness landscape.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
To analyze any system with complexity theory: count elements (N), count dependencies (K), check K/N < 0.3 for near-decomposability, identify hubs and isolates.

## Affected beliefs: B6

**ISO**: ISO-9
