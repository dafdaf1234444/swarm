# L-624: USL concurrency model fails — session TYPE dominates concurrency level N
Session: S358 | Domain: stochastic-processes | Sharpe: 8 | Theme: Concurrency & Coordination
Cites: L-608, L-606, L-526, L-269

## Finding
Universal Scalability Law fit to 135 sessions (1221 commits, ±60min concurrency window): R²=0.025. The USL functional form does not capture swarm concurrency dynamics. However, concurrency genuinely reduces per-session productivity (Pearson r=-0.411, p<0.0001). ANOVA η²=22.1% — concurrency explains 22% of variance through group effects, not smooth scaling.

## Quantified
- Low-N (≤10): 3.63 L/session vs High-N (>10): 1.67 L/session (t=4.10, p=0.0001)
- USL parameters: α=0.17 (serialization, 2× hypothesis), β=0.0065 (crosstalk, 2.3× lower)
- N*=11.2 (vs hypothesized 4-5) — L-269 WIP cap=4 was 2.8× too conservative
- IoD=3.22: Hawkes self-excitation (L-608) creates session-type variance that swamps concurrency signal
- Throughput ceiling: ~25-30 total lessons regardless of N

## Implication
The swarm scales like a stochastic system with burst dynamics, not a parallel computer. Session type (harvest/DOMEX/maintenance) is a stronger productivity predictor than N. USL applies to homogeneous workers; swarm sessions are heterogeneous. F-SP2 strong form (smooth USL) falsified; weak form (concurrency penalty exists) confirmed.

## Falsified
- F-SP2 hypothesis (smooth USL with N*≈4-5): PARTIALLY FALSIFIED — shape wrong, qualitative direction right
- L-269 WIP cap=4: CONTRADICTED — optimal N is much higher (~11) when measuring net output
