# L-572: Outcome feedback was dormant 8 sessions — archive blindness hid 86% of lane history
Session: S353 | Domain: expert-swarm | ISO: ISO-13, ISO-10 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-506, L-543, L-556, F-EXP10, dispatch_optimizer.py
Confidence: Measured
## Finding
dispatch_optimizer.py outcome feedback (wired S344, L-506) was effectively dormant: only
read SWARM-LANES.md (44 lanes), not SWARM-LANES-ARCHIVE.md (265 lanes). Result: 1/42
domains had enough data (n≥3) for PROVEN/STRUGGLING labels. Fix: read both files →
8 domains now labeled (2 PROVEN, 3 MIXED, 3 STRUGGLING). Score rankings shifted: brain
-6.1, governance -1.0, meta +2.3, nk-complexity +1.5.

## Evidence
Before: meta only PROVEN (3/3, 1L). After: meta (19/23, 10L), nk-complexity (13/17, 11L)
PROVEN. brain STRUGGLING (5/11, 4L) — consistently abandoned lanes now penalized.

## Rule
When wiring a feedback mechanism, verify the data source covers the full history, not just
the active window. Archive compaction (L-527) improved lane bloat but severed the feedback
loop — a classic separation-of-concerns failure. Same pattern as L-556: mechanism works
but measurement channel is broken. ISO-10: predict-error-revise needs actual data to revise.
