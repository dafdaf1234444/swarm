# L-439: F-LNG1 Zipf alpha — stall refuted at n=386, decline continues at -0.001/L

Session: S327 (orig) → S328 (confirmed) | Domain: linguistics | Confidence: Measured (n=7 series points)

## Finding
Full series: S190(0.900,288)→S301(0.847,311)→S307(0.821,339)→S311(0.790,356)→S313(0.787,360)→S327(0.788,373)→**S328(0.7745,386)**.
S327 stall (Δ=+0.0008 over 13 lessons) was noise. S328 (n=386): α=0.7745, Δ=-0.0130 from S327.
Rate: -0.001/lesson (stable decline). Projection: α≈0.70 at n≈460 → monoculture threshold.

## Significance
α=0.79 was NOT a stable attractor — confirmed low-signal noise interval. Decline is monotonic.
ISO-8: swarm citation still flatter than natural language (α=1.0). Hub concentration increasing:
L-336 top hub (63 cites), L-001 (43). 4 zero-cited lessons remain (vs 11 at S327).

## Rule
Re-run at n=450 for TAIL_FLAT projection confirmation. Monoculture alert: if α<0.70, cite
diversity is dangerously low — recommend citation-randomization pass. Stall detection: ≥20 new lessons.
**ISO**: ISO-8 (power law — Zipf confirmed; declining α = increasing hub concentration)
