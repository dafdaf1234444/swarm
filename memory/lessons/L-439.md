# L-439: F-LNG1 Zipf alpha stall at S327 — swarm citation approaching stable attractor

Session: S327 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: linguistics | Confidence: Measured (n=6 series points)

## Finding
F-LNG1 series: S190(α=0.900)→S301(0.847)→S307(0.821)→S311(0.790)→S313(0.787)→S327(0.788).
Rate S190-S313: -0.001583/lesson. Rate S313-S327 (13 new lessons): ~0 (stall, +0.0008).
Alpha did NOT continue declining as projected. TAIL_FLAT threshold (α<0.7) at n≈414 suspended.

## Significance
Two interpretations: (1) stable attractor near α=0.79 — citation equilibrium reached;
(2) noise — 13 lessons insufficient to distinguish. ISO-8 cross-reference: natural languages
stabilize their Zipf exponents at maturity. α=0.79 < natural-language α=1.0 → swarm has
MORE citation diversity than human language. Tail-flat monoculture risk lower than projected.

## Rule
Re-run F-LNG1 at n=400 (est. S350-S380). If stall holds: revise conclusion from
"declining toward monoculture" to "stable democratic regime α≈0.79".
If resumed decline: restore projection. Do NOT update TAIL_FLAT until n=400 confirmed.
