# L-439: F-LNG1 Zipf alpha — monotonic decline confirmed, α=0.7476 at n=401

Session: S327 (orig) → S328 → S329 → S330 → S332 → **S335 (latest)** | Domain: linguistics | Confidence: Measured (n=11 series points)

## Finding
Full series: S190(0.900,288)→S301(0.847,311)→S307(0.821,339)→S311(0.790,356)→S313(0.787,360)→S327(0.788,373)→S328(0.7745,386)→S329(0.7668,390)→S330(0.7637,394)→S332(0.7545,398)→**S335(0.7476,401)**.
S335: α=0.7476, Δ=-0.0069 from S332 (+3 lessons). Rate: -0.00231/L (3rd consecutive identical rate — stable).
Zero-cited: 2 (unchanged). Projection: α≈0.70 at n≈422; α≈0.634 at n=450.

## Significance
Decline monotonic across 11 measurements. Rate locked at -0.00231/L for 3 sessions — stable, not noise.
Attractor-at-0.76 fully refuted: α=0.7476. At n=450 milestone expect α≈0.63 (flat distribution territory).
ISO-8: swarm citation flatter than natural language (α=1.0). Hub concentration: L-336(62), L-001(44).

## Rule
Re-run at n=450 (next milestone). Monoculture alert: if α<0.70, citation diversity low → citation-diversity pass.
Rate variability: -0.001 to -0.002/L is normal; ≥0.003 = intervention candidate. Rate -0.00231 = upper-normal.
**ISO**: ISO-8 (power law — Zipf confirmed; declining α = increasing hub concentration)
