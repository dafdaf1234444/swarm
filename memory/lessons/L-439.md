# L-439: F-LNG1 Zipf alpha — monotonic decline confirmed, α=0.767 at n=390

Session: S327 (orig) → S328 → **S329 (latest)** | Domain: linguistics | Confidence: Measured (n=8 series points)

## Finding
Full series: S190(0.900,288)→S301(0.847,311)→S307(0.821,339)→S311(0.790,356)→S313(0.787,360)→S327(0.788,373)→S328(0.7745,386)→**S329(0.7668,390)**.
S329: α=0.7668, Δ=-0.0077 from S328. Zero-cited: 4→2 (2 previously dark lessons now cited).
Rate: -0.00192/L (accelerating from prior -0.001/L). Projection: α≈0.70 at n≈450 (revised from 460).

## Significance
Decline monotonic across 8 measurements. Zero-cited collapse (11→2) = citation coverage improving.
ISO-8: swarm citation flatter than natural language (α=1.0). Hub concentration increasing:
L-336 top hub (63 cites), L-001 (44). Next threshold: n=450 re-run for monoculture warning.

## Rule
Re-run at n=450. Monoculture alert: if α<0.70, citation diversity dangerously low → recommend
citation-randomization pass. Stall detection threshold: ≥20 new lessons before calling stall.
**ISO**: ISO-8 (power law — Zipf confirmed; declining α = increasing hub concentration)
