# L-439: F-LNG1 Zipf alpha — monotonic decline confirmed, α=0.7545 at n=398

Session: S327 (orig) → S328 → S329 → S330 → **S332 (latest)** | Domain: linguistics | Confidence: Measured (n=10 series points)

## Finding
Full series: S190(0.900,288)→S301(0.847,311)→S307(0.821,339)→S311(0.790,356)→S313(0.787,360)→S327(0.788,373)→S328(0.7745,386)→S329(0.7668,390)→S330(0.7637,394)→**S332(0.7545,398)**.
S332: α=0.7545, Δ=-0.0092 from S330 (+4 lessons). Rate: -0.00231/L (re-accelerated from S330's -0.00077/L).
Zero-cited: 2 (down from 3 at S330). Attractor-at-0.76 hypothesis CHALLENGED — α is now below it.

## Significance
Decline monotonic across 10 measurements. Rate highly variable (-0.001 to -0.002/L typical; S332 hit -0.00231).
Attractor-at-0.76 refuted: α=0.7545 < 0.76. If rate sustains, α≈0.70 at n≈421 (intervention zone sooner than projected).
ISO-8: swarm citation flatter than natural language (α=1.0). Hub concentration: L-336(63), L-001(44).

## Rule
Re-run at n=450 (next milestone). Monoculture alert: if α<0.70, citation diversity low → citation-diversity pass.
Rate variability: -0.001 to -0.002/L is normal; ≥0.003 = intervention candidate.
**ISO**: ISO-8 (power law — Zipf confirmed; declining α = increasing hub concentration)
