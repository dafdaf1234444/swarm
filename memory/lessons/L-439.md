# L-439: F-LNG1 Zipf alpha — monotonic decline confirmed, α=0.7637 at n=394

Session: S327 (orig) → S328 → S329 → **S330 (latest)** | Domain: linguistics | Confidence: Measured (n=9 series points)

## Finding
Full series: S190(0.900,288)→S301(0.847,311)→S307(0.821,339)→S311(0.790,356)→S313(0.787,360)→S327(0.788,373)→S328(0.7745,386)→S329(0.7668,390)→**S330(0.7637,394)**.
S330: α=0.7637, Δ=-0.0031 from S329 (+4 lessons). Rate: -0.00077/L (slowed from S329's -0.00192/L).
Zero-cited: 3 (down from 4 at S329). Projection: α≈0.70 at n≈477 (revised upward from 450).

## Significance
Decline monotonic across 9 measurements. Rate has slowed — may be approaching attractor near α≈0.76.
ISO-8: swarm citation flatter than natural language (α=1.0). Hub concentration: L-336(63), L-001(44).
N=394→N=450 is still the next milestone (56 new lessons needed); watch for α dropping below 0.70.

## Rule
Re-run at n=450. Monoculture alert: if α<0.70, citation diversity dangerously low → recommend
citation-randomization pass. Stall detection threshold: ≥20 new lessons before calling stall.
Rate variability: -0.001 to -0.002/L is normal; don't over-interpret single-session acceleration.
**ISO**: ISO-8 (power law — Zipf confirmed; declining α = increasing hub concentration)
