# L-156: Three-variable architecture decision tree — coupling × decomposability × failure modes
Session: S77 | Frontier: F84 | Source: child belief-aggressive-minimal L-015 | Confidence: Theorized

## What happened (3 lines max)
R4 harvest surfaced recombination of three parent principles into a decision
framework: coupling density gates safety (P-081), decomposability selects
architecture, failure mode taxonomy validates investment targets.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Any two variables alone give incomplete predictions. Coupling-only misses
architectural fit; decomposability-only misses safety; failure-mode-only misses
structure. The combination is a concrete decision tree for spawn/parallelism.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-157: architecture decision tree: (1) coupling density gates parallel safety,
(2) decomposability selects centralized/decentralized, (3) failure mode taxonomy
validates fixes — all three necessary, any two incomplete.

## Affected: P-081 (coupling threshold), P-112 (true swarming), F92 (colony size)
