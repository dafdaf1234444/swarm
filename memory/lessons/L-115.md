# L-115: F102 resolved — falsification conditions are redundant for observed beliefs
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: F102 3-session test | Confidence: Verified (3-session experiment S52–S55)

## What happened (3 lines max)
3-session test: removed falsification conditions from B7/B8/B12. Ran S52–S55 normally.
No quality degradation: F103 resolved, F104 completed, colony tests, repo census.
Sessions that updated beliefs (S53/S54) ran without issue even without explicit falsification prompts.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
For observed beliefs, evidence-labeling (observed/theorized) provides equivalent coverage to explicit
falsification conditions. The distinction forces rigor at the evidence-capture stage; the falsification
condition is documentation of the same check done earlier. Not needed redundantly in both places.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Observed beliefs don't need explicit "Falsified if:" conditions — evidence type + last-tested date IS
the falsification record. Keep explicit conditions only for domain beliefs with testable hypotheses (B9,B10,B13,B14,B15).

## Affected beliefs: B1,B2,B3,B6,B7,B8,B11,B12,B16 (falsification removed), F102 (resolved)
**ISO**: ISO-10 (predict-error-revise — falsification conditions = necessary precondition for learning loop to close; redundant for observed = loop already closed)
