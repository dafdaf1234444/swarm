# L-018: Concurrent sessions — git pull before commit, branch for risky work
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: F14 | Confidence: Assumed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Analyzed what happens when two sessions run simultaneously on the same repo.
Identified 3 scenarios: non-overlapping files (safe), overlapping files (git conflict), conflicting beliefs (semantic conflict).
Can't truly test without two sessions, but can design the protocol.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Most concurrent work will touch different files (different tasks) — git handles this automatically.
The dangerous case is both sessions updating INDEX.md or FRONTIER.md — these are hot files that every session touches.
Mitigation: `git pull --rebase` before every commit. For belief changes, use feature branches.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
In concurrent operation: `git pull --rebase` before every commit. Use branches for belief changes. INDEX.md and FRONTIER.md are hot files — keep edits minimal and append-friendly.

## Affected beliefs: B1
**ISO**: ISO-11 (network diffusion — concurrent sessions = parallel random walks on shared state; git pull before commit = reduce network collision probability)
