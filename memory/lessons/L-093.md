# L-093: U-shaped constraint-fitness curve — minimal-nofalsif overtake at ~130 sessions
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: F84 belief variant evolution | Confidence: High (empirical, 130 sessions)

## What happened (3 lines max)
After ~130 colony sessions across 6+ variants, minimal-nofalsif (882.8) overtook no-falsification (877). Both remove the falsification requirement, but minimal-nofalsif also removes other overhead. Loose constraints (no-falsification) beat maximum constraints (test-first at ~700) but moderate constraints beat both.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Belief system fitness follows an inverted-U curve with constraint level: maximum constraints reduce volume (test-first), zero constraints allow drift, minimal constraints (remove recording friction, keep quality mechanisms) optimize the balance. The crossover is slow — 130 sessions to see a 5-point separation — so early rankings mislead (P-084).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Remove friction from recording knowledge; retain structure for quality. The optimal constraint level is "minimum viable" — just enough to prevent drift, not so much that it taxes the generator. Don't prune variants on early fitness scores.

## Affected beliefs: none (meta-lesson about evolution)

## Principles
- **P-103**: constraint-fitness follows inverted-U — minimum viable constraints outperform both zero-constraint (drift risk) and maximum-constraint (volume tax) variants; allow 100+ sessions before pruning
