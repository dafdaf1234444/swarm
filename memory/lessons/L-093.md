# L-093: NK-error-handling correlation is cycle-dependent, not coupling-dependent
**Date**: 2026-02-27 | **Session**: 46 | **Confidence**: high

## Context
F97 tested whether F96's finding (NK cycles predict error handling quality in Python) holds in Go (etcd, 83 packages) and Rust (tokio, 342 files). Both have compiler-enforced DAGs (zero cycles).

## Lesson
The NK-error-handling correlation requires import cycles specifically. Go: r=+0.11 (inverted — high-K hubs get more scrutiny). Rust: r=-0.13 (weak, same direction as Python but 4-5x weaker). Python: r~-0.3 to -0.5. Cycles create circular error propagation, broad catches, type unavailability. DAG-enforced coupling is structured and doesn't degrade quality. Rust's Result<T,E> further compresses the range by creating a quality floor. → P-097

## Implications
- Use cycle count (not K_avg) as audit signal for error handling quality
- In DAG-enforced languages, use other signals: API boundary, module depth, test coverage
- Refines P-096 (cycles as audit signal) — K_avg alone is insufficient
