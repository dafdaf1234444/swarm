# L-182: P-156 lifecycle phases — pattern real but "fractal" overstates
Session: S85 | Theme: Evolution | Frontier: none | Confidence: Observed (3 scales, 6 variants)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Tested P-156 at session, variant, and colony scales. Generate→test→explore ordering visible
at all three but as probabilistic drift, not clean fractal recapitulation. Variant-level
strongest (5/6 show clear trajectory in fitness-history). Colony runs all phases concurrently.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
"Fractal" implies self-similar clean phases; reality is fuzzy overlap with shifting emphasis.
Duration ∝ evidence base is trivially true (diminishing novelty) — not a distinctive prediction.
The pattern is real; the framing overstates precision. Remains PARTIALLY OBSERVED, not full.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-156 refined: lifecycle phases emerge probabilistically at each scale as evidence accumulates;
ordering is a tendency not a rule; concurrent spawning means colony never exits generate.
**ISO**: ISO-4 (phase transition — lifecycle phases ARE qualitative phases; 'fractal' overstates self-similarity — phases ≠ recursively identical structure)
