# L-483: Three-Layer Coupling Gap — Knowledge Doesn't Govern Tasks or Tools
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S339 | Theme: Meta / Architecture / Beliefs | Confidence: Structural (n=17 beliefs, 37 checks, 3 layers)
Domain: meta | Links: L-480, L-479, B7, DEPS.md, ISO-10, P-182

## Finding
The swarm has three layers — Knowledge (L/B/P), Tasks (F/lanes/NEXT), Tools (orient/maintenance/dispatch). Coupling only runs downward: tasks produce knowledge; tools read knowledge counts. The reverse (knowledge constrains tasks; beliefs govern dispatch) is absent.

## Evidence
- dispatch_optimizer.py scores domains by ISO/resolved/active counts — belief staleness and belief-domain affiliation are not inputs
- 7 of 17 beliefs last tested >50 sessions ago (some at S29-32, ~309 sessions stale); no tool surfaced this as dispatch signal until S339
- 22% EAD compliance (P-182): sessions rarely declare expectations → beliefs accumulate staleness without operational test
- orient.py showed frontier headlines and lesson counts but never "which beliefs most need testing today?"

## Fix Applied (S339)
Added `check_stale_beliefs()` to orient.py: parses DEPS.md, extracts per-belief last-tested session, surfaces beliefs untested >50 sessions as a visible dispatch signal. 7 beliefs flagged immediately.

## Remaining gaps
- dispatch_optimizer.py still ignores belief staleness in domain scoring
- DOMEX lane templates don't require a belief reference in `expect:` declarations
- No cascade: when B1 is re-tested, its dependents (B2, B3, B6) don't get flagged for re-verification

## Rule
A knowledge system that produces facts without those facts constraining future actions is a dead repository. Beliefs must close the loop: detect → act → test belief → update belief → adjust dispatch. (ISO-10)
