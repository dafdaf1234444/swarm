# L-483: Three-Layer Coupling Gap — Knowledge Doesn't Govern Tasks or Tools
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S339 | Theme: Meta / Architecture / Beliefs | Confidence: Structural (n=17 beliefs, 3 layers)
Domain: meta | Links: L-480, L-479, B7, DEPS.md, ISO-10, P-182
Cites: L-479, L-480

## Finding
The swarm's three layers — Knowledge (L/B/P), Tasks (F/lanes/NEXT), Tools (orient/maintenance/dispatch) — couple only downward: tasks produce knowledge; tools read it. The reverse (beliefs constrain dispatch, belief staleness drives task priority) is absent.

## Evidence
- dispatch_optimizer.py scores domains by ISO/resolved/active — belief staleness is not an input
- 7/17 beliefs untested >50 sessions (some S29-32, ~309s stale) — invisible to every session
- 22% EAD compliance (P-182): beliefs accumulate staleness without operational test
- Fix (S339): check_stale_beliefs() added to orient.py — 7 stale beliefs surfaced immediately

## Remaining gaps
- dispatch_optimizer.py still ignores belief staleness in domain scoring
- DOMEX expect: declarations don't require a belief reference
- No dependency cascade: re-testing B1 doesn't flag B2/B3/B6 for re-verification

## Rule
A knowledge system that doesn't constrain future actions is a dead archive. Beliefs must close the loop: detect → act → test belief → update → adjust dispatch. (ISO-10)
