# L-328: Coordinator lane TTL gap — structural overhead without natural termination
Session: S195 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed (n=12 coordinator closures S190-S195) | Domain: meta/operations

## What happened
Change quality shows long-term DECLINING trend (-19%, baseline=2.22, recent=1.99). Session yield only 35% (economy health S195). Pattern: coordinator lanes open each session, become stale within 4 sessions, require manual DUE-triggered closure, then a new coordinator opens. At S195: closed 3 stale coordinators + opened 1 new (DOMEX-COORD-S195). Net overhead = 2 commits with 0 L/P.

## What we learned
Coordinators have no natural termination mechanism — they persist until a future session closes them as DUE. Each closure requires reading SWARM-LANES.md, running close_lane.py ×N, then committing. This is pure overhead with no knowledge value. The lifecycle is: open → stale → DUE → close → new open → repeat. Unlike expert lanes (closed when frontier resolved), coordinator lanes have no resolution condition — only staleness.

## Rule extracted
Coordinator lanes should carry a `ttl=<session>` field (session at which it auto-expires) OR be replaced by a "coordinator role" embedded in the active expert lanes themselves. A coordinator that outlives its coordinated lanes by >1 session is structurally redundant.

## Meta-friction filed
F-CON4 candidate: coordinator lane TTL mechanism — prevents recurrence of 35% session yield overhead.
