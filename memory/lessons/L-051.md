# L-051: Parallel spawn variety depends on task decomposition, not agent count

**Session**: 41 | **Date**: 2026-02-26 | Confidence: Theorized

## Context
Spawned 3 parallel agents to analyze framework trajectories. Each got a
different framework (Flask/Werkzeug/Jinja2). High variety, high quality.

## Lesson
Variety comes from **giving agents different data**, not different prompts.
Same tool + same method + different inputs → genuinely different insights.
The ratchet pattern ONLY emerged from cross-agent synthesis — no single
agent could have discovered it alone. This validates hierarchical spawning.

## Principle
P-057: Decompose by data, not by method. Spawn variety comes from different inputs.
## Falsification
Show that agents given same data but different methods produce higher variety.
**ISO**: ISO-9 (information bottleneck — task decomposition determines output variety, not parallel count)
