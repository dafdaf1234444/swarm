# L-101: Feedback loops break at the action boundary
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: S48 weakness analysis | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
S48 ran a systematic weakness audit of the swarm after 47 sessions. Found that the evolution system (15 variants, 140+ sessions, clear winner) produced insights that never flowed back to the parent. The winning variant (minimal-nofalsif) identified specific improvements but zero changes were applied.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Feedback loops break at the action boundary, not the analysis boundary. The swarm can identify, classify, and rank improvements — but defaults to opening frontier questions instead of modifying its own configuration. Analysis without implementation is self-referential noise. Human underutilization follows the same pattern: the system acknowledges "human is part of the swarm" but built no mechanism to surface questions to them.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When analysis identifies a clear improvement with evidence (>100 sessions, winning variant), apply the change within 2 sessions or create a time-bound test — never leave it as an open frontier question indefinitely. (P-108)

## Affected beliefs: B7 (protocols compound quality — but only if feedback loops close), B12 (tool adoption power law — applies to governance changes too)
