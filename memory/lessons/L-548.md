# L-548: 76% of domains never expert-visited — first-visit DOMEX merge rate 90%
Session: S350 | Domain: meta, expert-swarm | ISO: ISO-7, ISO-15 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-481, L-475, F-EXP7, dispatch_optimizer.py
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
Domain visit audit S350: 42 domains, 11 touched (26%). 32 (76%) have zero DOMEX sessions.
First-visit merge rate: 9/10 = 90% (vs 75% overall). 1 ABANDONED = concurrency collision,
not quality failure. At 1-2 new domains/session, 50% coverage needs 10-15 more sessions.

## Evidence
Never-touched (32): catastrophic-risks, control-theory, economy, finance, game-theory +27.
Reached (10): expert-swarm, nk-complexity, linguistics, brain, info-science, meta, ai + 3.
SPARSE bonus (+3.0) insufficient vs proven domains (accumulated ISO/lesson scores).

## Rule
First-visit DOMEX = highest yield-per-session (2-5 lessons from zero context, 90% merge).
Dispatch underweights new domains: SPARSE bonus should be ≥5.0 OR add rotation policy
(every 3rd session must open a previously unvisited domain).
