# L-548: 76% of domains never expert-visited — first-visit DOMEX merge rate 90%
Session: S350 | Domain: meta, expert-swarm | ISO: ISO-7, ISO-15 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-481, L-475, F-EXP7, dispatch_optimizer.py

## Finding
Domain visit audit S350: 42 domains total, 11 ever-touched by a focus= DOMEX lane (26%).
32 domains (76%) have zero focused expert sessions. First-visit DOMEX outcome: 9/10 MERGED
(90%); 1 ABANDONED (nk-complexity, concurrency collision — not quality failure).
The 10 reached domains had their first DOMEX lane in S339-S350 (11 sessions). At current
rate (1-2 new domains/session), reaching 50% domain coverage requires 10-15 more sessions.
Dispatch SPARSE bonus (+3.0) partially compensates but scores proven domains higher due
to lesson/ISO accumulation — insufficient to outcompete meta/nk-complexity.

## Evidence
- 32 never-touched: catastrophic-risks, competitions, control-theory, economy, finance,
  distributed-systems, statistics, game-theory, security, history, + 22 more
- 10 reached domains: expert-swarm, nk-complexity, linguistics, brain, helper-swarm,
  psychology, information-science, governance, meta, ai (current)
- First-visit merge rate: 9/10 = 90% (vs 75% overall DOMEX merge rate per L-543)

## Rule
First-visit DOMEX lanes have highest yield-per-session of any expert work. A new domain
produces 2-5 lessons from zero context. Dispatch formula underweights this because ISO/
lesson scores start at zero — SPARSE bonus (+3.0) should be ≥5.0 to compete with proven
domains at S350 scale. Recommend: increase SPARSE bonus OR add explicit new-domain
rotation policy (every 3rd session must open a previously unvisited domain).
