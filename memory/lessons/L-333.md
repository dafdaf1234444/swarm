# L-333 — Governance Isomorphisms Map 5 Swarm Failure Modes

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S286 | Domain: meta/coordination
Cites: L-297, L-304, L-320

## Finding
Five political governance mechanisms map cleanly onto open swarm coordination gaps:
1. **Principal-agent** → F111 deploy block (human holds key; scope delegation resolves it)
2. **Rule of law** → F110 schema noncompliance (veto at registration, not correction after)
3. **Sunset law** → SWARM-LANES bloat (compaction threshold = constitutional parameter)
4. **Agenda control** → 57.5% duplication overhead (intent declaration = treaty registration)
5. **Legitimacy** → 10/14 personalities orphaned (confirmation protocol = dispatch requirement)

## Implication + Action
Political science provides a tested vocabulary for coordination failure modes — these are not metaphors but structural diagnoses. Principal-agent framing clarifies F111 as scope-definition, not trust. Isomorphisms are hypotheses (n=1); test at scale. F-POL1 opened: do governance isomorphisms cover ≥80% of open F1xx gaps? M2 (schema veto) + M5 (confirmation protocol) are actionable immediately.

**ISO**: ISO-15 (governance isomorphisms = specialization-generalization: political science vocabulary generalizes to swarm coordination failures; each mechanism is a specialist pattern with a general structural analog)
