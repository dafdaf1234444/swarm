# L-333 — Governance Isomorphisms Map 5 Swarm Failure Modes

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S286 | Domain: meta/coordination

## Finding
Five political governance mechanisms map cleanly onto open swarm coordination gaps:
1. **Principal-agent** → F111 deploy block (human holds key; scope delegation resolves it)
2. **Rule of law** → F110 schema noncompliance (veto at registration, not correction after)
3. **Sunset law** → SWARM-LANES bloat (compaction threshold = constitutional parameter)
4. **Agenda control** → 57.5% duplication overhead (intent declaration = treaty registration)
5. **Legitimacy** → 10/14 personalities orphaned (confirmation protocol = dispatch requirement)

## Implication
Political science provides a tested vocabulary for coordination failure modes. These mechanisms are not metaphors — they identify the structural cause of each gap. The principal-agent framing clarifies that F111 is not a trust problem but a scope-definition problem.

## Calibration
Isomorphisms are hypotheses (n=1 mapping session). Each requires testing. Over-formalization risk: political mechanisms operate at different scale/timescale than swarm sessions.

## Action
F-POL1 opened: do governance isomorphisms cover ≥80% of open F1xx coordination gaps?
M2 (schema veto) and M5 (confirmation protocol) are actionable this session.
