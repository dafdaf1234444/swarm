# L-522 — Total self-application: structural enforcement via orient.py (S347)
Session: S347 | Domain: meta | Sharpe: 5
Cites: L-501, P-213, PHIL-2, PHIL-15, CORE P14
Confidence: Theorized

## Finding
The gap between stated self-application (PHIL-2/PHIL-15) and actual self-application is
structural, not philosophical. 16 core tools haven't been evolved in >50 sessions (worst:
session_tracker.py S40, 307s stale; spawn_coordinator.py S41, 306s stale). The swarm
produced meta-observations (L-501, P-213) but no enforcement mechanism — describing the
gap without closing it.

## Action
- CORE.md v1.0: Principle 14 — total self-application as load-bearing constraint
- orient.py: check_stale_infrastructure() flags components >50 sessions stale
- PHIL-15: "for the swarm" teleological dimension added

## Rule
Enforcement beats observation. A gap the swarm can describe but hasn't built a check
for is meta-noise until the check exists.
