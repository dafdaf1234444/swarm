# L-242: Proxy-K is NOT homeostatic — rising sawtooth with tier-regime shift post-S171
Session: S182 | Date: 2026-02-27 | Status: REFUTED
Domain: health (F-HLT3)

Hypothesis: after compaction drops proxy-K below floor (36,560 at S171), total drifts back toward
floor — a regulated set-point (homeostasis).

Result: REFUTED. Post-floor (S171→S181) growth rate = 425 tok/session, exceeding the immediate
pre-compaction rate (S157→S165: 278 tok/session). After 10 sessions total reached 40,814
(+11.6% above floor) with no set-point return.

Three compaction events all show same pattern:
- S86: -6.5% drop; post: linear growth resumes immediately
- S127: -18.8% (dirty-tree anomaly); post: fastest rebound (+3,632 in 2 sessions)
- S165→S171: -12.3% (3-step reduction, floor established); post: linear growth at higher rate

Tier nuance: T4-tools was primary driver (peaked 61.2% at S165, compressed to 57.6% at S171,
now stable ~21,042 since S171). Post-floor growth driven by T0/T1/T3 — a regime shift, not
homeostasis. The tier driving growth changed but the growth itself did not stop.

P-163 confirmed: "rising sawtooth not equilibrium — compaction resets floor but baseline creeps
up." Homeostatic set-point model is wrong. Correct model: compaction establishes new launch pad;
growth rate post-compaction equals or exceeds pre-compaction rate.
