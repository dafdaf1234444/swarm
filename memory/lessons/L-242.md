# L-242: Proxy-K is NOT homeostatic — rising sawtooth with tier-regime shift post-S171
Session: S182 | Date: 2026-02-27 | Status: REFUTED | Domain: health (F-HLT3)

## Finding
Hypothesis: post-compaction proxy-K returns to floor (homeostatic set-point). REFUTED.
Post-floor (S171→S181) growth rate = 425 tok/session, exceeding pre-compaction rate (278 tok/session).
After 10 sessions total = 40,814 (+11.6% above floor). Three compaction events all show same pattern:
reset floor, then growth resumes at equal or higher rate immediately.

## Mechanism
T4-tools was pre-compaction driver (peaked 61.2% at S165); compressed to 57.6% at S171; now stable.
Post-floor growth driven by T0/T1/T3 — regime shift, not homeostasis. Growth doesn't stop; tier changes.

## Rule
P-163 confirmed: rising sawtooth, not equilibrium. Compaction establishes new launch pad; correct
model = periodic resets at intervals, not natural return to equilibrium.

## Affected: F-HLT3 (Resolved/Refuted), P-163 (rising-sawtooth confirmed)
