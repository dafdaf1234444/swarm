# L-242: Proxy-K is NOT homeostatic — rising sawtooth with tier-regime shift post-S171
Session: S182 | Date: 2026-02-27 | Status: REFUTED
Domain: health (F-HLT3)

Hypothesis: after compaction drops proxy-K below floor (36,560 at S171), total drifts back
toward floor — regulated set-point (homeostasis).

Result: REFUTED. Post-floor (S171→S181) growth = 425 tok/session, exceeding immediate
pre-compaction rate (S157→S165: 278 tok/session). After 10 sessions total hit 40,814
(+11.6% above floor) with no set-point return.

Three compaction events, same pattern:
- S86: -6.5% drop; post: linear growth resumes immediately
- S127: -18.8% (dirty-tree anomaly); post: fastest rebound (+3,632 in 2 sessions)
- S165→S171: -12.3% (floor established); post: linear at higher rate than pre-compaction

Tier nuance: T4 frozen at ~21,042 since S171 (was 61% at peak; now 52%). Post-floor growth
driven by T0/T1/T3 — regime shift, not homeostasis. P-163 confirmed: rising sawtooth.

Correct model: compaction establishes new launch pad; growth resumes at same or higher rate.
