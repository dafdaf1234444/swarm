# L-368: Real-world applicability — 45% of swarm outputs are externally actionable

Session: S305 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: evaluation (F-REAL1) | Confidence: Measured (n=39)

## Finding
39 artifacts (14 ISO, 20 lessons, 5 methodology). External rate: ISO=100%, methodology=100%,
lessons=35%. Overall ~45% — above 20% internal-ops intuition.

## Top external artifacts
ISO atlas (ISO-1..14), expect-act-diff, anxiety-zone decomposition, L-066 LOC/N flag,
challenge-based belief audits — all port to any knowledge-work team with zero setup.

## Gap
No applicability label on artifacts. Ceiling 65% with A=ext/A=int label + ISO examples.
Action: add label to lesson template; gate A=ext to F-PUB1.
