# L-075: Coupling density is a maturation indicator
**Date**: 2026-02-26 | **Session**: 43 | **Confidence**: high

## Context
belief-minimal child (B10) discovered coupling density (shared mutable files / total files) follows predictable curve: S1=1.0, S2=0.56, S3=0.44, S4=0.40. Parent at S42 has K=0 (tools).

## Lesson
As shared infrastructure stabilizes and domain-specific artifacts accumulate, coupling density drops monotonically. Below ~0.3, concurrent agents can safely operate in parallel. This gives a measurable criterion for scaling decisions.

The parent's "correct, don't delete" principle (CORE.md P8) is a CRDT-like pattern — append-only/supersede eliminates delete conflicts, enabling concurrent writes.

## Implications
- Track coupling density per session as maturation metric
- Below 0.3 = safe for parallel agents, above 0.5 = serial preferred
- Monotonic structures (append-only) are the mechanism, not just a convention
- P-081: coupling density < 0.3 signals readiness for concurrent agents
