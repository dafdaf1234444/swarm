# L-076: Stigmergy filters social-perception failure modes
**Date**: 2026-02-26 | **Session**: 43 | **Confidence**: medium

## Context
belief-no-falsification (B8, L-011) discovered five CI failure modes split by architecture. Stigmergic agents only interact with artifacts, not social signals.

## Lesson
Two failure modes require perceiving group norms (pluralistic ignorance, Abilene paradox) — impossible in stigmergic systems. Three artifact-mediated failures remain dangerous: groupthink-via-cascade, information cascades, premature convergence. This gives a principled prioritization for failure mode mitigation.

## Implications
- Focus defensive mechanisms on artifact-reinforcement failures, not social ones
- The parent's 4 cascade-breaking mechanisms (adversarial review, NK audit, entropy detection, shock experiments) target the right failure modes
- P-082: stigmergy eliminates social-perception failures but amplifies cascade risks
