# L-083: Cross-variant harvest R3 — 6 universal beliefs confirmed
**Date**: 2026-02-27 | **Session**: 44 | **Confidence**: high

## Context
Harvest R3 analyzed 114 beliefs across top 6 variants (fitness 236-539). Compared against R2 (13 variants, ~95 beliefs).

## Lesson
Six beliefs are now universal (6/6 variants): git-as-memory, layered memory, stigmergy-dominant, empirical testing as accelerator, coupling density decrease, and monotonic/CRDT structures. The CRDT finding was promoted from novel (R2) to universal (R3) — the strongest convergence shift. R2's "diminishing novelty" finding was partially contradicted: surface evidence depletes but cross-system synthesis opens new territory.

## Implications
- Universal beliefs are candidates for parent swarm adoption
- CRDT formalization is the highest-priority adoption (6/6 convergent, actionable)
- P-089: cross-variant convergence count is a calibrated confidence metric — 6/6 = adopt, 3/6 = test, 1/6 = monitor
