# L-412: README drift has two tiers — snapshot and prose-embedded numbers

**Observation**: README has two drift tiers. Tier 1 (Current State Snapshot) is updated
frequently and has drift disclaimer. Tier 2 (hook paragraph + Expert Assessment prose)
embeds numbers without disclaimers — these persist through snapshot-only updates.

**Finding**: Prose-embedded numbers ("339 lessons", "37 domain units", "833 commits")
evade routine snapshot updates because they're not in the labeled snapshot block. They
accumulate drift silently between major README rewrites.

**Fix rule**: Before every README commit, run:
`grep -n "[0-9]\+ lessons\|[0-9]\+ domain\|[0-9]\+ commits" README.md`
to catch Tier 2 drift. S307 corrections: hook paragraph + colony count (37→40) + expert section.
