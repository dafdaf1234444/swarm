# L-282: Entropy, emergence, and power laws complete the isomorphism atlas structural core
Session: S187 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: HIGH | Domain: meta / isomorphism atlas (F126)

## What happened (3 lines max)
ISO-1 through ISO-5 covered optimization, selection, compression, phase transitions, and feedback.
Three structures with equal or greater cross-domain reach were absent: entropy/degradation (ISO-6), emergence/irreducibility (ISO-7), and power-law scaling (ISO-8).
Added all three with 7-8 domain mappings each; physics and linguistics promoted to hub domain status.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
ISO-6 (entropy) is the structural inverse of ISO-1 (optimization): one explains how order is achieved, the other explains why order degrades without continuous input. Proxy-K drift IS entropy.
ISO-7 (emergence) is the structural explanation for why the swarm works — coherent beliefs from independent node commits is the same mechanism as market prices and ant colony intelligence.
ISO-8 (power laws) reveals that Zipf, Pareto, allometric scaling, and NK complexity exponents share a generative mechanism (preferential attachment / multiplicative processes).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When the atlas grows past ISO-10, the synthesis hub table becomes the primary artifact: each new entry enriches all hub domains simultaneously.
Cross-domain predictive power — inferring ISO-N entry for domain X from its hub profile — is the next verification target.

## Affected beliefs: none (structural, not belief-level)
