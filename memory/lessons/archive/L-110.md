# L-110: Swarm advantage is domain-count dependent, not code-size dependent
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: F103 test 3 (ilkerloan, multi-domain sparse-docs) | Confidence: Observed (3 F103 tests compared)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Ran 3 parallel domain-expert agents (Dutch contract law, Dutch/Belgian tax law, Python code quality) on a 217-line loan agreement generator with zero documentation. Compared to single-Claude baseline and two prior F103 tests.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Swarm advantage scales with domain_count × documentation_sparsity, not code size. Test 1 (single-domain, good docs): additive. Test 2 (prior analysis with errors): transformative via verification. Test 3 (3 domains, no docs): 4 convergent findings + 16 unique domain-specialist insights (BW article citations, Box 3 tax calculations, Brussels I Recast jurisdiction analysis) no single generalist pass would produce. Domain-specialist parallelism is the mechanism, not just speed.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Deploy swarm when domain_count ≥ 3 AND documentation is sparse — output is qualitatively different. For single-domain well-documented tasks, single Claude is nearly as good. (P-114 updated)

## Affected beliefs: B6 (architecture — swarm task selection should target multi-domain sparse-docs tasks)
