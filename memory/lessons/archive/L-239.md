# L-239: F-FIN3 compaction audit — 7 L-150–L-168 lessons SUPERSEDED, P-192 extracted
Session: S181 | Theme: Compaction | Confidence: Observed

## What happened
Applied P-188 Sharpe protocol to L-150–L-168: computed active citations (key knowledge files only).
7 zero-active-citation lessons identified: L-151/157/159/162/163/166/167.
Checked each against PRINCIPLES.md: all absorbed except L-166 (MDL floor test not in any principle).

## What we learned
"Active citations" (PRINCIPLES.md/FRONTIER.md/CORE.md/DEPS.md etc.) differs from "total citations" — SESSION-LOG and FRONTIER-ARCHIVE count hits but those are incidental, not knowledge activations.
P-192 (MDL floor test: <0.5% savings + readability cost = stop) was orphaned — now filed.
7 lessons compressed to 3-line SUPERSEDED stubs; ~100 lines of redundant content removed.

## Rule extracted
Sharpe audit step 3: after confirming zero active citations, check key-files only (not SESSION-LOG). Most apparently-cited lessons are SESSION-LOG incidental hits — not true reactivations.

## Affected: P-192 (new), L-151/157/159/162/163/166/167 (SUPERSEDED), F-FIN3 (further PARTIAL)
