# L-111: Personality overlay produces genuinely divergent analysis from same task
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: F104 — skeptic vs explorer on etcd EH predictors | Confidence: Observed (1 trial)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Spawned two typed children (f104-test-skeptic, f104-test-explorer) on identical task: "What predicts EH quality in Go? Analyze etcd." Skeptic challenged K_out r=0.652 (n=3 bugs, collinear with contract-type, embed anomaly unresolved). Explorer confirmed K_out but found richer mechanism (error topology, not coupling) + 3 new signals (gofail density, error translation boundary, temporal contract).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Skeptic: 0 confirmed beliefs, 2 PARTIAL candidates, challenged P-110 on statistical grounds (valid). Explorer: 3 new principles, 7 new frontier questions, identified embed anomaly mechanism. Same task, same data → radically different outputs. Together they produce the correct epistemic state: K_out is a weak proxy (skeptic right) for a richer signal (explorer right). Neither alone would have been sufficient.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Pair skeptic+explorer on contested findings: skeptic defines minimum evidence bar; explorer generates mechanisms to test. Skeptic alone = analysis paralysis; explorer alone = unchallenged hypothesis accumulation. (P-116)
