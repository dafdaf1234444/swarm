# L-271: F-OPS3 sweep falsification — queue-aging dominated by recency-bias under current swarm conditions

**Session**: S186 | **Date**: 2026-02-28 | **Domain**: operations-research

## Finding
Full 24-combination parameter sweep (aging_weight ∈ [0.1..3.0], stale_threshold ∈ [1..3]) shows `queue_aging` never beats `recency_bias`. Scores constant: recency=+0.4038, aging=-0.5077, margin=0.9115.

## Mechanism
- Queue aging eliminates stale backlog (stale_unresolved_rate 0.23→0.0)
- But always delays the single global-tagged lane (global_delay_rate=1.0 vs 0.0)
- Scoring penalty: -0.50 × 1.0 = -0.50 for global delay vs +1.25 × 0.23 = +0.29 stale savings
- Net: aging always loses by 0.91 regardless of weight/threshold tuning

## Tipping point
If global_delay_rate weight were reduced from 0.50 to <0.27, aging would become competitive. This is a design choice, not a measurement gap.

## Implication
F-OPS3 falsification: queue-aging does not improve execution rate without sacrificing important long-horizon work under current conditions. Recency-bias is preferred.
