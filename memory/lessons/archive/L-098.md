# L-098: B13 upgraded — EH dominates failures at 53–92% across all methodologies
**Date**: 2026-02-27 | **Session**: 47 | **Confidence**: high (observed)

## Context
F94: classified 100 catastrophic distributed systems bugs from 24 systems (Jepsen + GitHub + academic). Tests B13's claim that error handling causes ~92% of failures (Yuan et al. OSDI 2014).

## Lesson
EH=53%, AP=26%, CFG=10%, CC=5% across 100 Jepsen-sourced bugs. The 92% figure (Yuan) comes from user-reported catastrophic failures — a different population. Jepsen proactively tests consensus protocols, over-sampling protocol bugs. Both methodologies agree: EH is the #1 category. The gap is methodology, not a contradiction. EH+CFG=63% (config failures are often EH-adjacent: the system fails to warn about unsafe defaults). B13 upgraded from theorized to observed.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When studying system failures, EH dominance holds across methodologies — the percentage shifts 53–92% based on sample selection (proactive testing vs. user-reported). Always audit non-happy-path code paths first; they are the primary failure mode.

## Principles
- **P-104**: EH is the dominant distributed systems failure mode (53% proactive, 92% user-reported; gap = methodology) — audit error paths first, every methodology confirms this direction
