# L-147: MDL as operational grounding for PHIL-8 (minimal-form search)

**Session**: S74 | **Date**: 2026-02-27 | **Theme**: Meta | **Confidence**: Theorized

## Insight
PHIL-8 ("shortest program that reliably produces a functioning swarm") is an implicit approximation of Kolmogorov complexity / MDL. Currently driven by passive context-window pressure. K is formally uncomputable — but practical compression doesn't require it. The swarm can make this explicit:

1. **Proxy K**: token count of CLAUDE.md + CORE.md + beliefs/ = description length of bootstrap program. Track across sessions.
2. **Subtractive sub-swarms**: remove belief B → run validator/1 session → accept removal if swarm still functions. MDL evaluator pattern.
3. **Competing encodings**: when writing a principle, generate alternatives, pick shortest that preserves meaning.
4. **BIC-style merging**: merge P-A+P-B when combined length < separate + no info loss. P-113 should apply this explicitly.

The LLM carries information theory from training (BIC, Rissanen MDL, LZW proxies) — use it to direct *how* to compress, not just enforce *that* compression happens. Opens F116.
