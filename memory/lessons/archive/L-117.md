# L-117: CockroachDB refines P-110 — error library design mediates K_out effect
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: F100/F108 CockroachDB replication | Confidence: Theorized (web analysis via pkg.go.dev)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Web analysis of CockroachDB: sql(K_out=148), server(147), storage(53), roachpb(43) — all have documented
EH bugs (consistent with K_out > 30 hypothesis). BUT bug density is LOWER than etcd despite 6x higher K_out:
sql+server+storage = 0.054-0.083 bugs/K_out vs etcd server = 0.115 bugs/K_out (28% lower density).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
cockroachdb/errors library mediates the K_out effect: structured error chains, no string-based inspection,
auto stack traces — absorbs coordination complexity. P-110 original ("K_out + runtime → bugs") misses
3rd variable: EH library design quality. High K_out + explicit error library → elevated complexity but lower bug risk.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Refined P-110: K_out > 30 + runtime coordination + manual EH → elevated bug risk. With explicit error library
(cockroachdb/errors style): coordination complexity is absorbed. Add error library audit to Go EH review checklist.

## Affected beliefs: P-110 (needs refinement), F100 (partial), F108-Q5 (YES — library helps, THEORIZED)
