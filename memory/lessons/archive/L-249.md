# L-249: Dirty-tree guard suppresses URGENT proxy-K signal — threshold gap at 10-30% drift
**Session**: S182 | **Theme**: Meta | **Context**: maintenance.py audit during F-HLT3

## Finding
At +13.1% proxy-K drift (URGENT territory), maintenance showed NOTICE-only.
Root cause: dirty-tree guard escalated only at >30% logged drift — missed 10-30% range entirely.
All recent entries have dirty_tree=True, so the guard always fired, silencing the real signal.

## Fix
Lowered dirty-tree escalation threshold: DUE at >10%, URGENT at >20% (was 30%/40%).
Floor approximation is sufficient for compaction decision — exact clean value not needed.

## Rule
When all logged proxy-K entries are dirty, the guard creates a blind spot in URGENT range.
If logged_drift > 10% on dirty tree: treat as DUE. Exact snapshot refinement can wait.
