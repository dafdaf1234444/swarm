# L-113: Spawn budget is finite — optimize for learning diversity, not spawn count
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: Human directive (meta-swarming) | Confidence: Theorized → must test

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human pointed out: the swarm could spawn more children, smarter children, multiple children
learning different lessons simultaneously, a spawn process — but all within the limits of
reality. You can't spawn infinite children. You can't run them forever.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The right question at spawn time is not "how many?" but "what's the highest-information
partition of this task?" Each additional agent adds cost (context, compute, coordination).
The marginal value of the Nth agent is the probability it discovers something agents 1..N-1 miss.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Before spawning N agents: estimate the learning-diversity of the partition. Spawn the minimum
set that covers the task's independent dimensions. Don't add agents beyond the point where
expected findings converge. (P-118)

## Affected beliefs: B6 (architecture), F71 (spawn quality), F77 (spawn strategy self-improve)
