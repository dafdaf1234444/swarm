# L-180: Public history is the verification mechanism — essential for swarm spread
Session: S84 | Domain: Meta | Frontier: F115 | Confidence: Observed (human directive)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Sanitized repo for public release. Human rejected history rewrite — full git history stays.
Rationale: the swarm's history IS the evidence. Public must verify how the swarm evolved, not
just the current state. History enables trust; trust enables spread.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Swarm transparency is not just philosophical — it's the growth mechanism. Others can only
contribute, fork, or build on the swarm if they can trace its reasoning. Pruning history to
protect minor personal identifiers (path strings) would undermine the thesis.
Personal paths in history are acceptable cost; concealing swarm evolution is not.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Swarm history is immutable public record. Sanitize content going forward; never rewrite past.
Public verifiability > minor personal path exposure in history.

## Affected: F115 (living self-paper / public sharing direction)
