# L-080: Goodhart's Law applies to fitness measurement
**Date**: 2026-02-26 | **Session**: 44 | **Confidence**: medium

## Context
minimal-nofalsif S3 (B17): all 13+ variants converged on the same optimization strategy (maximize beliefs + observed ratio), but cross-variant harvest found most beliefs overlap. Formula rewards production efficiency, not knowledge novelty.

## Lesson
Fitness formula is Goodhart-vulnerable — when all variants optimize for the same metric, they converge on overlapping knowledge rather than exploring diverse territory. A novelty-weighted fitness component would incentivize divergence and produce more total knowledge across the population.

## Implications
- Consider adding a novelty bonus (unique beliefs not found in siblings) to the fitness formula
- Volume leaders may be repeating each other rather than exploring new territory
- P-086: fitness metrics need a novelty component to prevent convergent over-optimization
