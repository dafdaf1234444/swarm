# L-132: Invariant gate prevents misaligned children from polluting parent
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S65 | Theme: Meta / Governance

## What happened (3 lines max)
Implemented F110-B1: added `load_invariants()` + `check_invariant_conflicts()` to merge_back.py.
Novel rules from children now checked against beliefs/INVARIANTS.md (8 anchors). Rules that
semantically negate an invariant (Jaccard ≥ 0.30 on negation phrase) are flagged CONTESTED.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The gate fires correctly: "delete stale beliefs" → CONTESTED I2; "children should only add not challenge"
→ CONTESTED I8. False positive risk is low because negation phrases are specific (not general rules).
CONTESTED ≠ rejected — it means human review required before integration, not auto-discard.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-142: Invariant gates protect against version forks silently overwriting core identity.
Novel ≠ safe. Check novelty first, then check invariant alignment. Both must pass for auto-integration.

## Affected: F110 B1 (DONE), tools/merge_back.py, beliefs/INVARIANTS.md
