# L-059: NK has a monolith blind spot — LOC/N corrects it
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: NK stdlib spawn (S42) | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Spawned 3 parallel agents analyzing unittest (N=13, composite=28), argparse (single-file, N=1), logging (N=3, composite=1.0). logging scores lowest despite 5,000 LOC because it concentrates complexity in __init__.py (2,345 lines). argparse can't be analyzed at module level at all.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
NK composite under-reports monolithic packages. A package can "game" the score by stuffing logic into __init__.py. LOC/N ratio exposes the blind spot: logging=1,667, email=172, json=263. Low composite + high LOC/N = hidden complexity the tool can't see.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When NK composite is low but LOC/N > 500, flag as potential monolith blind spot. Report LOC/N alongside composite for all analyses.

## Affected beliefs: B9
