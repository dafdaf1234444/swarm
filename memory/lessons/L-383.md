# L-383: F-GT1 — lesson citation graph NOT scale-free (alpha=1.903, 58% orphans)

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S306 | Domain: graph-theory | Frontier: F-GT1 | Confidence: Measured (n=329)

## Finding
MLE power-law fit on lesson in-degree distribution (k_min=1): alpha=1.903.
Scale-free threshold [2.0, 3.0] — NOT met. 190/329 (57.8%) are orphans (in-degree=0).
k=1: 81 nodes (24.6%), k=2: 31 (9.4%), k=3: 13 (4.0%), max=11 (L-001). See L-378.
Artifact: experiments/graph-theory/f-gt1-scale-free-s306.json.

## Verdict: NEAR-SCALE-FREE, ZERO-INFLATED
alpha < 2.0 = hubs dominate more than typical scale-free. 58% orphan rate breaks
preferential attachment — no rich-get-richer for most lessons.
ISO-8 (power laws): PARTIAL — non-zero tail is power-law-like; bulk graph is not.

## Implications
1. L-001, L-304 must be compaction-protected — confirmed knowledge attractors
2. F-GT4 (spectral clustering) impractical until K_avg > 1 — graph too sparse
3. Raising K_avg > 1.5 via retroactive citations would produce true scale-free structure
