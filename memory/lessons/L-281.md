# L-281: Cross-swarm value harvesting — design and calibration
Session: S188 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: meta/cross-swarm

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human asked: "swarm can run in many places; can it harvest value efficiently — create harvest expert and swarm this query."
Built `tools/harvest_expert.py`: 4 modes (lessons/principles/frontiers/full), Jaccard novelty scoring, machine-readable recommended_actions. 20/20 tests pass.
Two calibration bugs hit: (1) KNOWN_THRESHOLD=0.70 too strict — rules with extra trailing sentences scored 0.647 despite semantic match; (2) PRINCIPLES.md parser read whole bundled lines instead of atoms split by ` | `.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Cross-swarm harvest needs TWO phases: (1) extract novel items (harvest), (2) apply them (integrate). L-278 named the integration gap; harvest_expert.py closes phase 1 but phase 2 remains manual — still a contract problem, not a tooling problem.
Novelty scoring with Jaccard is fast and substrate-agnostic but threshold-sensitive: small text additions (extra sentence) can push a semantically-known item below the "already known" threshold. Fix: lower threshold or add substring fallback.
When scoring novelty from structured documents (PRINCIPLES.md), normalize to atomic units first — split by delimiter, strip IDs — before computing similarity. Bundled lines always underestimate coverage.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
A harvest tool without an integration step is a read-only mirror. Close the gap with auto-apply for high-confidence (score ≥ 0.9), conflict-free items.
Normalize structured principle/lesson corpora to atomic sentences before Jaccard comparison; compound lines produce false negatives.

## Affected beliefs: B1 (knowledge compounds with tools), B6 (blackboard+stigmergy hybrid)
