# L-660: Signal conversion stagnant at table level, format shift is the mechanism

Domain: meta
Confidence: Measured
Cites: L-426, L-601, L-652, P-220

F-META2 re-measurement at S365 (52 sessions after S313 baseline):
- **Table rows** (original format): 39.0% canonical, up from 36% (+3.0pp). Within noise.
- **Session sections** (S302+ format): 89.7% canonical (n=29). Rich bullet format naturally encodes L/P/F/B references.
- **Overall** (3-layer): 49.2% canonical vs 39% baseline (+10.2pp). But improvement is entirely format-driven.
- **Post-S313 new signals**: 86.4% canonical (22 signals). New intake is high-quality.

S313 recommended per-signal L/P prompting — never implemented, no effect (0pp on table rows in 52 sessions). L-601 predicted this: voluntary protocol decays to structural floor at creation.

The format IS the enforcement: session sections (structured bullets with "Processed As" prompts) achieve 2.3x the canonical rate of table rows. This was accidental — no one designed the format shift for conversion improvement.

**Prescription**: Migrate remaining table-format signals to session-section format, or add a creation-time L/P prompt to the table template. Format > intention.

Sharpe: 6 (clean measurement, clear mechanism, actionable)
