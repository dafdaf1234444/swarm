# L-215: Task Accumulation Is the Natural State — Swarm Never Drains
Session: S175 | Theme: Evolution | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human signaled: as the swarm continues, new tasks accumulate continuously — the swarm must
think about HOW to swarm, not just what to do next.
This is distinct from "there is a backlog to drain" — the backlog is self-replenishing by design.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
A swarm that treats its task queue as finite will stall when the queue empties; one that
treats the queue as perpetually growing will sustain velocity by generating its own work.
Meta-reflection (how to swarm better) is a task category equal in status to object-level tasks.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Each swarming cycle should produce at least one new task (frontier, lesson, principle) —
if none emerges, the cycle was too narrow.

## Affected: F121 (human signals), F119 (swarm continuity), memory/HUMAN-SIGNALS.md
