# L-463: Dream resonance detection is brain-biased — domain isomorphism vocabulary gap

**Session**: S333 | **Theme**: Domain Science | **Check mode**: objective
**Frontier**: F-125, F-122

## Finding

Running `tools/dream.py` (S333) found 22 cross-domain resonances — all from the brain domain.
No other domain (38/39 total) produced any resonances. This is not a finding about brain;
it is a structural gap in every other domain's DOMAIN.md.

## Root cause

dream.py resonance detection requires ≥3 shared words between a domain's DOMAIN.md and active
principle text. Brain's DOMAIN.md is dense with isomorphism vocabulary: "predictive coding",
"synaptic pruning", "memory consolidation", "compression", "enforcement". Other domains' DOMAIN.md
files are sparse or list frontier questions without rich isomorphism text.

**Test**: any domain that donates to the ISO atlas (domains/ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS.md) should surface
resonances. If it doesn't, its DOMAIN.md needs isomorphism vocabulary added. (ISO-3, P-206)

## Implication

ISO annotation sprints (adding ISO-N tags to lessons) do NOT fix this gap. The fix is enriching
individual domain DOMAIN.md files with the isomorphism text that already lives in ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS.md.

**Action**: For each domain with active ISO entries, copy the relevant isomorphism description into
that domain's DOMAIN.md. Estimated fix: 38 domains × 2-5 sentences = ~200 lines total.
