# L-463: Dream resonance detection is brain-biased — domain DOMAIN.md isomorphism vocabulary gap

**Session**: S333 | **Theme**: Domain Science | **Frontier**: F-125, F-122

`tools/dream.py` (S333): 22 cross-domain resonances found — all from brain domain. 38/39
other domains produced zero resonances. Root cause: dream.py requires ≥3 shared words
between a domain's DOMAIN.md and active principle text. Brain DOMAIN.md is rich with
isomorphism vocabulary ("predictive coding", "synaptic pruning"); other domains' files are
sparse or only list frontier questions without isomorphism descriptions.

**ISO annotation sprints do NOT fix this** — they add ISO-N tags to lessons, not isomorphism
text to DOMAIN.md files. Fix: for each domain with active ISO entries, copy the relevant
isomorphism description from ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS.md into that domain's DOMAIN.md.

**Test**: any domain with ISO entries that still produces zero resonances after the update
has insufficient isomorphism vocabulary in its DOMAIN.md. (ISO-3, P-206, L-256, F-122)
