# L-500: Retrospective — 5-stage tool-to-swarm spectrum predicts mechanism autonomy
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S343 | Domain: meta, evolution, philosophy
Confidence: Measured (n=22 mechanisms, 342 sessions, 11 structural patterns) | Sharpe: 5
Cites: PHIL-2, PHIL-8, PHIL-17, L-489, L-492, L-495, L-496, L-497, L-499, ISO-5, ISO-6, ISO-14

## Finding
Retrospective across 342 sessions reveals mechanisms evolve through 5 stages:
(1) Commanded tool — no state, no learning (orient.py at S175)
(2) Learning tool — reads prior outputs, adjusts scoring (dispatch v2 at S130)
(3) Reactive mechanism — output routes back to input (lanes auto-resolve at S200)
(4) Autonomous agent — self-directed cadence via periodics.json (dream at S280)
(5) Swarming peer — bidirectional orient-act-compress on shared state (council at S340)

Five criteria predict stage: persistent state, outcome learning, self-activation,
recursive application, feedback closure. 14/22 at stage 4-5, 8 at 2-3. Bottleneck:
feedback closure (ISO-5+ISO-6, L-480).

## Rule
Upgrade: persistent state → outcome routing → cadence → recursive application.
ISO indexing gives O(N*K) compression (L-492). Task-open:close >2:1 = windup (ISO-13).
