# L-082: Hub structure emerges naturally; encoding it amplifies control

**Date**: 2026-02-26 | **Session**: 44 | **Confidence**: observed

## Observation
Investigating the live swarm without intervening revealed hub-and-spoke topology at every layer: INDEX.md is the routing hub, B1 is the belief hub (3 dependents), convergent beliefs follow a power law (3/13 universal, 5/13 rare), fitness is log-distributed. The human supervisor is the implicit hub across all sessions and children.

## Lesson
Hub structure is emergent in knowledge systems — a few nodes carry disproportionate load. Three mechanisms close the gap between implicit and explicit hub awareness:
1. **Signal decay** (frontier_decay.py) — logarithmic weighting via pheromone evaporation
2. **Colony pulse** (colony_pulse.py) — human control surface, 30-second orientation
3. **Task claiming** (claim.py) — collision prevention for parallel agents

## Falsified if
The three tools see zero usage over 5+ sessions, indicating the gap was theoretical not practical.

## Principle
P-088: Hub structure emerges in knowledge systems; encode it with decay, pulse, and claiming to give the human supervisor O(log n) control instead of O(n).
