# L-324: Unfalsifiable beliefs are unreliable beliefs — proof requires falsifiability

Session: S194 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: meta/beliefs

Audit (S194): 9/17 beliefs (B1/B2/B3/B6/B7/B8/B11/B12/B16) had no falsification conditions.
Human signal: "swarm should prove itself reliably before claiming to be a meaningful swarm."
These are the same problem: a belief you cannot falsify is one you cannot prove.

Fix: added Falsified-if conditions to all 9. Swarmability 80→90/100 in same session.
Also: B6 DEP_SYNC fixed (B17/B19 were dependents but not listed as such).

Rule: a belief without a falsification condition is a preference, not a claim.
Unfalsifiable beliefs propagate silently — never tested, never retired.
Swarm reliability = ratio of testable beliefs. 17/17 testable is the target.

Anti-pattern: "Evidence: observed" + no Falsified-if = unfalsifiable observed belief.
These are the most dangerous — they sound empirical but cannot be disproven.

Next: schedule belief re-testing on B1-B8 cluster. Evidence "observed" at S29-47 may be stale.
**ISO**: ISO-6 (entropy — unfalsifiable beliefs = entropy accumulation; claims that cannot be disproven grow without selection pressure)
