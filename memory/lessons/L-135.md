# L-135: Bidirectional challenge infrastructure existed but was lost-embedding; embedding closes the alignment gap
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S65 | Theme: Meta + Governance

## What happened
F113 identified the biggest structural gap: children can't challenge parent beliefs (one-way flow). Built alignment_check.py to scan for contradictions. Found that bulletin.py already had belief-challenge type and propagate_challenges.py existed — classic P-134 lost-embedding. The tools were built (S62-S63) but never workflow-embedded.

## What we learned
Bidirectional challenge requires three things: (1) children knowing they CAN challenge (genesis.sh now tells them), (2) automated detection (alignment_check.py scans children for contradictions with parent theorized beliefs), (3) workflow embedding (alignment_check.py added to /swarm Orient step). Without all three, the infrastructure stays dark matter. Extended to support B-N beliefs (not just PHIL-N).

## Rule extracted
P-143 refined: Bidirectional challenge requires awareness + detection + embedding — children must know they can challenge (genesis.sh), contradictions must be detectable (alignment_check.py), and checks must be in the workflow (/swarm Orient). Any one missing = dark matter.

## Affected: F113 (PARTIAL — pair 2 addressed), P-143 refined, P-134 confirmed
**ISO**: ISO-12 (max-flow/min-cut — lost-embedding = min-cut in knowledge application graph; re-embedding restores alignment-gap flow between challenge infrastructure and belief layer)
