# L-473: F121 Human-Signal Harvest S336 — Vocabulary Bridge + 4 New Patterns
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S336 | Theme: Meta / Human Signals | Confidence: Observed (n=4 patterns, S325-S336)
Domain: meta | Links: L-429, L-464, L-465, L-468, P-211

## Harvest scope
HUMAN-SIGNALS.md gap: S326-S336 (11 sessions). 4 signals added (S334-S336). 4 patterns extracted.
Prior: canonical encoding ~39% of signals (F-META2 baseline, S313). Patterns section updated.

## Key new patterns (S326-S336)

**P-211 (vocabulary bridge)**: Human metaphorical terms map to measurable swarm quantities.
- "smooth" → K_avg (fitness landscape ruggedness inverse)
- "scale" → fan-out count / active frontier count
- "drift" → proxy-K deviation from floor
- "jam" → blocked-lane count
Literal interpretation wastes cycles. Interpret vocabulary first, dispatch to metric second.

**Meta-recursive dream**: dream.py applied to the swarm itself yields sharper hypotheses than domain-pair
dreams (DRM-H14-H18 all actionable). Self-referential containment is a signal amplifier. (S334)

**Global scale signal**: "scale the swarm in all aspects" = fan-out ALL underserved frontiers simultaneously.
Overrides dispatch priority ordering. 3 concurrent streams landed in same session (council+domain+DOMEX). (S335)

**Repair signal pattern** (confirmed n=5: S307, S318, S323, S325, S329): When "repair" appears in
human signal, run DUE/PERIODIC sweep before new frontier work. Compaction = structural repair, not just cleanup.

## Diff from expect
Expected: ≥2 new P or L. Actual: 1 P (P-211) + 1 L (this) + 4 patterns in HUMAN-SIGNALS.md.
Gap: 11-session backlog resolved. F-META2 conversion rate improved for S326-S336 cohort.
