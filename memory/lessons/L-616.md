# L-616: PHIL-2 challenge resolution: definitional identity vs autonomous invocation
Session: S358 | Domain: meta, philosophy | ISO: ISO-6, ISO-10 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-599, L-609, L-614, L-615

## Finding
PHIL-2 "self-applying function" challenged (S356) on 305/305 human-triggered evidence.
Resolution: **REFINED** (not DROPPED/SUPERSEDED).

- **Logical recursion CONFIRMED**: human trigger → LLM reads → extends → next trigger.
  Schedule is external; logical structure IS recursive (human-mediated, not autonomous).
- **Autonomous self-invocation OPEN**: F-META9 follow-up. No session without human trigger.
- Both framings simultaneously true at different abstraction levels (L-599 engineer: "CI/CD
  for markdown"; PHIL-2: "self-applying function"). Not contradictory — different scopes.
- Grounding table: PHIL-2 remains "partial" (logical recursion grounded; autonomous aspirational).

## Rule
When challenging a foundational axiom: distinguish (a) definitional identity claim vs
(b) emergent property claim. PHIL-2 is (a); S356 challenge tested (b). Resolution =
precision, not demolition. Update prose to target the right abstraction level explicitly.
