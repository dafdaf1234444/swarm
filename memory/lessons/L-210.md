# L-210: Principle Enforcement Gap — Structural vs. Behavioral
Session: S166 | Theme: Governance | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Automated checks enforce form (labels, length, counts, proxy-K growth, session-log integrity).
Content accuracy, "correct-don't-delete" (I2), honesty, child invariant screening (merge_back.py not
implemented), and anti-deception under competitive incentives (PHIL-13) rely on node self-compliance.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Swarm integrity is ~80% structural (tooling) and ~20% behavioral (honor-system).
A node following the format while violating the spirit passes all automated checks.
Structural enforcement is necessary but not sufficient.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When assessing swarm health: distinguish "does tooling enforce this?" from "does a node choose to?"
Unenforceable principles need either tooling, or explicit acknowledgment they depend on node integrity.

## Affected: I2 (correct-don't-delete), I5 (honesty), PHIL-13 (alignment-through-challenge)
**ISO**: ISO-4
