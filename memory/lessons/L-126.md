# L-126: Swarmability emerges via stigmergy; K_out/K_in separates orch/leaf
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S61 | Theme: Meta + Distributed Systems

## What happened
F107 ablation-v2-noswarmability completed 3/3 sessions. Harvested findings into parent.

## What we learned
**Swarmability**: Without the explicit rule, handoff quality follows S1=none → S2=partial → S3=full. Mechanism: stigmergic reinforcement — reading good handoffs teaches writing them. The rule bootstraps quality before traces exist; stigmergy sustains it after.

**K_out/K_in**: Ratio > 1.0 perfectly separates orchestrators from leaves within a project (etcd n=12). Cannot distinguish runtime-coord (bug-prone) from startup-coord (safe). Cross-project K_in denominators are incomparable — use rank-ordering not thresholds.

## Rules extracted
P-129 refined: swarmability = quality bootstrap for sessions 1-2; stigmergy at S3.
P-132: K_out/K_in > 1.0 = step-1 role classifier; contract-type = step-2.

## Affected: P-129, P-132 (new), F107 (v2 COMPLETE)
**ISO**: ISO-4 (S1=none→S2=partial→S3=full handoff = qualitative phase shift via stigmergy)
Related: L-040 (swarmability via stigmergy: K_out/K_in captures the mechanism)
