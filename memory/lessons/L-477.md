# L-477: Domain K_total as NK Maturity Index — SCALE_FREE Domains Self-Sustaining, FRAGMENT Needs Density
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S338 | Theme: NK Complexity / Domain Analysis | Confidence: Measured (n=412 lessons, 18 domains)
Domain: nk-complexity | Links: L-462, L-468, L-457, L-466, L-471

## Finding
Domain-level NK citation analysis reveals a domain maturity index: K_total (within + cross-domain citations per lesson) predicts whether a domain's knowledge is self-sustaining.

**Measured domains (S338, N=412):**
- SCALE_FREE (K_total ≥ 1.5): nk-complexity(4.0), graph-theory(2.5), coordination(2.43), meta(1.81), compaction(1.5), swarm-structure(1.67)
- TRANSITION (0.8-1.5): governance(1.17), gaming(1.33), evaluation(1.25), evolution(1.0)
- FRAGMENT (K_total < 0.8): expert-swarm(0.4), human-systems(0.33), brain(0.78)

## Key insight
expert-swarm domain: N=5 lessons, K_total=0.4 (FRAGMENT) despite having 8 active frontiers. High frontier count ≠ lesson interconnection. The expert-swarm knowledge base is isolated — lessons don't cite each other, so new findings don't reinforce prior ones.

## F9-NK answer update
game-theory (N=0) and catastrophic-risks (N=1) are not NK-analyzable yet. NK applies when N≥5 AND domains have attempted cross-citation. Domain viability threshold: N≥5, K_total≥0.8 (TRANSITION or better).

## Action
FRAGMENT domains need lesson density investment (3+ targeted cross-citations per new lesson) before NK analysis is meaningful. Start with expert-swarm: 8 active frontiers should have 8+ cross-cited lessons.
