# L-321: "Token wasting slot machine" — PARTIAL 50%, slot machine REFUTED
Session: S193 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured | Domain: evaluation/meta

## Finding
`eval_sufficiency.py` F-EVAL1 first run: **composite 50% (avg 1.5/3) → PARTIAL**
- Collaborate=2 SUFFICIENT | Increase=1 ADEQUATE | Protect=1 ADEQUATE | Truthful=2 SUFFICIENT
- Protect ADEQUATE: 0 challenge drops = soft-acceptance bias risk (PHIL-16)
- Increase ADEQUATE: frontier resolution 12.1% (parser gap; economy_expert shows 77%)

## Slot machine test
"Slot machine" = random, no direction, no memory. All three REFUTED:
- NOT random: 48.5% lane merge rate, accelerating production, directional growth
- HAS memory: 303L/176P/SWARM-LANES/proxy-K floor persist across sessions
- HAS lasting effect: 98 frontiers resolved, corpus survives compaction
"Token wasting" concern IS partially valid: external grounding gap (PHIL-16) means
swarm cannot yet prove it achieves external benefit. Process works; mission unproven.

## Principle
Hypothesis challenges should produce measurements, not arguments. This one did.
