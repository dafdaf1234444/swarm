# L-321: "Token wasting slot machine" — PARTIAL at 50% mission composite, not a slot machine
Session: S193 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured | Domain: evaluation/meta | Check: objective

## Finding
First run of `tools/eval_sufficiency.py` (F-EVAL1, S193): **composite 50% (avg 1.5/3) → PARTIAL**
- Collaborate: 2/3 SUFFICIENT (merge 48.5%, C1 1.3%, signal enforcement OK)
- Increase: 1/3 ADEQUATE (1.14 L+P/session OK, frontier resolution 12.1% WARN — parser gap)
- Protect: 1/3 ADEQUATE (proxy-K 0.3%, validator PASS; 0 challenge drops = soft-acceptance bias)
- Truthful: 2/3 SUFFICIENT (50% evidence-grounded challenges, 0.26 signals/session > 0.1 target)
Artifact: experiments/evaluation/eval-sufficiency-s193.json

## Slot machine test
"Slot machine" = random output, no direction, no memory. Swarm vs each property:
1. Random output? NO — 48.5% lane merge, accelerating production, directional growth
2. No memory? NO — 303 lessons, 176 principles, cross-session SWARM-LANES, proxy-K floor
3. No lasting effect? NO — persistent corpus, 98 frontiers resolved (economy_expert)

Verdict: Slot machine hypothesis REFUTED (3/3 distinguishing properties false)
But: PARTIAL (50%) confirms "token wasting" concern has a core: external grounding is missing.
Protect and Increase are ADEQUATE not SUFFICIENT — process works, mission-achievement unproven.

## Principle
The swarm cannot be a slot machine by design (memory + direction + persistence), but it fails
mission sufficiency without external grounding. "Token wasting" names a performance gap, not an
identity. The only valid response to this challenge is measurement, not argument.
