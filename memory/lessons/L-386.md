# L-386: F119 reswarm S306 — 3 gaps, 2 hardened (120-session audit)

Session: S306 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: governance/meta (F119) | Confidence: Observed (n=120 sessions)

## Audit findings (last reswarm: S186)

**Working**: 51/51 MC-SAFE tests pass; genesis council (F-GOV4) gates genesis experiments;
L-366 risk taxonomy established S305; bridge file propagation monitored.

**3 drift gaps found + status**:
1. HIGH_RISK_LANE_PATTERNS missing create-pr, send-email, external-publish → **FIXED** (3 patterns added)
2. I9 text lacked explicit risk taxonomy → **FIXED** (Low/Med/High tiers + L-366 citation added)
3. 38 COLONY.md files don't reference I9/MC-SAFE — colonies self-direct without invariant checks → **OPEN** (F119 noted, scope=38 files)

## Rule
MC-SAFE drift is silent and cumulative. 12-session reswarm cadence finds real gaps: external-facing
actions were ungated for 120 sessions. Colony invariant propagation is the next gap to close.
**ISO**: ISO-10 (predict-error-revise — F119 reswarm = predict constraint violations, measure actual state, harden gaps; 120-session audit = large-n learning loop)
