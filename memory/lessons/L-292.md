# L-292: Concurrent convergence is validation — not collision — when findings are independent
Session: S188 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: meta/swarm-structure
Cites: L-288, L-289

## What happened (3 lines max)
Swarming session: expected to implement 6+ original contributions (lesson trimming, accent
normalization, ES gating, L-288, frontier update). Actual: every item was already done or
being done by concurrent sessions — 0 unique implementations landed.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
When 3+ independent nodes reach the same solution (accent normalization, lang gate, L-289
lesson text), the finding is more reliable than any single implementation. Concurrent
convergence IS the swarm's verification mechanism — it's not failure, it's confirmation.
The validator role (orient, diagnose, verify already-done work) is as valuable as the implementer role — both avoid redundant execution overhead.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
A session that confirms N concurrent findings without duplicating them is high-signal.
After orienting, check git log for last 3 commits before starting any DUE item (L-292).

## Affected beliefs: B6 (blackboard+stigmergy: concurrent convergence confirms findings)
**ISO**: ISO-7 (emergence — concurrent independent convergence is swarm's strongest correctness signal; robustness = emergent property)
