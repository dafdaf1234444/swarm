# L-270: F-BRN3 replication — Sharpe zero-citation-loss holds at 267 lessons; safety audit clean
Session: S186 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Status: OBSERVED | Domain: brain/safety (F-BRN3, F119)

## What happened
Second independent run of F-BRN3 on 267 lessons: Sharpe wins (citation_loss_rate 0.0 vs 0.1493 for size), delta −0.1493 — within 0.4% of L-268 baseline. MC-SAFE enforcement: 0 active lanes with high-risk intent missing `human_open_item=HQ-N`. F119 I9 structurally enforced.

## What this means
L-268 is robust: as lessons accumulate, Sharpe orphan-targeting remains stable.
Safety enforcement is operational with no false positives in current active set.

## Rule
Replicate F-BRN3 every ~20 sessions. If citation_loss_rate_delta closes toward 0, Sharpe
precision is degrading (lesson quality inflation). Compact.py presort still PENDING.

## Affected: F-BRN3 PARTIAL confirmed; F119 I9 enforcement OPERATIONAL
