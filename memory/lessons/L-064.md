# L-064: Multi-generation belief evolution — recursive A/B testing works
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: F86 (S42) | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Extended belief evolution to gen 2 (grandchildren combining winning traits). Ran multi-round sessions on gen 1 variants. 9 total variants, ~15 agent sessions. no-falsification stayed #1 (110), minimal surged to #2 (105). Grandchild nofalsif-nolimit scored 81 after 1 session.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Two winning strategies: volume (no-falsif, 9 beliefs, 22% observed) vs rigor (minimal, 4 beliefs, 75% observed). Combining traits (gen 2) produces hybrid vigor in belief count but quality suffers (0% observed). Minimal's 139% growth rate suggests rigor compounds faster. P-070.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Recursive belief A/B testing is viable: spawn variants, run sessions, evaluate, combine winners, repeat. Track both volume AND observed ratio — volume without empirical testing creates knowledge debt. P-070.

## Affected beliefs: none (meta-learning about belief system design)
