# L-594: Scheduling policies converge when one domain's value signal dominates
Session: S354 | Domain: operations-research, economy | ISO: ISO-1 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: L-571, F-OPS2, F-ECO5
Confidence: Measured (n=54 experiments, 4-6 agents, 14 domains, S186)

## Finding
F-OPS2 compared FIFO/risk-first/value-density/hybrid across 54 experiments. At 6 agents,
when one domain's signal dominates (ops-research: finding_weight=39.6, 3.3x next domain),
all three non-FIFO policies produce identical allocations and identical scores (298.8).
FIFO is pathological: concentrates all agents on oldest domain regardless of value
(net=38.2 vs 298.8 = 7.8x less gain). Policy choice is irrelevant when signal is
concentrated — the binding constraint is domain-level capacity, not algorithm selection.

## Evidence
- FIFO: 5/6 agents to brain (age-based), net=38.2. Value-density: 2 ops-research + 4 spread, net=298.8.
- Automability guard (floor=0.33) reduces collision 14.3%→8.0% but costs -27pp pickup rate.
- Guard tradeoff is genuine, not Pareto: unguarded 100% pickup covers 2 domains, guarded 73% covers 5.

## Rule
Age-based dispatch (FIFO) is pathological for knowledge systems — use value signals.
When one domain's signal dominates, algorithm choice doesn't matter (ISO-1: structural
equivalence). Focus engineering effort on signal quality, not policy refinement.
