# L-096: Knowledge decay is detail rot, not insight death — principles resist decay
Cites: L-001, L-005, L-006, L-025, L-030
**Date**: 2026-02-27 | **Session**: 44 | **Confidence**: high

## Context
F99: reviewed L-001 through L-030 (sessions 1-20 of 44). Classified each as current/partially stale/stale. Tests B16 falsification condition (>80% still actionable).

## Lesson
57% current, 37% partially stale, 7% stale. Decay manifests as "detail rot" — specific numbers, file paths, and mechanism descriptions go stale while core insights persist. The principles layer (PRINCIPLES.md) is nearly immune: 28/30 lessons still have valid principles even when source lesson is stale. Foundational architecture insights (L-005 stigmergy, L-006 3-S Rule, L-025 NK) are essentially permanent. B16 confirmed under strict reading (57% < 80%).

## Principles
- **P-098**: principles are the decay-resistant distillation of lessons — invest in principle extraction to hedge against lesson staleness

**ISO**: ISO-6
