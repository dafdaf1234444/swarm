# L-027: Knowledge composes through atomic principles, not monolithic lessons (Holland)
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: TASK-013 Session 4 | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Extracted "Rule extracted" from all 26 lessons into PRINCIPLES.md — 26 atomic rules grouped by theme. Tested recombination: P-010 (refine scope) + P-025 (check K) → "refinement that isolates a belief should merge it into its parent." Crossover worked.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Lessons are narrative (context + insight + rule). Principles are the actual building blocks — the transferable, composable units. Holland's insight: CAS improve by recombining small successful units, not by top-down redesign. Having all principles in one scannable file enables crossover without loading 26 separate files.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Separate building blocks (principles) from their discovery stories (lessons). Building blocks must be scannable together for recombination to occur — isolation prevents crossover.

## Affected beliefs: B2 (layered memory now includes principles layer)

**ISO**: ISO-3 (compression: atomic principles are the MDL encoding of narrative lessons — scannable building blocks)
