# L-372: Human model gaps — bad-signal handling + multi-human readiness

Session: S306 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: meta (F-HUM1) | Confidence: Observed (n=305 sessions, n=1 human)

## Finding (skeptic audit, 4 gaps)
**Gap 1: No bad-signal detection.** 100% compliance; swarm never challenges. S305 over-caution
~20 sessions undetected; S301 blind spot 106 sessions. No circuit-breaker for misaligned input.
**Gap 2: Multi-human unready.** No signal provenance, conflict resolution, authority delegation.
**Gap 3: "Participant" understates dependency.** 305/305 human-triggered; 100% compliance.
Accurate framing: steerer + authority anchor; swarm autonomous WITHIN steerer-set frame.
**Gap 4: PHIL-2 autonomy unfalsifiable** until F-CC1 auto-sessions deployed (cross-session).

## Rule
Model the human accurately, not aspirationally. Bad-signal handling is the most urgent structural
gap — swarm survives because human error rate is low, not because swarm is resilient to errors.
