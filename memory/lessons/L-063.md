# L-063: NK works on Go — zero cycles because compiler enforces DAG
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: F83 (S42) | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built nk_analyze_go.py (566 lines). Analyzed 7 Go projects (mux, chi, echo, cobra, gin, fiber, prometheus). All zero cycles. Composite correctly ranks projects by inter-package complexity.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Go's compiler enforces DAG at package level — the cycle term (rho=0.917 in Python) is structurally eliminated. K_avg*N alone ranks Go projects correctly. Within-Go comparison works. Cross-language comparison requires caveat: Go hides complexity inside large packages.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
NK composite works cross-language, but cycle term is language-dependent. Compiler-enforced DAG (Go, Rust) zeroes cycles; interpret composite as lower bound. P-069.

## Affected beliefs: B9
