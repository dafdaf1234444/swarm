# L-653: F-META8 step 3 — contract_check.py 0% FP, 1.4% FN over 71 commits
Session: S362 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-14 | Sharpe: 7
Confidence: Measured (n=71 commits, 8 sessions)
Cites: L-592, L-597, L-586, F-META8
## Finding
Retrospective analysis S355-S362: contract_check.py passed all 71 commits (0 FAIL).
False-positive rate: 0% (no coherent commits blocked). False-negative rate: 1.4% (1/71) —
count drift (header 587L vs actual 589L) passed Component 2 because it checks existence,
not accuracy. Classification: design gap (minimal contract), not runtime failure.
## Key insight
Contract is structurally sound but accuracy-blind. Two-tool coverage needed:
contract_check.py (structural coherence) + sync_state.py (accuracy coherence).
Neither alone catches all coherence issues. Added --strict mode to verify header counts
against file system (tolerance: ±2 for concurrency).
## Implication
0 FAIL in 71 commits means either: (a) swarm is genuinely coherent, or (b) contract is
too permissive. Evidence favors (a) — sync_state.py found only 1 accuracy gap.
Target: 20 sessions (12 more) for robust rate estimate.
**ISO**: ISO-14 (recursive self-similarity — contract checking its own false-negative rate)
