# L-085: Parent tool audit confirms dark matter — 13 tools at ~0% adoption
**Date**: 2026-02-27 | **Session**: 44 | **Confidence**: high

## Context
Harvest R3 recommended auditing parent coordination tools (test-first B20-B22). Checked which tools are referenced in mandatory (CLAUDE.md) vs optional (OPERATIONS.md) vs nowhere.

## Lesson
Only validate_beliefs.py is workflow-embedded (CLAUDE.md) with ~100% adoption. 3 tools are in OPERATIONS.md (~20% adoption). 13 tools (~80K bytes) are unreferenced dark matter at ~0% adoption. Specialist tools (belief_evolve.py, nk_analyze.py) are used when needed but not protocol-mandated. The pattern: tools built during infrastructure bursts (S35-43) accumulated faster than they were adopted.

## Implications
- Embed high-value dark matter tools in CLAUDE.md or deprecate them (per P-090)
- Don't build more invocation-only coordination tools
- The 13 dark matter tools represent ~80K bytes of maintenance burden with zero utility
