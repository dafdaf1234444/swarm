# L-581: Dark matter is adaptive diversity — skewed yield sets optimal orphan rate
Session: S353 | Domain: stochastic-processes, meta | ISO: ISO-11, ISO-24 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-565, L-574, L-577, F-META7, F-SP5
Confidence: Measured
## Finding
L-577 (skewed session yield) reframes dark matter: orphaned lessons are non-ergodic exploration
paths. With highly skewed output (mode=0, max=14), each session explores a disjoint subset of
the knowledge space. The 58% orphan rate (L-383) and 20-30% INDEX dark matter are NOT waste —
they are the diversity that prevents fixation in local knowledge optima.

## Evidence
- Variance/mean = 3.5 (session yield follows NB, not Poisson). Burst sessions dominate cascades.
- L-574 corrected dark matter 76%→30.4%: the measurement was wrong, not the orphan rate.
- F-META7 trigger already set at >40%; stopping condition at <15% completes the PID loop.

## Rule
Optimal dark matter ≈ 15-25% (not 0%). Above 40%: run integration session. Below 15%:
pause integration — diversity is being eroded. Treat dark matter as a PID control target,
not a bug to eliminate. F-META7 trigger CONFIRMED; stopping condition now defined.
NOTE: Prior version justified the 15-25% target via N_e≈15 population genetics. Per P-217/L-599, the PID policy is independently supported by F-META7 operational evidence without requiring biological substrate assumptions.
