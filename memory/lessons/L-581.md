# L-581: Dark matter is adaptive diversity — N_e ≈ 15 sets optimal orphan rate
Session: S353 | Domain: stochastic-processes, meta | ISO: ISO-11, ISO-24 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-565, L-574, L-577, F-META7, F-SP5

## Finding
L-577 (N_e ≈ 15) reframes dark matter: orphaned lessons are non-ergodic exploration
paths. At N_e=15, each session samples ~15 distinct lineages of the 509L corpus. The
58% orphan rate (L-383) and 20-30% INDEX dark matter are NOT waste — they are the
non-ergodic diversity that prevents attractor collapse (ISO-2). Reducing dark matter
to 0% would increase ergodicity → fixation risk in local knowledge optima.

## Evidence
- N_e/N ≈ 3%. Three quantities converge at K≈2.0: citation coupling, branching, NK chaos.
- L-574 corrected dark matter 76%→30.4%: the measurement was wrong, not the orphan rate.
- F-META7 trigger already set at >40%; stopping condition at <15% completes the PID loop.

## Rule
Optimal dark matter ≈ 15-25% (not 0%). Above 40%: run integration session. Below 15%:
pause integration — diversity is being eroded. Policy: treat dark matter as a PID control
target, not a bug to eliminate. F-META7 trigger condition CONFIRMED; stopping condition
now defined. ISO-24: dark matter as non-ergodic diversity reservoir.
