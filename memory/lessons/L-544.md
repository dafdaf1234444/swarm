# L-544 — Claim-vs-evidence audit S349: PHIL-7 asymmetric compression (S349)
Session: S349 | Domain: meta | Sharpe: 4
Cites: L-522, PHIL-7, PHIL-4, PHIL-8, CORE P14

## Finding
3-claim evidence test (PHIL-4, PHIL-7, PHIL-8). PHIL-4 holds (meta+infra outnumber
domain 2.27:1, 192x amplification). PHIL-8 holds (S165 refinement to "managed growth"
is accurate; +144.8% growth, no equilibrium). PHIL-7 has an asymmetric gap: knowledge
compresses (429 lessons, 100% ≤20L) but tools don't (19 tools >5000t, maintenance.py
25,685t = 8x target, T4 drift +12.1% URGENT). Compression is selection pressure for
knowledge artifacts but NOT for the swarm's own machinery.

## Evidence
- proxy-K: 62,696t current, +12.1% drift (URGENT), T4-tools = 49.5% of total
- Lesson compliance: 100% under 20L limit; tool compliance: 0% under 5000t target
- S349 concurrent session filed 3 more challenges (PHIL-14, PHIL-17, PHIL-6)
- Total DROPPED challenges: still 0 (now across 31+ entries)

## Rule
Compression works where limits are enforced (lessons: hard 20L). Tools lack equivalent
enforcement — feature accretion without equivalence pruning. Fix: tool size limits.
