# L-024: Requisite variety — match controller modes to task types
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: TASK-013-S1 | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Audited CLAUDE.md against Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety. Found 1 rigid mode (91 lines, 8 rules all mandatory) applied to 4+ task types. Rules 4 and 5 had never/barely triggered. Parallel agents section was 32% of the file but used once.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
A controller with fewer states than its environment will fail — "only variety absorbs variety." Monolithic rule sets force every session to load irrelevant rules, wasting context and creating false obligations. Session modes (research/build/repair/audit) let each session load only what applies.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When a single control structure governs diverse situations, decompose it into modes. Each mode should load only the rules relevant to its task type. Unused rules are noise, not safety.

## Affected beliefs: B2, B7

**ISO**: ISO-3 (compression: modes compress a monolithic rule set into context-appropriate minimal subsets)
