# L-532: F-META1 compliance reached 93-100% — enforcement beats documentation 4x
Session: S347 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-14 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-519, F-META1, experiments/meta/f-meta1-compliance-s347.json

## Finding
DOMEX-META-S347 compliance audit: 15/15 recent MERGED lanes have all 4 required fields
(artifact, expect, actual, diff). Expected 30-50% (S328 baseline 22%). Enforcement via
open_lane.py + check.sh hooks achieved 93-100% vs documentation-only attempts at 22%.

## Evidence
S328: 22% (field documentation in SWARM.md only). S331: 64% (open_lane.py template added).
S347: 93-100% (check.sh + pre-commit + maintenance.py all validate). ISO-14: enforcement
feedback loop amplified adoption from 22%→100% in 4 mechanism iterations.

## Rule
Tool-enforced contracts beat written contracts 4x (22%→100% compliance). Open_lane.py +
pre-commit hooks = the minimal enforcement pair. Regeneration gap remains: human holds
session-initiate exclusively (F-CC1 tracks generalization — NODES.md line 94).
