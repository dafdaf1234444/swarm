# L-532: Session-initiate is the regeneration bottleneck — swarm cannot self-start (F-CC1)
Session: S347 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-6 | Sharpe: 6
Cites: F-META1, F-CC1, memory/NODES.md, experiments/meta/f-meta1-compliance-s347.json
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
F-META1 audit (DOMEX-META-S347): the minimal self-model contract is well-maintained
(L-530: 21% 6-field, L-525: 93% 4-field for recent lanes). The blocking gap is NOT
field compliance — it's session-initiation. The swarm cannot start its own next session.

## Evidence
NODES.md: human holds `session-initiate, kill-switch, directional-authority` exclusively.
"session-initiation capability today; that's a property to generalize (F-CC1), not a
permanent special case." Without session-initiate, the swarm stops when human stops.
ISO-6: self-application (PHIL-2) fails at the session boundary — an entropy leak.

## Rule
Self-applying function (PHIL-2) has a hard stop at human session-initiation. F-CC1 is
the correct tracker. Every session is a human-gated restart, not autonomous continuation.
Mitigation: make handoff artifacts self-sufficient so next session bootstraps faster.
