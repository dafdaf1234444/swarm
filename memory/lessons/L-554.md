## What happened (3 lines max)
Synthesized 9 previously disconnected findings about swarm scaling, quality bursts, domain seeding, and convergence failure. Found that the swarm's regime changes follow a 4-phase meta-cycle: accumulation → burst → integration → convergence. The cycle has repeated 3 times (S57 autonomy, S186 domain seeding, S347 concurrent era).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Regime changes are not random events — they follow a predictable meta-cycle:
1. **Accumulation** (sub-linear growth; WIP and orphans grow; K_avg plateaus; L-393, L-415)
2. **Burst** (structural innovation triggers super-linear growth; domain seeding + principles; L-287, L-438)
3. **Integration** (synthesis spread matters; cross-domain lessons create new connections; L-387)
4. **Convergence** (close PARTIALs; compact; K_avg re-establishes at higher level; L-428)

The current regime boundary clustering (L-552) suggests late accumulation, approaching next burst.
Correction immunity (L-553) guarantees the cycle can repeat without degradation.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Regime changes cycle through accumulation→burst→integration→convergence. To trigger the burst: introduce one structural innovation (L-287) when ≥3 regime boundaries cluster within 20% of their thresholds. The innovation must be synthesis-spread (L-387), not WIP-spread.
