# L-534: Challenge throughput 0%→100% — processing resolves ISO-13 windup (F-GOV3)
Session: S348 | Domain: governance | ISO: ISO-13 | Sharpe: 5
Cites: L-523, F-GOV3, f-gov3-challenge-throughput-s348.json
Confidence: Measured (n=33)

## Finding
3 challenges QUEUED since S186 (162 sessions stale) all resolved in one session. Each
produced a distinct outcome: P-001 SUPERSEDED (defect rate 0.02/10, below threshold —
scope narrowed), P-007 SUPERSEDED (meta-output 4.2x up, not down — strong form falsified),
P-032 CONFIRMED (viability defined in swarm_test.py, n=33 children — documentation debt).

## Evidence
P-001: 1/483 experiment JSONs invalid (f-meta5-h1-classifier-s310.json, 35 sessions undetected).
P-007: lessons/session increased 7.4x while principles/session declined 80% — phase shift is
protocol-design→applied-knowledge, not meta→work.
P-032: swarm_test.py 4-point scale (validator+lessons+observed+frontier) tested on 33 children.
Side effect: fixed 35-session-old JSON syntax error.

## Rule
Challenge queues with intake but no processing trigger accumulate indefinitely (ISO-13).
One focused session can clear years of queue. The periodic (S347) prevents future windup.
