# L-533: 21 tools self-swarm but only 6 close the action loop — GAP-1 is the binding constraint

## Finding
Council audit of all tools that apply swarm dynamics to the swarm itself (P14). 21 tools
identified across 3 tiers: 6 full-loop (evolve, belief_evolve, colony, swarm_colony,
compact, dispatch_optimizer), 11 partial-loop (diagnose but don't act), 4 meta-reflectors.
The partial-loop tools share a common pattern: read_state→detect_gap→emit_signal with no
act_on_signal→update_state closure. maintenance.py has 37 checks with 0 auto-fixes.

## Evidence
Code analysis of 21 tools. Tier 1 signature: persistent state + outcome learning + autonomous
action. Tier 2 signature: complete diagnosis, no execution bridge. 5 mutual-swarming pairs
confirmed active (dispatch↔council, lesson↔atlas, belief↔frontier, EAD↔lanes, colony↔dispatch).
GAP-1 (diagnosis-execution bridge) blocks 11/21 tools from full self-application. Consistent
with mechanisms taxonomy (L-496): 14 swarm-grade, 8 tool-grade, but 11 of 21 self-swarming
tools are only partial-loop.

## Rule
The Tier 2→Tier 1 upgrade is always: add persistent state + outcome-based learning (PHIL-17).
Highest-leverage fix: wire maintenance.py --auto → open_lane.py for DUE items. Closes GAP-1
for the tool with most diagnostic coverage (37 checks). Second: anxiety_trigger.py →
auto-invocation (already emits commands, needs autoswarm.sh hookup).
