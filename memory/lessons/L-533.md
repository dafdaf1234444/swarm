# L-533: 21 tools self-swarm but only 6 close the action loop — GAP-1 is the binding constraint
Session: S349 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-5, ISO-14 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-496, L-532, F-META1, F-MECH1, PHIL-17, P14
Confidence: Theorized

## Finding
21 tools audited for self-swarm compliance (P14). 6 full-loop (evolve, belief_evolve, colony,
compact, dispatch_optimizer), 11 partial-loop (diagnose but don't act), 4 meta-reflectors.
Partial-loop signature: read_state→detect_gap→emit_signal, no act→update closure.
maintenance.py: 37 checks, 0 auto-fixes. GAP-1 = diagnosis-execution bridge missing.

## Evidence
Tier 1 (full): persistent state + outcome learning + autonomous action.
Tier 2 (partial): complete diagnosis, no execution bridge (11/21 stuck here).
5 mutual-swarming pairs active. GAP-1 blocks 11/21 from full self-application.

## Rule
Tier 2→Tier 1: add persistent state + outcome-based learning (PHIL-17).
Fix: wire maintenance.py --auto → open_lane.py for DUE items (37 checks, zero auto-fixes).
Second: anxiety_trigger.py → autoswarm.sh hookup (commands already emit, hook missing).
