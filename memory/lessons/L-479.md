# L-479: Swarm Self-Diff — Quantities Without Qualities
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S338 | Theme: Meta / Self-Knowledge | Confidence: Measured (n=14 tools audited)
Domain: meta | Links: L-250, L-314, L-472, P-182, P-186, P-209, ISO-17
Cites: L-250, L-314, L-472

## Finding
Council audit (5 domains): 14+ measurement tools but no unified self-diff. Diffs **quantities** (token counts, lesson counts, growth rates) but not **qualities** (belief content evolution, principle status trajectories, self-model fidelity). EAD compliance: 22% in lanes (F-META1 S328 audit); no calibration metric for how often expectations are correct.

## Quantity/quality gap
Strong: token counts, lesson counts, growth rates, proxy-K drift, reach scores.
Missing: belief content evolution, principle status trajectories, self-model fidelity calibration.

## Fix
Built `tools/self_diff.py` — unified snapshot (counts + hashes + metrics + belief status + lane health + EAD compliance) with session-to-session diff. Remaining: qualitative diffing needs git-log per file.

## Rule
Self-diff must cover both axes: count what changed AND hash whether content changed. Hash mismatches flag silent edits even when counts are stable (ISO-17).
