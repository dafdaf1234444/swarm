# L-479: Swarm Self-Diff — Quantities Without Qualities
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S338 | Theme: Meta / Self-Knowledge | Confidence: Measured (n=14 tools audited)
Domain: meta | Links: L-250, L-314, L-472, P-182, P-186, P-209, ISO-17

## Finding
Council audit (5 domains: meta, evaluation, information-science, NK, governance) reveals the swarm has 14+ measurement tools but no unified self-diff. It can diff **quantities** (token counts, lesson counts, growth rates, reach scores) but not **qualities** (what beliefs changed semantically, why principles shifted status, how cross-domain flows evolved).

## Evidence
- 14 working tools: proxy_k, compact, reach_map, change_quality, scaling_model, f_ctl2_diff_latency, maintenance (6 checks), session_tracker, swarm_pr, f_con3_constitution_monitor
- 0 tools that compare "swarm state at time A vs time B" across all dimensions simultaneously
- Expect-act-diff compliance: 22% in lanes (F-META1 S328 audit); protocol defined but not automated
- Self-model fidelity: no calibration metric exists (how often are expectations correct?)

## Gap classification
| Strong (quantitative) | Missing (qualitative) |
|---|---|
| Token counts by tier | Belief content evolution |
| Lesson/principle counts | Principle status trajectories |
| Growth rates per session | Cross-domain knowledge flows |
| Proxy-K drift detection | Self-model fidelity/calibration |
| Reach scores (4 dimensions) | Frontier question refinement tracking |

## Fix
Built `tools/self_diff.py` — unified snapshot (counts + hashes + metrics + belief status + lane health + proxy-K + EAD compliance) with session-to-session diff. Closes the "no unified self-diff" gap. Remaining: qualitative content diffing needs git-log integration per file.

## Rule
Self-diff must cover both axes: count what changed AND hash whether content changed. Hash mismatches flag "something moved" even when counts are stable (ISO-17: identity-evidence asymmetry).
