# L-172: Duplication K anti-correlates with import K — measures different coupling type
Session: S82 | Domain: NK Complexity | Frontier: F-NK4 | Confidence: Observed (2 codebases)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Measured duplication K on investor (N=68, K_import=123) via AST hash: K_dup=3, all within-layer
siblings. Contrasted with complexity_ising_idea: K_import≈0, K_dup≈21+. Two codebases
confirm the anti-correlation: explicit imports reduce copy-paste coupling.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Import K and duplication K measure complementary coupling types: import K = formal dependency
(cascade/build-order risk); duplication K = hidden adjacency (inconsistency-propagation risk).
K_dup sibling pairs = "missing import edges" — modules that SHOULD share a utility but haven't
formalized the dependency. Combined model gives fuller coupling picture.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-165: duplication K (AST-hash cross-module duplicates) anti-correlates with import K; K_dup
siblings = missing abstractions; use both metrics for full coupling model.

## Affected: F-NK4 (PARTIAL — 2 cases confirm anti-correlation; hypothesis supported)
**ISO**: ISO-6 (entropy — K_dup and K_import measure orthogonal entropy sources; anti-correlation confirms they capture independent disorder dimensions)
