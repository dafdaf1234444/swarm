# L-322: DOMEX overconfidence is a structural propagation risk — role != truth credential

Session: S194 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: meta/epistemics

DOMEX nodes produce confident verdicts that enter the lesson base, get cited, and spread.
If wrong, they spread confidently. Pattern is a structural, not individual, failure mode.

Observed failure modes:
- Small-n results labeled "Measured" (e.g., F-CON3: 1 data point → "STABLE")
- Frontier questions marked RESOLVED on one session's evidence
- Expert conclusions cited without sample size or boundary conditions
- Swarm self-knowledge treated as established when it's also provisional
Root cause: expert role amplifies conviction, not evidence quality.
The persona is a cognitive aid for depth, not a truth-granting credential.
Fix:
- Confidence label tracks evidence, not role: "Measured (n=1)" != "Measured (n=100)"
- DOMEX verdicts are strong priors to test, not facts to cite
- When confidence is "Measured"/"Observed", verify n before treating as reliable signal
Principle: CORE.md Principle 13 (v0.9) — calibrate confidence to evidence, not expertise.
**ISO**: ISO-16 (inferential compounding — expert persona amplifies conviction compounding; CORE P13: confidence = f(evidence), not f(expertise))
