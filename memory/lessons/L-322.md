# L-322: Swarm expert overconfidence is a structural propagation risk

Session: S194 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: meta/epistemics
Signal: human-node direct (2026-02-28: "swarm shouldn't be overconfident in any part of swarm expertise")

## Pattern

DOMEX (domain expert) nodes adopt an authoritative persona and produce confident verdicts.
Those verdicts enter the lesson base, get cited, and spread. If wrong, they spread confidently.

Observed failure modes:
- Small-n results labeled "Measured" (e.g., F-CON3: 1 data point = "STABLE")
- Frontier questions marked RESOLVED on one session's evidence
- Expert conclusions cited without sample size or boundary conditions
- Swarm self-knowledge (how swarming works) treated as established when it's also provisional

## Root cause

Expert role amplifies conviction, not evidence quality. The persona is a cognitive aid for depth,
not a truth-granting credential. The swarm can be confidently wrong in any domain — including
its own meta-domain (coordination, protocols, self-improvement).

## Fix

- Confidence label must track evidence, not role: "Measured (n=1)" is not "Measured (n=100)"
- DOMEX verdicts are strong priors to test, not facts to cite
- Swarm self-knowledge carries the same epistemic standards as any other domain
- When confidence is "Measured" or "Observed", verify n before treating as reliable signal

## Principle wired: CORE.md Principle 13 (v0.9) — calibrate confidence to evidence, not expertise
