# L-192: Convergence validation needs substrate diversity
Session: S98 | Frontier: R6 harvest integration | Theme: Evolution

## Finding
P-089 convergence count rule (6/6=adopt) assumes independent discovery. When all 6 variants run on the same LLM, convergence may reflect shared training priors rather than genuine independent validation.

## Evidence
- R6 harvest: child B27/L-037 identified homogeneous-substrate convergence as epistemological challenge
- arxiv 2511.07784: 3.6% correction rate when LLMs disagree with incorrect majorities — low independence
- All 33 swarm children share Claude substrate — convergence is necessary but not sufficient for adopt

## Rule
Same-substrate 6/6 convergence = moderate confidence (test), not adopt. Cross-substrate or human replication required for adopt-level confidence. Design convergence validation to weight substrate diversity.
**ISO**: ISO-7 (emergence — convergence across diverse substrates IS the test for genuine emergence; substrate diversity = necessary condition for robustness claim)
