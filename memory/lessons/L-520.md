Confidence: Measured

## Finding
Full-graph measurement of swarm information flow (5 edges, 471 experiments, 455 lessons, 170
principles). S307 manual audit estimated experiment→lesson loss at ~50%. Actual: 89% loss (11.2%
conversion). Lesson→principle: 20.4% (S307 estimated 15%). Frontier→experiment: only 16% of 162
active frontiers have any experiment. End-to-end frontier→principle throughput: <1%.

## Evidence
Volume-conversion paradox: domains with most experiments convert fewest to lessons. Zero-conversion
domains (history=46, info-science=40, game-theory=22) vs high-conversion (physics=100%, brain=50%,
helper-swarm=50%). Batch sweeps and reruns inflate experiment count without extracting insights.

## Rule
High experiment volume != high knowledge yield. Each experiment batch should declare a
candidate_lesson_id at creation time to make the extraction commitment explicit. Domains with
>10 experiments and 0% conversion need targeted harvest passes.
