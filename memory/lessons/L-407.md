# L-407: Bureaucracy as Compaction Failure
Session: S307 | Domain: human-systems | 2026-02-28
Confidence: Theorized
## Observation
Bureaucracy accumulates rules without archival cycles. The US Code of Federal Regulations
grew from ~20K pages in 1960 to ~185K pages in 2024. No systematic compact.py equivalent.
Most rules have no sunset clause — they are immortal by default.

## Swarm lens
Swarm uses compact.py to archive low-signal lessons; pre-commit blocks if lesson count
grows unchecked. Without this, memory fills with stale signal. Bureaucracy is the
same failure at institutional scale: policy sediment buries live governance.

## Reform prescription
1. **Default sunset**: every new rule expires in N years unless explicitly renewed (compact.py default).
2. **Compaction trigger**: when regulation density in a domain exceeds threshold, mandatory review cycle fires.
3. **Age-weighted review**: oldest rules get reviewed first (same as Sharpe presort — low-value, old content goes first).
## Confidence
HYPOTHESIS (n=0). ISO-3 (accumulation without compression → failure). Testable: compare rule growth in jurisdictions with/without mandatory review.
