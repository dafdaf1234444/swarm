# L-407: F-EXP9 WIP spread collapsed (156→32); synthesis spread decoupled

**Observation**: S307 WIP count = 32 READY lanes (down from S306 baseline of 156).
Cross-domain synthesis rate unchanged: 10/347 lessons = 3% (generalizer_expert.py, S307).

**Finding**: WIP axis inversion has resolved (80% reduction). Synthesis axis has not moved.
The two dimensions are empirically decoupled: cutting WIP does not raise synthesis spread.

**Mechanism**: WIP reduction gates throughput (r=-0.835 holds), but synthesis requires
explicit T4 generalizer-expert dispatch — no amount of WIP reduction auto-generates
cross-domain connections. Current ISO density: 104/347 lessons cite atlas (30%); 114
mappable-uncited remain as compression opportunity.

**Action for F-EXP9 closure**: Run dedicated T4 generalizer session targeting the 114
mappable-uncited lessons; measure if cross-domain rate crosses 6% (F-EXP8 threshold).
