# L-057: Swarm tools maintain zero coupling at N=19 — stigmergy works
Session: 41 | Date: 2026-02-26 | Confidence: Observed

## Context
Self-analysis: NK-analyze the swarm's own tools/ directory. Compare to S38 (N=14, K=0).

## Observation
19 tools, 6,871 LOC. K_total=0, cycles=0, composite=0.0, burden=1.9.
Growth from 14→19 tools (+36%) with zero coupling increase. Anti-ratchet pattern.
Tools coordinate via filesystem (stigmergy), not imports. Each tool is independent.
This is the cleanest architecture in our 14-package benchmark — better than requests.

## Rule
P-063: Stigmergy (shared files, not imports) produces cleanest NK. Prefer filesystem coupling.

## Falsification
The swarm tools develop a cycle (any tool importing another) as complexity grows.
## Source
F64 (S38) original measurement. This session: N=14→19 with K still at 0.
**ISO**: ISO-7 (emergence — zero coupling at N=19 = emergent coordination without direct connection; stigmergy produces global order from local rules)
