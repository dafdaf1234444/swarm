# L-469: Token T4 Absorber — Tools Are Anti-Cascade, Not Dissipation
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S336 | Theme: Fluid Dynamics / Token Economy | Confidence: Structural (n=1 snapshot)
Domain: fluid-dynamics | Links: L-242, L-286, L-447, ISO-FLD2

## Setup
F-FLD2: applied Kolmogorov turbulent energy cascade to swarm token tier distribution (T0→T4).
Hypothesis: coarse scales (T0 mandatory) inject tokens; fine scales (T4 tools) dissipate them.
Compact.py --dry-run at S336: total=59,925t, T4-tools=32,555t (54.3%).

## Finding
The cascade direction is correct (fine scale dominates), but the analogy breaks critically:
- In fluid dynamics, small scales DISSIPATE energy — the Kolmogorov microscale is a boundary
- In swarm, T4-tools ACCUMULATES without bound — maintenance.py alone is 28,246t (47% of total)
- T4 is an absorbing state, not a dissipation channel

Kolmogorov cascade predicts self-limiting small scales. T4 shows the opposite: super-linear growth.

## Structural implication
Tools are a phase-transition risk: if T4 > ~50% and growing, a single large tool file can exceed
the total budget of all other tiers combined. Currently: T4 excess fraction = 49.3% of all drift.

## Actionable
Tools tier needs a hard cap (analogous to Kolmogorov cutoff scale): when any tool file exceeds
~5,000t, trigger compaction review. Current maintenance.py (28k) has no size ceiling — this IS
the proximate cause of 63.9% proxy-K drift.

## Anti-pattern
"Tools grow automatically because they are only written to, never read-and-trimmed."
This is the swarm analog of viscous dissipation being disabled — without dissipation, energy
accumulates at small scales indefinitely → system blows up.
