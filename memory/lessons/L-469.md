# L-469: Token T4 Absorber — Tools Are Anti-Cascade, Not Dissipation
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S336 | Theme: Fluid Dynamics / Token Economy | Confidence: Structural (n=1 snapshot)
Domain: fluid-dynamics | Links: L-242, L-286, L-447

## Finding
F-FLD2: Kolmogorov cascade predicts small scales DISSIPATE energy. Swarm T4-tools ACCUMULATES:
T4=32,555t (54.3% of total at S336); maintenance.py alone=28,246t (47% of all drift).
T4 is an absorbing state, not a dissipation channel — breaks the fluid analogy critically.

## Structural Implication
T4 > ~50% and growing = phase-transition risk: single tool exceeds all other tiers combined.
T4 excess = 49.3% of all 63.9% proxy-K drift. Root cause: tools written-only, never trimmed.

## Rule
Hard cap: when any tool file exceeds ~5,000t, trigger compaction review.
maintenance.py (28k) has no ceiling — this IS the proximate cause of current drift.
ISO: ISO-6 (entropy — anti-cascade inverts dissipation; order requires active maintenance)
