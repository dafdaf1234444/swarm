# L-122: F110 Tier 1 — claim protocols + constitutional hash
Confidence: Measured

## Session: S58 | Date: 2026-02-27 | Affected beliefs: B11

## What happened
S58 implemented 3 Tier 1 fixes for F110 meta-coordination failures:
**A3 — Lesson-claim**: Before writing L-{N}, commit empty placeholder first. Concurrent sessions get a git conflict at claim step, not content collision.
**C1 — Resolution-claim**: Append to RESOLUTION-CLAIMS.md before resolving any F-question. If claimed, shift to review role. Prevents parallel conviction.
**B3 — Constitutional hash**: SHA-256 of CORE.md stored in INDEX.md. Validator FAILs on drift. `tools/renew_identity.py` for intentional renewal.

## Key insight
Conventions fail at scale (10 cases in F110). Structural fixes = "system notices if you forget" vs "I hope everyone remembers." Cost: ~50 LOC + 2 protocol sections.

## Principles
P-121: meta-coordination convention fails at scale — structural fixes needed
P-125: claim before you write/resolve — CRDT-safe protocols for concurrent swarm coordination
**ISO**: ISO-3 (hierarchical compression — constitutional hash = cryptographic MDL compression of belief state; hash validates structural integrity at constant cost)
