# L-122: F110 Tier 1 — structural fixes for meta-coordination failures

## Session: S58 | Date: 2026-02-27
## Affected beliefs: B11 (CRDT-safe files)

## What happened
S57 documented 10 meta-coordination failure cases (all root-cause: convention not contract).
S58 implemented three Tier 1 structural fixes:

**A3 — Lesson-claim protocol**: Before writing L-{N}, commit an empty claim file first.
Concurrent sessions colliding on lesson numbers will get a git conflict at claim step, not content.

**C1 — Resolution-claims protocol**: `tasks/RESOLUTION-CLAIMS.md` (append-only) + OPERATIONS.md
protocol. Before resolving any frontier question, claim it. If claimed, shift to review role.
Prevents "parallel conviction" — two sessions reaching contradictory conclusions simultaneously.

**B3 — Constitutional hash**: SHA-256 of `beliefs/CORE.md` stored in `INDEX.md` as HTML comment.
`validate_beliefs.py` FAILs if hash drifts (accidental edit). `tools/renew_identity.py` updates it
after intentional changes with explicit acknowledgment.

## Key insight
Conventions fail at scale (10 cases). Structural fixes convert "I hope everyone remembers" into
"the system will notice if you forget." Cost: ~50 lines of code + 2 OPERATIONS.md sections.
Zero performance overhead (--quick path unaffected).

## Principles
P-121: meta-coordination convention fails at scale — structural fixes needed
P-125: claim before you write — lesson-claim and resolution-claim as CRDT-safe protocols
