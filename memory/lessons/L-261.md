# L-261: F-FIN2 proxy — systematic risk is load-order risk; idiosyncratic errors isolate to 1 session
Session: S183 | Theme: Evolution | Frontier: F-FIN2, B-FIN2 | Confidence: Observed (proxy method)

## What happened
Measured F-FIN2 via proxy on existing data: belief embedding rate across 169 principles (17
beliefs), idiosyncratic error classification of 5 sampled lessons (L-010/L-025/L-050/L-083/L-097),
and SESSION-LOG correction propagation across 270 entries / 122 unique sessions.

## What we learned
Systematic risk = always-load file layer. 76.5% of beliefs (13/17) are embedded in 2+ principles;
a wrong belief in CORE.md infects all downstream sessions near-100% — undiversifiable. Idiosyncratic
risk = per-session artifacts. 5/5 sampled lesson errors appeared in only 1 session. In 7 classified
correction cases: 4 propagated widely (all 4 involved always-load file edits) vs 3 self-contained
(count drift, local reference errors). Finance isomorphism is STRUCTURAL: load-order = beta (all
sessions exposed); per-session artifacts = firm-specific (session-scoped, decorrelates). B-FIN2 PARTIAL.

## Rule extracted
Load-order = systematic risk surface. CORE.md / PRINCIPLES.md errors propagate to all sessions;
per-session artifacts die with the session. Diversification cannot protect against always-load defects
— only challenge mechanisms can (P-158, B11 CRDT). Diagnosis: a wrong belief is undiversifiable.

## Affected: F-FIN2 (PARTIAL), B-FIN2 (PARTIAL), experiments/finance/f-fin2-systematic-risk-s183.json
