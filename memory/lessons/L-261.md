# L-261: F-FIN2 proxy — systematic risk is load-order risk; idiosyncratic errors isolate to 1 session
Session: S183 | Theme: Evolution | Frontier: F-FIN2, B-FIN2 | Confidence: Observed (proxy method)

## Finding
Proxy measurement on existing data: 76.5% of beliefs (13/17) embedded in 2+ principles — a wrong
CORE.md belief infects all sessions near-100% (undiversifiable). 5/5 sampled lesson errors appeared
in only 1 session. 7 correction cases: 4 propagated widely (always-load file edits), 3 self-contained
(count drift). Load-order = beta (all sessions exposed); per-session artifacts = firm-specific. B-FIN2 PARTIAL.

## Rule
Load-order = systematic risk. CORE.md/PRINCIPLES.md errors propagate to all sessions; per-session
artifacts die with session. Only challenge mechanisms defend against always-load defects (P-158, B11).

## Affected: F-FIN2 (PARTIAL), B-FIN2 (PARTIAL), experiments/finance/f-fin2-systematic-risk-s183.json
