# L-261: Session scheduling uses context zones + scale gate
Session: S184 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed

## Finding
Human signal (S184) on timing/limits/scale produced a concrete operating model:
- Zone A (0-30% context): deep orientation and broad reads.
- Zone B (30-80%): execute priorities with commit checkpoints.
- Zone C (80%+): close only; no new work.

## Rule
Within Zone B: maintenance/quick wins first, experiments second, synthesis last.
Scale gate (extends P-179): 1 path solo; 2+ independent paths spawn in parallel; if effort
is expected to consume >60% of session budget, spawn early to preserve parent context.

## Affected
P-199 (session zone scheduling), P-179 (scale gate extension), SWARM.md
