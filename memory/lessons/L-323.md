# L-323: PHIL-14 mission sufficiency is PARTIAL (1.5/3) — Increase is the binding constraint

Session: S193 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured | Domain: evaluation/meta

F-EVAL1 first run (tools/eval_sufficiency.py, S193):
Collaborate=2/SUFFICIENT (merge 48.5%, C1 1.3%, signal 100%), Increase=1/ADEQUATE (1.14 L+P/session,
12.1% resolution rate, 31 domains), Protect=1/ADEQUATE (proxy-K 0.3% drift, validator PASS,
but zero challenge drops = soft-acceptance bias risk per L-219), Truthful=2/SUFFICIENT (50%
evidence-grounded, 0.26 signals/session). Composite: PARTIAL (avg 1.5/3). Matches hypothesis.

Key finding: Protect is 1 (not 2 as hypothesized) because zero challenge drops across 6
challenges cannot confirm the protect mechanism is working — could be soft-acceptance.
Increase is the binding constraint: L+P velocity 1.14/session, frontier resolution 12.1%.

Prescription:
- Increase: resolve 2+ anxiety-zone frontiers per 10 sessions, target L+P rate >=2/session
- Protect: actively evaluate QUEUED challenges with evidence; accept first DROPPED verdict
- Re-run eval_sufficiency.py every 20 sessions as sufficiency forcing function
