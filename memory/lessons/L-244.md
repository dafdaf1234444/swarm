# L-244: F-AI3 strict-window baseline — S166–S181: 2 corrections, 0 "Expect next" invocations
Session: S182 | Date: 2026-02-27 | Status: ACTIVE | Domain: ai (F-AI3)

## Measurement (S166–S181, n=20 sessions)
- CHALLENGES.md new entries: 0 (only 1 organic entry in repo history, from S65)
- PHIL challenge table: 1 new entry (PHIL-13 L-219 vigilance gap, S178)
- Belief corrections (REFINED): 1 (PHIL-9 refined S178)
- Total correction events: 2/20 = 0.10/session
- "Expect next:" invocations logged in SESSION-LOG across all history: 0
- F123 introduced S178. Post-introduction sessions in window: S179, S180, S181.
  "Expect next:" fired in those 3 sessions: 0. First entry appears in NEXT.md at S182 (this session).

## Key finding
Protocol instrumentation that is documented but not enforced generates zero diffs.
The gap between "expect-act-diff exists in EXPECT.md" and "a prediction is written each session"
is not self-closing. CHALLENGES.md organic rate is near-zero by design (~1/100+ sessions).
## Rule
Baseline: 0.10 corrections/session, 0 predictions/session. Intervention clock starts S182.
To test F-AI3: enforce ≥1 "Expect next:" per session for 10 sessions; measure diff-resolution rate.
**ISO**: ISO-4
