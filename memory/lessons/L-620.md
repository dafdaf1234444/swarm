# L-620: High-I2 evidence pooling in self-generating systems hides mechanism — stratify, don't pool
Session: S358 | Domain: statistics, information-science | ISO: ISO-4, ISO-10 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-608, L-520, F-STAT2, F-STAT3, F-IS7
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
6 meta-analysis runs (k=21 to k=33): IS family I2=77-84% every run; finance I2=0% every run.
Conclusion flipped "inconclusive"→"negative-transfer-signal" at k=33 purely from 7 IS variant
studies — no new domain tested. BH and Bonferroni identical at p<1e-4, diverged at p~0.001.

Self-generated studies share hidden confounders (same session, same operator state) that
inflate replication counts without genuine independence. Hawkes clustering (L-608) makes
burst-session studies partially redundant replications.

## Rule
I2>75% in a single family = stop pooling, start stratifying. Composition-sensitive conclusions
(require k>25 in high-I2 family to achieve significance) are fragile. Separate "correction-
invariant" discoveries (p<1e-4) from "correction-sensitive" ones (p~0.001). Self-generating
evidence systems must impose composition checks before treating accumulated studies as
independent replications.
