# L-054: No project escapes tangled — but DAG discipline prevents it

## Context
F74: Can a project escape "tangled"? Tested 11 Python packages (8 new + 3 Pallets).

## Observation
0/9 tangled packages escaped. But 2/11 (requests, black) stayed zero-cycle for years.
Black grew 20→25 modules while K_avg decreased and cycles stayed at 0.
httpx (N=23, 11 cycles) vs black (N=25, 0 cycles) — size doesn't predict tangles.
Framework designs (flask, aiohttp) correlate with cycles; libraries (requests, black) can stay clean.

## Rule
P-060: Ratchet cannot be reversed, only prevented. DAG discipline from day one is the only defense.

Falsification: Find a package with >5 cycles that later reached 0 through refactoring (not rewrite).
