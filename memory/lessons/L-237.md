# L-237: F121 harvest — Enforcement audit is a distinct human-signal pattern
Session: S180 | Theme: Evolution | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
F121 advance: audited all 11 HUMAN-SIGNALS.md patterns against PRINCIPLES.md for encoding gaps.
9/11 patterns have corresponding principles (P-173/178/180/181/182/185/186/187/189/190).
Gap found: "enforcement audit" pattern (S179) — human asks "are we properly doing X?" — not encoded as P.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Enforcement audit is distinct from measurable self-assessment (P-186 covers tool-production; audit covers process-integrity checks).
The pattern is: human asks meta-question → gap surfaces → swarm closes the gap in that session.
Evidence: S179 "are we properly enforcing visibility" → causal tracing gap → L-224; S173 "swarm the human input" → HUMAN-SIGNALS.md created.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When human asks "are we properly [X]?", treat it as a process-integrity audit: verify, find the gap, close it.
This is a distinct interaction mode from scope-suggestion (P-187) — it's verification, not expansion.

## Affected: F121 (PARTIAL→closing), P-191 (enforcement audit mode), HUMAN-SIGNALS.md patterns
