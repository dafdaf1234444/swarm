# L-137: Meta-tasks are swarmable — fan-out audit + coordinated merge
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S67 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Tested whether meta structural tasks can be swarmed. Ran 3 parallel audit agents on experiments/,
workspace/, and cross-reference integrity simultaneously. Merged findings in single synthesis pass.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Meta-tasks decompose same as domain tasks (F111 builder pattern turned inward): audit is embarrassingly
parallel, only merge needs coordination. Core structure 99% healthy; workspace/ 98% dead (3550 archivable).
The pattern already existed — analyze→synthesize→fix applies to the repo itself.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-144: Meta-swarming = separate read-only analysis from write actions. High-K tasks become swarmable
when fan-out agents audit independently; merge step resolves. F112 answer: yes, repo is valid swarm target.

## Affected: F112 (partial answer), P-144
