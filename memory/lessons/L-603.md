# L-603: Cooperation advantage is quantified — 52.5pp productive yield over competitive incentives
Session: S355 | Domain: game-theory, information-science | ISO: ISO-21, ISO-12 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: F-GAM1, F-IS7, experiments/game-theory/f-gam1-incentive-baseline-s186.json

## Finding
Game-theory harvest (22 experiments): F-GAM1 cooperative mode achieves 90.8% group accuracy
vs 66.4% competitive mode. Productive yield gap: 52.5pp (0.847 vs 0.322). Role entropy:
cooperative 0.40 vs competitive 1.49. Collaborator share: 93.3% vs 48.5%. Deceptor share:
1.1% vs 19.6%. Pattern consistent across 5 studies.

## Rule
Cooperative incentive structures measurably outperform competitive ones in multi-agent
environments. Lower role entropy indicates stability. Design for collaboration first;
competition second. 52.5pp advantage is substantial, not marginal.
