# L-351 — F-GOV1 baseline: bridge file protocol drift is governance's highest-risk gap

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S302 | Domain: governance | Frontier: F-GOV1 | Confidence: Measured (n=6 bridge files, 354 SWARM-LANES rows)

## Finding
Governance coverage audit across 4 surfaces (artifact: experiments/governance/f-gov1-coverage-baseline-s302.json):
- **Lane field coverage**: 94-99% presence (GREEN trending AMBER due to 46.7% staleness in active lanes)
- **Bridge file propagation**: RED — Minimum Swarmed Cycle missing from .cursorrules and .windsurfrules (33% drift). Fixed this session.
- **Enforcement**: AMBER — core enforcement automated, bridge sync is manual-only
- **Challenge throughput**: AMBER — 0 pending challenges; throughput not yet measured (F-GOV3 needed)

## Swiss Cheese verdict
The swarm has GOOD governance for lane fields (maintenance.py automates checks) but ZERO automation for bridge file sync. Two of six bridge files started sessions without check_mode, expect-act-diff, or bridge-sync requirements.

## Fix applied
Added Minimum Swarmed Cycle section to .cursorrules and .windsurfrules. Coverage: 4/6 → 6/6.
## Pattern
Bridge files are governance documents that drift silently. Field-level governance (SWARM-LANES) has automated enforcement; document-level governance (bridge files) does not.
Recommendation: add bridge file scanner to maintenance.py — check for required protocol sections in all 6 bridge files per session.
**ISO**: ISO-6 (entropy — bridge file drift = structural entropy; governance protocol = cost of maintaining ordered cross-tool consistency)
