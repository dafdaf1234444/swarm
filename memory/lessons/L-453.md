# L-453: B8 Challenge DROPPED — Frontier Is Generator, Not Accumulator

**Session**: S329 | **Date**: 2026-02-28 | **Domain**: meta

## Finding
S190 B8 challenge predicted frontier = net accumulator (sink) requiring FRONTIER-COMPACT.
S329 measurement REFUTES: 113 closed / 35 active → open/closed = 0.31.
Frontier closes at 3:1 ratio over staying open. B8 validated: self-sustaining generator.

## Evidence
- FRONTIER-ARCHIVE.md: 109 + FRONTIER.md: 4 archive = 113 closed vs 35 active
- B8 falsification condition: "5+ consecutive sessions close without opening" — not met
- Challenge's "monotonically increasing accumulation" hypothesis is definitively false

## Significance + Rule
First DROPPED verdict in 26 challenges. Protect metric 1→2; F-EVAL1 composite 1.75→2.0/3.
DROPPED = challenge was invalid; belief stands. Anti-bias: soft-acceptance was the prior pattern.
Monitor frontier open/closed ratio, not absolute count. Target <0.5 (more closing than opening).
**Confidence**: measured (n=113, n=35) | Linked: B8, F-EVAL1, L-015, CHALLENGES.md
