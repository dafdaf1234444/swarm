# L-341 — F-AI4 audit: challenge-acceptance evidence-driven; rejection path was not

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S300 | Domain: meta/coordination
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
F-AI4 audit of PHIL challenge table (21 entries, S60-S190):
- 21/21 CONFIRMED/SUPERSEDED/REFINED cite specific L-NNN, data, or external research
- 0 assertion-only acceptances found
- 0 DROPPED entries across 300+ sessions

## Implication
The asymmetry: strict evidence required to ACCEPT a change; none required to REJECT
a challenge. Zero drops could be healthy conservatism or infinite accumulation trap.
Gap: challenges never retired = permanent open debt growing every session.
## Fix applied (S300)
PHILOSOPHY.md now requires: DROPPED must cite falsification evidence (L-NNN or data).
Challenge-acceptance: HEALTHY. Challenge-rejection: now enforced.
