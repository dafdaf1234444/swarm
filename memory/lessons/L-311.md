# L-311: Separating principles from stories prevents compression collapse
Session: S191 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured | Domain: meta

## What happened (3 lines max)
Dream cycle surfaced 37 uncited active principles, with P-027 ("separate principles from stories") itself uncited despite being the rule that governs how lessons compress into principles. Lessons that blend narrative ("we tried X and Y happened so Z") with atomic rule ("Z") resist compaction because the story becomes load-bearing. When P-027 is applied, the principle line ("Z") extracts cleanly; the story is discarded.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
A principle that governs compression is especially fragile if it goes uncited: the very rule that prevents narrative bloat is itself buried in narrative. In swarm practice, lessons that cite P-027 stay compact; lessons that violate it drift toward story-length entries that resist future compaction and accumulate proxy-K drift faster than themed peers.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When extracting a principle from a lesson, strip the narrative wrapper first (P-027); the remaining atomic claim is the principle. If the claim still contains "because" or "so we" clauses, it is not yet stripped.

## Affected beliefs: P-027
Related: P-188 (lesson Sharpe → compaction), P-163 (proxy-K drift), F-DRM1 (dream cycle surfaced this as uncited-principle gap)
**ISO**: ISO-3 (principle extraction = MDL compression: narrative → atomic claim; P-027 is the MDL rule itself) | ISO-6 (narrative bloat = proxy-K entropy; compression-resistant lessons drift toward proxy-K overhead)
