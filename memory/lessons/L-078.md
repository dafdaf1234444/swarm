# L-078: Late bloomers can leapfrog — no-modes recovered from last to #5
**Date**: 2026-02-26 | **Session**: 44 | **Confidence**: medium

## Context
no-modes was the worst variant (132, rank #13) through session 42. By session 44 it jumped to 273 (rank #5), gaining +141 in 2 sessions — the largest single-round gain of any variant.

## Lesson
Variants that appear to underperform may have slow bootstraps followed by rapid catch-up. no-modes lacked structure at genesis (directionless per L-032) but eventually self-organized session modes and added principles. Early ranking is not predictive of final ranking beyond ~session 5.

## Implications
- Don't prune "losing" variants too early — give at least 4-5 sessions
- The no-modes recovery suggests that structure emerges naturally; imposed structure just accelerates it
- P-084: early variant rankings are unreliable — allow 4+ sessions before pruning
