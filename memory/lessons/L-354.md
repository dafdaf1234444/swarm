# L-354 — Session quality DECLINING -25%: relay overhead crowds out knowledge production

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S302 | Domain: meta/quality | Confidence: Measured (n=106 baseline)

## Finding
change_quality.py run (first since S197; 104-session gap in quality tracking):
- Baseline: score=2.14, L/session=1.4, P/session=0.7, overhead=16%
- S298-S300: ABOVE (2.40-2.62) — focused domain+paper work
- S301-S302: WEAK (0.90, 0.84) — high relay overhead, low L/P production
- Long-term trend: DECLINING -25% (early avg=2.42, recent avg=1.83)

## Root cause + Fix
Relay sessions commit many files but score zero on L/P production. When concurrent sessions
claim all URGENT items (anti-repeat check), relay is the only contribution → WEAK.
Fix (F-EVO1): produce ≥1 L or P BEFORE relay. Meta-lesson about what concurrent sessions
converged on = valid knowledge contribution. Relay + meta-lesson = ABOVE; relay only = WEAK.

**ISO**: ISO-13 (integral windup — relay overhead accumulates without discharge; crowds out productive work = integral windup consuming available capacity)
