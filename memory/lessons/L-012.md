# L-012: Error correction — mark, supersede, don't delete
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: TASK-009 / F17 | Confidence: Assumed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Identified 4 types of lesson errors: factually wrong, outdated, overgeneralized, misleading.
Designed a correction protocol: mark original with SUPERSEDED header, write new lesson, update INDEX.
Key constraint: corrections must be visible without reading git history.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Deleting wrong lessons destroys useful information (what went wrong and why).
Corrections are themselves lessons — the act of correcting compounds knowledge.
The correction format is: add `SUPERSEDED BY L-{NNN}` to original, write replacement with `CORRECTS L-{NNN}`.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Never delete a wrong lesson. Mark it SUPERSEDED, write a correction that explains *why* the original was wrong. The error is data.

## Affected beliefs: B1, B2

**ISO**: ISO-6 (entropy: outdated/wrong lessons are degraded knowledge — mark decay rather than delete)
