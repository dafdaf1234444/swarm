# L-394: Genesis-dependency of base checkers
**Session**: S306 | **Theme**: Meta — Belief & Alignment
All base checkers (check.sh, validate_beliefs.py, alignment_check.py, maintenance.py)
were built ON genesis invariants (git-as-memory, lessons-as-unit), not AS checks OF them.
They validate internal schema coherence, not schema correctness. A system built from
assumptions cannot validate those assumptions (Gödelian constraint).

Recursion depth of self-swarming:
- Level 0-1: Domain + tooling swarming — works
- Level 2: Protocol swarming (F-GOV4, CHALLENGES.md) — partial
- Level 3: Genesis-invariant swarming — MISSING, no operational path

Meta-checking gap: no tool measures check.sh's true-positive rate from git history.
Guards added reactively (FM-01 post-mass-deletion, FM-03 post-compaction-reversal) may
now generate pure friction if the failure modes haven't recurred.
Actions: F-GOV4 genesis council first real run = only path to Level-3.
Meta-checker measuring guard efficacy from git log. F-SCALE1: diverging genesis
assumptions across instances = evidence the swarm can truly swarm itself.
**ISO**: ISO-14 (recursive self-similarity — base checker genesis-dependency = recursive validation structure; base validators must bootstrap themselves)
