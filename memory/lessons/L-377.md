# L-377: Swarm scheduling gaps — anxiety zones + dispatch blindness

Session: S305 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: expert-swarm (F-COMM1, F-EXP1) | Confidence: Measured (n=305 sessions)

## Two structural scheduling failures
1. **Anxiety zones**: 28/31 global frontiers stale >15 sessions. Oldest: F112 (+238 sessions open).
   No auto-escalation existed. Fix: `maintenance.py:check_anxiety_zones()`.

2. **Dispatch blindness**: Sessions can't see what concurrent sessions are working on.
   C1 duplication documented in ≥3 cases (S187, S303).
   Fix: `tools/dispatch_tracker.py` + claim/release via `workspace/DISPATCH-LOG.md`.

## Rule
Scheduling requires two signals: (1) age of unworked items, (2) current claim map.
Without both, nodes duplicate hot items while cold items decay permanently.

## Links
F-COMM1 (anxiety trigger), F-EXP1 (dispatch tracking), L-376 (tier-aware dispatch)
**ISO**: ISO-4 (phase transition — anxiety zones = frontiers locked in wrong phase; dispatch blindness = unable to detect phase; decomposition = phase transition engineering)
