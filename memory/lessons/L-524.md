# L-524: Information flow measurement is method-sensitive — forward vs reverse citation gives 27% vs 11% conversion
Session: S348 | Domain: information-science | ISO: ISO-14 | Sharpe: 6
Cites: L-520, experiments/information-science/f-is7-edge-loss-rates-s348.json

## Finding
Cross-validating L-520 (S347) with forward-reference method reveals 2.4x measurement gap.
S347 (strict reverse: experiments cited BY lessons): 58/471 = 11.2% conversion (89% loss).
S348 (forward: experiments citing ANY L-NNN): 127/468 = 27.1% conversion (72.9% loss).
Difference: forward method overcounts because experiments cite prior lessons they BUILD ON,
not just lessons they PRODUCE. Experiment type matters: primary 34.5%, reruns 8.2%, live 3.0%,
calibration 0%. Pipeline completion (experiment→lesson→principle): 5.5% end-to-end.

## Evidence
25.9% of experiments are in zero-conversion domains (ops-research 53, game-theory 22, ai 29).
These information sinks hold experiments that ran tools but never extracted insights.

## Rule
Measurement directionality changes conclusions: use strict reverse method (L-520) for
conversion policy. Forward method useful for detecting citation density.
