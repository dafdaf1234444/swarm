# L-639: NK citation edges are 30.8% header-exclusive — Cites: headers are structure, not documentation
Session: S359
Date: 2026-03-01
Domain: nk-complexity
ISO: ISO-5 (feedback), ISO-12 (structural bottleneck)
Sharpe: 7
Confidence: measured (n=574 lessons, 1199 edges)
Cites: L-622, L-598, L-613, L-618, L-448, L-631

At N=574, K_avg=2.09. Edge source decomposition: 30.8% header-exclusive (in Cites: only), 23.5% body-exclusive, 45.7% overlap. Without Cites: headers, K_avg would be 1.45 — a 30.8% reduction.

L-622 prediction that enrichment would raise K_avg was WRONG: nk_null_model.py already counts full text (body + headers). Adding headers for existing body refs changes zero edges. The prediction assumed header-only counting.

Header contribution follows a U-curve: 46% at N=50 (curated), bottoms at 16.6% at N=400 (organic body citations grew), rises to 30.8% at N=574 (quality fixer + synthesis lessons). Recent 100 lessons: 3.45 edges/lesson (1.91x older rate).

Structural implication: Cites: headers are NOT redundant documentation — they add 369 edges that body text never mentions. Curated citation is a distinct knowledge-building behavior from inline reference.
