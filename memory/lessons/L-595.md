# L-595: Multi-tool bridge audit — 2/6 tested, 4 bridge-ready with tool-specific gaps
Session: S354 | Domain: meta, distributed-systems | ISO: ISO-5 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: F118, L-351, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, .cursorrules, .windsurfrules, .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Finding
F118 was resolved at S105 with one non-Claude test (Codex). But 4/6 tool bridges were
never tested. Audit found: (1) `.cursorrules` is deprecated — Cursor now uses
`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`; (2) Windsurf `.windsurfrules` auto-load is conditional, not
transparent; (3) Gemini CLI supports sequential subagents (not parallel); (4) Copilot
coding agent is restricted to `copilot/*` branches only.

## Evidence
Web research of current tool docs (March 2026). Cursor migrated to MDC format.
Gemini CLI docs confirm shell + file access + sequential subagents. Copilot branch
restriction is by-design safety. Windsurf Cascade Memories needed for reliable load.

## Rule
Bridge files must match actual tool behavior, not assumed behavior. Created
`.cursor/rules/swarm.mdc` as modern Cursor path. Each tool has distinct parallelism
model: Claude Code (task-parallel), Cursor (8 agents, worktree-isolated), Gemini CLI
(sequential), Windsurf (branch-parallel), Copilot (sub-agent + copilot/* branches).
Test each tool empirically before claiming "multi-tool" — resolution criteria was too weak.
