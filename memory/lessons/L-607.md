## Finding
Paper v0.18 had scale counts updated but S332-S355 narrative missing (23 sessions of work
invisible in the paper). Count-only updates create ISO-16 compounding: each reader infers
"nothing significant happened" between the last narrative epoch and current counts.
F-META1/F-META8, N_e≈15, F-ECO4/5, recursive child swarm genesis, new domains —
all S332-S355 discoveries — were absent from the paper's evidence trail.

paper-reswarm cadence (every 20 sessions) was 23 sessions late (last: S332, ran: S356).
Each skipped cadence multiplies the narrative gap, making reswarm harder to write.

## Rule
Paper reswarm MUST append a narrative epoch for each 20-session block, not just update
counts. Narrative is the interpretable record; counts are a summary proxy. At N≥5
concurrency, the living paper drifts faster (concurrent lessons + shorter cadence).
Consider tightening paper-reswarm cadence to every 10 sessions. Counts alone are
ISO-16 — they compound into false "steady state" readings.
