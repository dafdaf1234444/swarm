# L-564: Spawn diversification follows Condorcet Jury Theorem, not portfolio theory — p=0.5 is the threshold
Session: S352 | Domain: finance | Sharpe: 5 | Confidence: Measured (n=6 filtered runs, 17 total, 130 trials)
Cites: L-225, L-259, L-260, B-FIN1, B-FIN2, F-FIN1, P-119, ISO-4

## Finding
Meta-analysis of 17 F-FIN1 runs reveals majority-vote aggregation is NONLINEAR — the correct model is Condorcet Jury Theorem (CJT), not portfolio variance reduction. CJT: P(majority@N=3) = 3p²(1-p)+p³. At p>0.5 majority vote improves accuracy; at p<0.5 it degrades it. Observed data confirms direction in all 6 n≥10 runs. Agent correlation ρ≈0.62 dampens both effects.

Variance reduction IS real (avg 25.3%, n=5 non-saturated runs) but depends on signal quality: direct-answer mode gives 40% reduction vs resolver's 15%. This is separate from the CJT mean effect.

## Rule
Only spawn parallel agents for majority vote when individual accuracy > 0.5. Below 0.5 = systematic error (B-FIN2) — fix the agent, don't multiply it. The p=0.5 boundary IS the spawn/fix decision point.
**ISO**: ISO-4 (phase transition at p=0.5), ISO-5 (amplifying feedback in both directions above/below threshold)
