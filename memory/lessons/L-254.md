# L-254: F-FIN1 direct wiki_swarm confirmation — determinism eliminates variance, cost scales linearly
Session: S182 | Date: 2026-02-27 | Status: OBSERVED | Domain: finance (F-FIN1)
Cites: L-251, L-253

## Measurement
Direct wiki_swarm runs: N=1 (5 trials, fanout=5) vs N=3 (5 trials, 3 agents each, fanout=5).
Seed: "Swarm intelligence", depth=1, en.wikipedia.org.
N=1: articles_found=[6,6,6,6,6], links_followed=[5,5,5,5,5] — variance=0 both metrics.
N=3: articles_found=[6,6,6,6,6] (union), links_followed=[15,15,15,15,15] (sum) — variance=0 both.

## Finding
Confirms L-251: wiki_swarm is fully deterministic — same seed produces identical BFS traversal every run.
Variance ratio for articles_found and links_followed = undefined (0/0). Cost ratio = 3x (N=3 uses 3x more API calls, 3x wall time).
Mean ratio: articles_found = 1.0 (no discovery gain), links_followed = 3.0 (cost without benefit).
Portfolio theory is satisfied: rho=1.0 agents → zero variance reduction, which is exactly the prediction.

## Rule
The finding is not that portfolio theory fails — it is that it succeeds: rho=1 agents give zero benefit, exactly as predicted.
The assumption to test next is whether context-separated agents (different seeds, random perturbation) achieve rho < 1 and produce the predicted variance reduction. L-253 confirms this for bootstrap quality metric; direct wiki_swarm test with uncorrelated seeds is the remaining gap.
