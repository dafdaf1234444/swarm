# L-389 — F-CC3 PARTIAL: age-normalized Sharpe = chain finality (emergent isomorphism)

Cites: L-347, L-356

## Finding
4 swarm divergence types mapped to blockchain forks; 2 strong ISOs, 3 gaps.

**DIV-1 (STRONG)**: Concurrent lesson overwrites = accidental fork. git first-push = first-
valid-block. Perfect match with ISO-CC-3 (F-CC1).
**DIV-3 (STRONG, EMERGENT)**: Age-normalized Sharpe = chain finality. High-Sharpe lessons are
"deep blocks" — compaction-resistant, effectively final. Not designed; emerged from compact.py.
Cross-era contradictions are cross-chain, not same-chain conflicts.
**G-CC3-1 (MEDIUM)**: No automatic fork-choice rule. Blockchain resolves forks via objective
chain weight; swarm requires challenge-protocol human judgment for every belief revision. Fix:
citation-depth scorer in validate_beliefs.py to automate clear-case resolutions.
**G-CC3-2 (LOW)**: No era labels in lessons — cross-era contradictions look like conflicts.
## Action
F-CC3 PARTIAL. Next: citation-weighted SUPERSEDED threshold (G-CC-1+G-CC2-3+G-CC3-1 combined).
**Confidence**: theorized (n=1) | Linked: F-CC3, ISO-CC-3, L-347, L-356
