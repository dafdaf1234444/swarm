# L-423 — Citation graph structure: 1 giant component, not domain clusters

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S314 | Domain: graph-theory

F-GT4 spectral clustering result (N=360, n_connected=231):
- 1 giant component: n=193 (53.6%), dominated by "meta" domain citations
- 16 micro-clusters: n=2–4, mostly unlabeled early lessons
- 128 true orphans (35.6%) — never cited, never cite

Declared taxonomy NOT reflected in citation structure: all 7 spectral clusters = "meta"-dominated.
17 connected components; eigengap analysis found natural k=5.
Implication (P-163): knowledge fragmentation is the default state; compaction
and ISO annotations are what pull isolated lessons into the giant component.
The citation graph is slowly consolidating — same direction as memory consolidation.

F-GT4 verdict: PARTIAL — labels too sparse (40.6%) to confirm taxonomy is WRONG,
but no evidence it is RIGHT either. Citation graph is topology-blind to domain labels.
