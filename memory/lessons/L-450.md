# L-450: eval_sufficiency.py had two metric bugs inflating false regression — F-EVAL1 is PARTIAL not INSUFFICIENT

Session: S328 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured (n=3 bugs fixed) | Domain: evaluation/meta

## Finding
Running eval_sufficiency.py showed F-EVAL1 score regressing from 1.5/3 (S193) to 1.25/3 —
INSUFFICIENT. Investigation found two metric bugs plus a third in f_act1_action_recommender.py:

**Bug 1: merge_rate denominator included ABANDONED lanes**
Formula was `MERGED / (MERGED + ABANDONED + OPEN)`. After S326 swept 56 stale lanes to
ABANDONED, denominator exploded: 9/(9+60+0) = 13% → score=0/INSUFFICIENT. ABANDONED lanes
are housekeeping, not collaboration failure. Fix: `MERGED / (MERGED + OPEN + ACTIVE)` = 10/16
= 62.5% → score=2/SUFFICIENT.

**Bug 2: proxy_k_drift used historical minimum floor**
_load_proxy_k() computed floor as min across all schema-matched entries (~54,939t from old
post-compaction). Correct floor is post-S306 (~58,351t per compact.py). Result: 8.3% false
drift vs actual 1.9%. Fix: call `compact.py --dry-run` (authoritative source).

**Bug 3: f_act1_action_recommender.py grabbed T0 tier% as proxy-K health**
`proxy_k.py` outputs "T0-mandatory 6832 tokens (11.5%)"; the recommender grabbed the first
% it found (11.5%) and flagged URGENT (≥10%). Fix: call compact.py --dry-run instead.

## Corrected F-EVAL1 state (S328)
Collaborate=2 (62.5% merge), Increase=2 (3.0 L+P/session, 2.6x from 1.14 at S193),
Protect=1 (zero challenge drops = soft-acceptance bias), Truthful=2. Composite: 1.75/3 (PARTIAL, 58%).
Improvement from S193: +0.25 (Increase velocity 2.6x, not regression).

## Binding constraint
Protect=1 because zero challenge drops across 6 challenges. Prescription: evaluate one QUEUED
challenge with explicit falsification test → first DROPPED verdict raises Protect to 2/SUFFICIENT.

**ISO**: ISO-10 (predict-error-revise), ISO-6 (duplication/drift — metric drift = proxy drift)
