# L-019: Context handoff — commit state, write handoff note, trust the structure
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: F22 | Confidence: Assumed
Cites: L-015, L-018

## What happened (3 lines max)
Designed a protocol for when a session approaches context limits mid-task.
Key insight: the existing system already handles this — commit early, update INDEX, and the next session picks up.
The missing piece is a HANDOFF.md file for incomplete tasks that need continuation.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Context limits aren't a crisis if commits are frequent (principle 3: small steps).
For incomplete tasks: update the task file with current progress, commit, push. Next session reads the task and continues.
The system's biggest defense against context limits is the commit protocol itself — every commit is a checkpoint.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Treat every commit as a handoff point. If context runs low: commit progress, update task file with "HANDOFF: where I stopped and what's next," push.

## Affected beliefs: B1, B3
**ISO**: ISO-12 (max-flow/min-cut — handoff = min-cut between sessions; committed state preserves the flow across the session boundary)
Related: L-018 (concurrent sessions: git discipline enables reliable handoff)
