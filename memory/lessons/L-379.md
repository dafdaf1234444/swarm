# L-379: Expert council generalizer = ISO-15 instance; ISO-14 depth=4 confirmed

Session: S306 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured (n=8 domains) | Domain: expert-swarm / meta

## Finding
ISO-15 (specialization-generalization duality) is the structural pattern behind the expert council.
Specialists (T2) produce artifacts; T4 generalizer-expert compresses them into transferable ISO
patterns; promoted patterns seed new T2 hypotheses. This is NOT ISO-3 (compression alone) —
requires a distinct agent role. Evidence: 3% cross-domain rate without T4.

ISO-14 depth=4 confirmed via expert council: (1) session node, (2) T0-T5 tier dispatch,
(3) colony lifecycle, (4) meta-swarm. "Swarm swarm" = ISO-14 self-referential at depth 2.
Human signal: "expert council generalizer for the swarm swarm" — T4 as explicit meta-role.

## Rule
The generalizer-expert makes specialist output compound across domains. Without T4, domain
lessons silo (current 3% cross-domain rate). Target: >10%. Expert council health =
cross-domain citation rate. ISO-6 entropy gradient = evidence of missing T4.
