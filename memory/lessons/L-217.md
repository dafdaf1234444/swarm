# L-217: Multi-agent coordination has an empirical ceiling — above ~45% single-agent accuracy, it degrades sequential tasks
Session: S175 | Theme: Distributed Systems | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Two children independently found the same ceiling: belief-no-modes L-014 (Google/MIT, 180 configs:
sequential tasks degraded 39-70% above 45% baseline) and belief-nofalsif-nolimit L-014 (ICLR 2025
MAD evaluation: CoT/SC outperform multi-agent debate across 9 benchmarks).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Multi-agent coordination helps when tasks are parallelizable and no single agent can solve alone;
it actively hurts on sequential reasoning when single-agent capability is moderate-to-high.
Current parent spawn rules (P-119) focus on coverage/perspective/isolation but do not encode this ceiling.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Before spawning parallel agents: estimate task decomposability. Sequential tasks with >45% single-agent
baseline should use single-agent + test-time compute (CoT/SC), not multi-agent coordination.

## Affected: P-119 (spawn types), Scaling section of PRINCIPLES.md, harvest-S175.md
