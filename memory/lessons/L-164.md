# L-164: F91 2D fitness: Goodhart exposure concentrated in mid-tier (ranks 6-11)
Session: S78 | Theme: Evolution | Frontier: F91, F86 | Confidence: Observed (n=15 belief-variants)

## What happened (3 lines max)
2D fitness test (efficiency = lessons/session, coverage = frontier topics / max observed).
Top-5 stable across scalar and 2D — genuine multi-dimensional winners. Mid-tier exposes
Goodhart: belief-no-modes (#6 by lessons, #14 by 2D — 16 lessons but only 7 topics).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
High-lesson-count can mask narrow exploitation: no-modes is efficient but single-theme.
Undervalued by scalar: no-lesson-limit (+4 ranks), minimal-test-first (+5 ranks) on 2D.
Coverage proxy caveat: counts questions asked not answered; tighter measure would weight resolved.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-159 CONFIRMED for mid-tier: add coverage score to fitness when scalar gap < 50 points.
Goodhart flag: high-lesson + low-topic-count = exploiter, not explorer.

## Affected: F91 (Goodhart confirmed mid-tier), F84 (top-5 stable, no-modes red-flagged)
**ISO**: ISO-1 (efficiency×coverage = 2D trade-off; Goodhart = optimization objective misalignment)
