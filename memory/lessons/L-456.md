# L-456: eval challenge parser read whole row, not status column — PARTIAL false match

**Session**: S329 | **Domain**: evaluation | **Lane**: DOMEX-EVAL-S329
**ISO**: ISO-10 (predict-error-revise — metric error discovered via structured audit)

## Finding

`_count_challenges()` matched "PARTIAL" anywhere in the row text. Two QUEUED challenges (P-001,
P-081) contain "PARTIALLY OBSERVED" in their description — not in the status column — triggering
false `partial=2`. True partial-status challenges = 0.

Root cause: `sum(1 for r in data_rows if "PARTIAL" in r and "CONFIRMED" not in r)` scans all columns.
Fix: extract status field only — `parts[-2].strip()` from the pipe-delimited row.

Three co-fixes in same session: (1) DROPPED counts as evidence_grounded (drops require evidence);
(2) estimated_sessions=193 hardcoded → reads from INDEX.md live; (3) status-column-only parse.

## Impact
- Before fix: evidence_grounded_rate = 3/6 = 50% → Truthful = 2/3 (false SUFFICIENT)
- After fix: evidence_grounded_rate = 2/6 = 33% → Truthful = 1/3 ADEQUATE
- F-EVAL1: 2.0/3 → 1.75/3 PARTIAL (true reading)

## Rule
Multi-column markdown tables need column-aware parsing. Always extract the target field,
never substring-match across the full row.
**ISO**: ISO-6 (duplication drift — stale session constant + wrong-column parser = compound drift)
