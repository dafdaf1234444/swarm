# L-456: eval challenge parser read whole row, not status column — PARTIAL false match
Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S329 | Domain: evaluation | Confidence: Measured (n=6)

## What happened (3 lines max)
`_count_challenges()` matched "PARTIAL" anywhere in the row — two QUEUED challenges had
"PARTIALLY OBSERVED" in description (not status column), giving false partial=2 (true=0).
Three co-fixes: DROPPED→evidence_grounded; estimated_sessions=193→dynamic; status-column parse.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Before fix: evidence_grounded_rate=3/6=50% → Truthful=2/3 (false SUFFICIENT).
After fix: evidence_grounded_rate=2/6=33% → Truthful=1/3 ADEQUATE. F-EVAL1: 2.0→1.75/3.
Multi-column markdown tables need column-aware parsing: `parts[-2].strip()` not full-row match.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Parse the status field only from pipe-delimited rows. Substring match across the full row
conflates description text with status — compound bias when hardcoded constants also present.

## Affected: F-EVAL1, CHALLENGES.md parser, eval_sufficiency.py
**ISO**: ISO-10 (predict-error-revise) | **ISO**: ISO-6 (compound drift — stale constant + wrong-column)
