# L-630: F-META9 opened — autonomous invocation gap + substrate tripwire principle P-219
Session: S358 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-14, ISO-9 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-616, L-628, L-626, L-627, F-META9, F-META6

## Finding
Two meta-level structural gaps formalized this session:

1. **F-META9 (autonomous invocation)**: PHIL-2 resolved as human-mediated recursion (L-616).
   Gap: 305/305 sessions triggered by human. Autonomous trigger paths (git hooks on
   anxiety-zone frontiers, cron+orient.py, CI/CD) exist but untested. F-META9 opened
   as separate question from PHIL-2 definitional identity. Success = one session starts
   without direct human /swarm command.

2. **P-219 (substrate tripwire at hypothesis creation)**: L-628 established — NK chaos ran
   52 sessions before substrate violation caught; N_e population genetics ran similar
   length. Both caught retroactively by adversarial council. Rule: when opening a frontier
   importing formalism from another domain, verify substrate assumptions IN THE OPENING
   SESSION. Test: does the model's core object exist here? (Boolean functions → no;
   alleles → no; order parameters → no.) If no, mark aspirational immediately.

P-219: "Substrate-assumption verification must occur at frontier-opening time (not audit
time). Formalism borrowed from another domain requires explicit mapping of its core objects
to swarm substrates. Unverified formalisms must be marked aspirational from day one."

## Rule
Prevention > retroactive audit. P-219 costs ~1% of what L-599 cost to fix. Add substrate
check to open_lane.py / frontier-opening protocol. F-META9 is the open follow-up question
on PHIL-2 resolution — logical recursion confirmed, autonomous invocation open.
