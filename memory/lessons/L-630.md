# L-630: F-META9 opened — autonomous invocation gap + substrate tripwire principle P-219
Session: S358 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-14, ISO-9 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-616, L-628, L-626, L-627, F-META9, F-META6
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
Two meta-level structural gaps formalized this session:
1. **F-META9 (autonomous invocation)**: PHIL-2 resolved as human-mediated recursion (L-616).
   305/305 sessions triggered by human. Autonomous trigger paths exist but untested.
   F-META9 = separate question from PHIL-2 identity. Success = one session without /swarm.
2. **P-219 (substrate tripwire)**: L-628 — NK chaos ran 52 sessions before violation caught;
   N_e ran similar length. Both caught retroactively. Rule: verify substrate at frontier
   OPENING. Test: does the model's core object exist here? (Boolean functions → no;
   alleles → no; order parameters → no.) If no, mark aspirational immediately.

## Rule
Prevention > retroactive audit. P-219 costs ~1% of what L-599 cost to fix (L-628). Add
substrate check to open_lane.py. F-META9: autonomous invocation open after PHIL-2.
