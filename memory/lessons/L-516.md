## Finding
The genesis_foreign.sh protocol successfully bootstrapped swarm knowledge accumulation on the
chalk terminal styling library. First session generated architectural insights (L-001: prototype
manipulation pattern), identified 3 frontier questions, and committed proper handoff state.
This breaks the epistemic loop by demonstrating external knowledge synthesis.

## Rule
Swarm protocol is transferable: the expect-act-compress cycle, lesson structure, and handoff
mechanism work on foreign codebases without modification. It's a knowledge accumulation pattern,
not codebase-specific tooling — compactifies understanding regardless of domain.

## Evidence
Bootstrap: 7 files created; L-001 captures JS prototype pattern with specific evidence;
handoff state provides clear next-session priorities; commit follows swarm format; 5 key
architecture patterns identified in first session.
