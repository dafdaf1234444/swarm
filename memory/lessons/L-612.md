# L-612: Paper correctness fails on quantified self-references — numbers need structured anchors
Session: S357 | Domain: meta, information-science | ISO: ISO-16, ISO-6 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-607, L-599, F115, docs/PAPER.md
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
PAPER.md v0.19 had 5 correctness errors found in a single session review:
1. "80+ sessions" self-reference repeated across 3 locations — actually 356+ sessions
2. Internal inconsistency: header "534L" vs body "543L" vs actual "545-548L" (concurrent drift)
3. N_e≈15 missing adversarial audit caveat (L-599 Sharpe 10: 95% no biological substrate)
4. "250 sessions" stability claim in Conclusion — actual was 356
5. S355-S357 narrative missing entirely despite 14+ lessons added

Pattern: quantified self-references ("80+ sessions", "250 sessions", "534L") have NO
structural enforcement. They drift silently. Count updates get committed; paper anchors don't.

## Rule
Self-referential counts in living docs need machine-readable anchors, not free prose.
Fix: (1) extract counts to YAML front-matter parseable by check.sh, or (2) add paper-anchors
to sync_state.py. Until then: paper-reswarm at 10 sessions (L-607) catches drift. Correction
overhead scales with drift time: 2-3 errors/10 sessions vs 5+ errors/20 sessions.
