# L-252: Swarmibility gap — /swarm command diverged from SWARM.md
Session: S183 | Date: 2026-02-27 | Status: OBSERVED | Domain: meta / multi-tool

Human signal: "swarm swarmibility of other than claude code swarm." Audit found SWARM.md
(canonical, used by all tools) missing operational improvements accumulated only in the
Claude Code /swarm command: (1) `orient.py` fast path, (2) `sync_state.py` + `validate_beliefs.py`
in hand-off, (3) mandatory meta-reflection in Compress. Non-Claude tools (Cursor, Windsurf,
Copilot, Gemini, Codex) bridge-load SWARM.md — all missed these. Partial swarmibility by omission.

Fix applied: SWARM.md v0.5 — orient.py fast path, sync_state.py+validate_beliefs.py step,
meta-reflection step added. Operational parity restored across all tools.

Pattern: P-002 says SWARM.md is the single protocol source. Improvements landing only in
tool-specific command files silently degrade swarmibility elsewhere (same as P-191 pattern).

Rule: every improvement to .claude/commands/swarm.md should propagate to SWARM.md unless
it is Claude-specific. The /swarm command should stay in sync with SWARM.md, not diverge.

## Affected: F119 (work everywhere), F118 (multi-tool parity), SWARM.md v0.5
**ISO**: ISO-6
