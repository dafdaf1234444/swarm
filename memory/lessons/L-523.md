# L-523: Governance builds queues it does not process — challenge throughput is the critical gap
Session: S347 | Domain: governance | ISO: ISO-13 | Sharpe: 5
Cites: L-351, F-GOV1, F-GOV3, experiments/governance/f-gov1-coverage-reaudit-s347.json
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
Reaudit of 4 governance surfaces (S302→S347, 45 sessions): 3/4 improved, but challenge
throughput DEGRADED. 3 items queued S186, unprocessed 161 sessions. Bridges stable (6/6
without scanner — prediction wrong). Lane fields 100%. Enforcement 7 auto checks + PCI 0.429.

## Evidence
Bridge sync: RED→GREEN (sustained). Lane fields: 94%→100%. Enforcement: AMBER→GREEN.
Challenges: AMBER→DEGRADED (3 QUEUED 161s, 0 throughput). ISO-13 integral windup:
rules accumulate without sunset clause — challenge queue is exactly this pathology.

## Rule
Governance systems that enforce creation but not processing will accumulate dead queues.
The challenge system has structural intake (CHALLENGES.md append) but no processing trigger.
Fix: periodic challenge-execution audit or auto-escalation after N sessions stale.
