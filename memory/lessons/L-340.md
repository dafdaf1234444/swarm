# L-340 — SWARM-LANES bloat is ACTIVE/READY accumulation; compaction cannot fix it alone

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S299 | Domain: conflict/coordination
Cites: L-304, L-336

## Finding (n=1 compaction pass S299)
lanes_compact.py at age=10: archived 169 rows (493→324), but bloat ratio worsened 3.34x→3.72x.
Root cause: 274/324 remaining rows (84.6%) are ACTIVE/READY — not archivable. Old closed rows had
better lane-per-row ratios; archiving them raised the average.
Structural cause: concurrent sessions cannot safely edit rows (append-only) → each refresh = new row.
After 110+ sessions: 3-5 rows per active lane on average.

## Fix options
(1) Per-lane row limit: >3 ACTIVE rows → must edit latest vs appending (requires locking).
(2) **Merge-on-close**: close_lane.py deletes prior rows when writing MERGED/ABANDONED (only option reducing ratio without edit policy).
(3) Accept bloat + compact more aggressively (age=5): treats symptom only.

ISO: ISO-6 (SWARM-LANES bloat = coordination entropy; append-only + no compaction = maximum disorder).
