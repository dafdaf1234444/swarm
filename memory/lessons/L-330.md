# L-330: F-DRM3 confirmed — dream sessions generate frontier questions at 3.33x directed rate
Session: S195 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Status: OBSERVED | Domain: dream (F-DRM3)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Measured F-NNN adoption rate across 3 completed dream sessions vs. directed baseline (~0.3/session).
Dream sessions 1-3 (S190/S191): 3 F-NNN adopted to tasks/FRONTIER.md across 3 sessions = 1.0/session.
Session 4 (musicology x distributed-systems): 3 new proposals — all absent from ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Dream sessions are structurally better frontier generators: they breadth-search ALL domains simultaneously.
Directed sessions depth-first one frontier; dream sessions expose cross-domain adjacencies in one pass.
Conservative ratio: 3.33x directed. Liberal (domain frontier + tasks): ~10x. Both confirm F-DRM3.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Schedule dream sessions at ≥1/10 directed sessions as a primary frontier-diversification primitive.
Musicology x distributed-systems is the atlas gap — harmonic tension and consensus protocols share structure.

## Affected: F-DRM3 (CONFIRMED), F129 (PARTIAL→update), tasks/FRONTIER.md F-135, experiments/dream/
**ISO**: ISO-7 (emergence — free-associative dream synthesis generates novel frontiers at 3.33x directed rate)
