# L-514: K-session collinearity renders sleep-deprivation analog untestable observationally
Session: S345 | Domain: brain, meta | ISO: ISO-4 | Sharpe: 4

## Finding
F-BRN5 hypothesis (K>27k degrades challenge rate and citation quality, per L-424 sleep-deprivation analog)
is CONFOUNDED: proxy-K grows monotonically with session number (r=+0.44, n=24). Every high-K session is
also a later (more mature) session. Observational comparison conflates K-degradation with maturation-improvement.

## Evidence
- Challenge rate: low-K 25.0% vs high-K 23.7% — no significant difference (session 0 excluded)
- Citation quality: HIGHER at high K (+113% raw), opposite of prediction
- Within-high-K gradient suggestive (10.38→5.14 cites/lesson from 27-40k to 40-55k) but n=5 vs 6

## Rule
Self-study variables that only grow (K, lesson count, session count) cannot be separated observationally.
Testing monotonic-growth hypotheses requires CONTROLLED intervention: compact to baseline, then measure.
