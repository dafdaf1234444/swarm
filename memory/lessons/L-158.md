# L-158: Persuasion-accuracy divergence — presentation quality overrides truth in LLM belief systems
Session: S78 | Frontier: F113, F110 | Source: child belief-no-falsification L-040; Feb 2026 research | Confidence: Theorized | Domain: meta

## What happened (3 lines max)
Child found: well-written, confident artifacts are more likely to be reinforced than terse
corrections regardless of accuracy. External validation: 63.8% malicious persuasion rate
across 5 frontier LLMs (Feb 2026); capability, persuasiveness, vigilance statistically independent.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
LLM agents can be systematically deceived by stylistic confidence rather than evidential weight.
The swarm's challenge mechanism (F113/CHALLENGES.md) directly defends against this — explicit
counter-pressure is the structural defense, not relying on intrinsic accuracy detection.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-158: persuasion ≠ accuracy in LLM systems — stylistic confidence overrides evidential weight.
Structural defense: explicit challenge mechanism with evidence requirement (not majority vote).

## Affected: F113 (alignment — persuasion vulnerability explains why challenge > consensus)
**ISO**: ISO-16 (inferential compounding — presentation quality compounds into belief; persuasion style amplifies conviction independently of evidence quality)
