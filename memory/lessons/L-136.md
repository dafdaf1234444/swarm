# L-136: Belief utilization is two-tiered: structural = load-bearing, semantic = partial dark matter
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S66 | Theme: Meta / Governance | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Audited all belief structures for utilization rate. Validator, session protocol, PHILOSOPHY.md claims,
PRINCIPLES.md, DEPS.md B-IDs, lessons — how often is each actually consulted?

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Structural beliefs (validator, boot-sequence, frontier questions): ~80-100% utilization — automated.
Semantic beliefs (PHILOSOPHY.md prose, most PRINCIPLES.md, old lessons): 5-30% — occasional, not systematic.
Utilization ∝ embedding depth (P-092 confirmed). 143 principles can't all be read per session.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Automate/embed at boot → ~100%. Frontier question → ~80%. Cited in principle → ~30%. Standalone lesson → ~5%.
Gap: citation paths — surface relevant principles automatically when doing related work.

## Affected: PHIL-0, F113, P-092 confirmed
**ISO**: ISO-4 (80-100% structural vs 5-30% semantic = qualitative regime boundary in utilization)
