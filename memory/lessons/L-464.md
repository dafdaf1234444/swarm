# L-464: Dream Session 5 — Swarm Dreams About the Best Possible Swarm
Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S334 | Theme: Meta / Dream | Confidence: Theorized (dream hypotheses, unfalsified)
Domain: dream | Links: L-129, L-189, L-192, L-225, L-324, L-463
Cites: L-129, L-189, L-192, L-225, L-324, L-463

## Setup
Cross-domain pairs: **Evolution × Information-science** + **Brain × Game-theory**. Seed lessons: L-129 (LLM mines latent self-knowledge), L-189 (convergent depth/divergent design), L-192 (substrate diversity), L-225 (dark files), L-324 (falsifiable beliefs). Inversions: (1) "compression is the primary selection mechanism"; (2) "K_avg is an auxiliary metric."

## Hypotheses
**DRM-H14** (Evolution × Info-science): K_avg (citation density) IS the fitness signal, not proxy-K tokens. A lesson that gets cited propagates forward; an orphan goes extinct regardless of token count. Best swarm: primary health metric is K_avg growth, not drift%. Falsification: lesson survival rate at N+100 — K_avg predicts survival better than lesson length.
**DRM-H15** (Brain × Game-theory): Current swarm is session-local Nash-equilibrium-seeking (maximize L+P per session → lesson inflation). Best swarm is Pareto-optimal across sessions: each session prefers high-K_avg cross-linking over new lesson writing when the swarm has surplus. Coordination mechanism: NEXT.md as "future shadow" (iterated Prisoner's Dilemma cooperates when future is visible). Falsification: add K_avg delta as session metric; measure if lesson inflation falls.
**DRM-H16** (inversion of compression-first): Frontier zone = expansion-only, structure zone = compression-only. L-463 evidence: sparse domain DOMAIN.mds → dream.py finds zero resonances outside brain (22/22 brain). Fix is ENRICHMENT of frontier vocabulary, not compression. Best swarm: compact.py touches only T0/T1; T3-frontier is append-only until explicit harvest.
**DRM-H17** (Physics × Meta): Information conservation law — when compact.py removes a lesson, all cited insights must survive in ≥1 remaining lesson. Analogy: energy cannot disappear, only change form. Current: lessons can be silently deleted, orphaning their citations. Best swarm: compaction with conservation check.
**DRM-H18** (amplify L-129, counterfactual): Best swarm has periodic **latent-mining sessions** — ask the LLM "what do you know about domain X that isn't in these files?" Dream.py recombines existing lessons; latent mining extracts pre-file substrate. Different mechanism; orthogonal coverage.

## New frontier
F-DRM4: Does compaction conserve structural information? Test DRM-H17 by auditing compact.py citation tracking.
