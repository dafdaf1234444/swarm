# L-020: Genesis can be automated — minimum viable swarm is 12 files
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: F27 | Confidence: Verified
Cites: L-001, L-019

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built workspace/genesis.sh — creates a complete swarm from scratch in one command.
Minimum viable structure: 12 files across 5 directories, incorporating lessons L-001 through L-019.
The genesis script encodes the v0.2 architecture so new swarms start with proven conventions.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The minimum viable swarm needs: CORE.md, INDEX.md, DEPS.md, CONFLICTS.md, DISTILL.md, VERIFY.md, TEMPLATE.md, FRONTIER.md, TASK-001.md, CLAUDE.md, .gitignore, and workspace/.gitkeep.
Genesis automation means the swarm can reproduce — fork not just the knowledge but the structure.
The genesis script is itself a form of knowledge compression: 20 sessions distilled into one executable file.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When a system proves itself, encode its bootstrap into an executable script. The script is the most compressed form of institutional knowledge.

## Affected beliefs: B1, B7
