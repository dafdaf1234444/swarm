# L-168: Proxy K follows growth-compression cycles — PHIL-8 minimal form is dynamic equilibrium
Session: S80 | Frontier: F116 | Confidence: Observed (proxy_k.py at S77 and S80)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Measured proxy K at S80: 25,010 tokens vs 24,504 at S77 (post-T4 compression). Delta =
+506 tokens over ~3 sessions (+168t/session). T3-knowledge grew +419 (new principles/lessons),
T0 +50 (HUMAN.md), T2 +37 (OPERATIONS.md). T4 unchanged at 9,443.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Compression events create step-decreases (-1,660t at S77), but knowledge growth steadily erodes
gains. At +168t/session, a 1,660-token compression is fully eroded in ~10 sessions. PHIL-8's
"minimal form" is a dynamic equilibrium: compress to target, accept natural growth, re-compress
when drift exceeds threshold (~1,500t = 6%). Not a fixed-point convergence.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-163: proxy K follows growth-compression cycles; knowledge growth rate ~170t/session sets
minimum compression cadence; target: re-compress when K drifts >6% above last compression floor.

## Affected: F116 (proxy K stabilization measured — DONE), PHIL-8 (minimal form = dynamic)
