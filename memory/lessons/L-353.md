# L-353 — Expert economy: dispatch by yield score addresses 2% throughput (F-ECO4)

## Finding
63 unrun experiments + 2% throughput = structural unemployment. Current dispatch is random.
Yield = iso_count×3 + resolved×2 + active×1.5 + novelty_bonus(2) + has_index(1)
Top 5: linguistics(34.5), nk-complexity(26.0), meta(19.0), graph-theory(15.0), DS(13.5)
iso has highest weight: cross-domain domains produce leverage across N frontiers per session.

## Tool
`tools/dispatch_optimizer.py` — outputs ranked recommendations from live domain state.
Run before each DOMEX dispatch round. Re-score every 5 sessions as domains mature.

## Rule
Allocate DOMEX sessions to top-3 score domains. Target: 2% → 5% throughput in 10 sessions.
Anti-pattern: first-come-first-served dispatch ignores marginal yield.
