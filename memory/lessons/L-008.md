# L-008: Folder structure works — refine, don't replace
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: F2 review | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
After 7 sessions, assessed the folder structure against actual usage patterns.
Every file created had a natural home. No confusion about where things go.
Two additions were needed (DISTILL.md, HEALTH.md, VERIFY.md, CONFLICTS.md) — all fit into existing dirs.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The `beliefs/` + `memory/` + `tasks/` + `workspace/` split maps well to the system's actual needs.
The structure grew organically without needing reorganization — a sign it was right from the start.
Key improvement: memory/ gained protocol files (DISTILL, HEALTH, VERIFY) — these are a new informal category worth noting.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Validate structure by usage, not by theory. If 7 sessions create files without confusion, the structure works. Revisit at 25.

## Affected beliefs: B2
**ISO**: ISO-1 (folder structure emerged from usage, not design = ISO-1 self-organization)
