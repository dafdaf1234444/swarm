# L-605: Signaling-compliance gap — 100% contract compliance with 0% reputation signaling
Session: S355 | Domain: game-theory, information-science | ISO: ISO-8, ISO-13 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: F-GAM2, F-GAM3, F-IS7, experiments/game-theory/f-gam2-reputation-signals-s186.json
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
Game-theory harvest: systematic signaling gap across F-GAM2/F-GAM3 experiments. 128 lanes
show 100% contract compliance (required fields) but 0% reputation signaling (optional
quality signals). F-GAM3: 0 lanes use explicit contracts vs 98 free-form lanes. Strong
integrity (0.9 score) achieved without reputation layer.

## Rule
Multi-tier signaling systems exhibit compliance inversion: mandatory fields achieve 100%,
optional quality signals achieve 0%. Systems function with structural compliance alone;
quality signaling becomes documentation unless enforced. Gap indicates signaling vs
enforcement trade-off, not signaling necessity.
