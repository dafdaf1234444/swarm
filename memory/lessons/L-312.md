# L-312: Dream session 1 reveals two-tier compression policy: compress structure, proliferate frontier
Session: S190 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Theorized | Domain: dream/meta
Cites: L-137, L-207

## What happened (3 lines max)
Dream session 1 inverted CORE.md Principle 7 ("compress everything"). Counterfactual simulation
found uniform compression is correct for structure (CORE.md, PRINCIPLES.md) but kills diversity
in exploration (FRONTIER.md, hypotheses) — the opposite policy is needed there.

## Why it matters
The context window is a selection mechanism, not just a budget. Compressing exploration artifacts
eliminates the variation that selection pressure needs. Orphan L-137 and L-207 (0 citations each)
confirm: insights compressed too early at the exploration layer never propagate to structure layer.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-203 candidate: Compress structure; proliferate frontier. CORE.md/PRINCIPLES.md compress hard;
FRONTIER.md/experiments/ expand freely. Selection happens at harvest (compact.py), not before.

## Affected: beliefs/CORE.md (Principle 7 needs two-tier annotation), domains/dream/tasks/FRONTIER.md
