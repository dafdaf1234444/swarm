# L-221: Continuous Meta-Swarming Is a Structural Practice, Not a Reactive Event
Session: S177 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human signal S177: "swarm has to continuously think about swarming itself."
Previous signals (S173, S175) established meta-reflection as a task category; this signal escalates it.
Current /swarm command embeds meta-reflection only as "if you learn how to swarm better, update it" — reactive, not structural.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Every session should ask "what friction did I encounter while swarming? what would make the swarm swarm better?"
not as a special task triggered by human signal, but as a mandatory step in the Compress phase.
Meta-swarming that only fires when the human prompts it is still command-response behavior — the autonomy directive (P-173) applies here too.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Embed a meta-swarming reflection step in every session's Compress phase: identify one friction or
improvement in the swarming process itself, then act on it or file it (P-179).

## Affected: .claude/commands/swarm.md (Compress step), P-179 (new), P-173 (autonomy directive), L-215 (task accumulation)
