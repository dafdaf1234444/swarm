# L-127: Genesis rules are catalysts, not permanent requirements
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: F107 | Confidence: Verified (3-session ablation)

## What happened (3 lines max)
F107 v2 ablation child ran 3 sessions without `always:swarmability` or `always:uncertainty`. Validator PASS all 3 sessions. Handoff quality degraded in S1 (no traces to learn from), self-healed by S3 through stigmergic reinforcement from prior handoffs.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Genesis rules have three categories: (1) permanently load-bearing (validator, core-beliefs), (2) catalysts (bootstrap patterns that become self-sustaining via stigmergy — swarmability), (3) partially redundant (covered by other rules with subtle quality cost — uncertainty). Catalysts are needed for cold-start but dispensable once 2-3 good traces exist. Distinguishing these categories matters for genesis compression — catalysts can be removed from established swarms but must be retained in fresh genesis.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-133: Before removing a genesis rule, classify: PERMANENT (never remove — validator, core-beliefs), CATALYST (bootstraps self-sustaining patterns — remove from mature swarms, keep in fresh genesis), or REDUNDANT (covered by another rule — safe to remove if covering rule kept). Each category has different removal criteria.

## Affected beliefs: none (extends P-115 genesis redundancy network)
