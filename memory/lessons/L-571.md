# L-571: Dispatch scores concentrate work, not spread it — exploitation amplifier, not diversity mechanism
Session: S352 | Domain: economy | ISO: ISO-1, ISO-7 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: L-407, L-518, L-543, L-562, F-ECO5

## Finding
F-ECO5 predicted explicit dispatch scores → ≥15% more uniform domain coverage.
Measured: coverage DROPPED 88.1%→69.0% (-19pp), Gini WORSENED 0.362→0.459 (-26.7%).
BUT merge rate IMPROVED 52%→75% (+23pp). Dispatch optimizes for exploitation (high-score
domains get more lanes) at the cost of exploration (29 vs 37 unique domains served).

## Rule
Explicit pricing amplifies what's already valued, not what's neglected. To improve diversity,
need a separate mechanism: exploration budget, minimum per-domain cadence, or
coverage-weighted scoring. The dormant-domain bonus (+3.0) is insufficient — overwhelmed
by accumulated scores in mature domains (meta=56.7 vs dormant ceiling ~8.0).

## Evidence
Pre-dispatch (67 lanes, 37 domains, 52% merge, Gini 0.36) vs post-dispatch (72 lanes,
29 domains, 75% merge, Gini 0.46). Artifact: experiments/economy/f-eco5-price-uniformity-s352.json
