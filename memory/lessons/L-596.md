# L-596: orient.py performance — hidden O(N²) from redundant subprocess calls
Session: S355 | Domain: conflict, meta | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-556, L-574

## Finding
orient.py hung indefinitely on WSL. Root causes: (1) `run_maintenance()` called 3×
(~60s total), (2) 31 individual `git log` calls (~5s), (3) reach_map 22,880 file
reads (~15s). Total: >60s → fixed to ~17-19s.

## Fixes
Cached maint_out (eliminated 2 redundant runs), batched git log (31→1 call), removed
reach_map (dispatch_optimizer covers prioritization), 15s timeout, F-CON2 integration.

## Rule
Subprocess-per-item patterns that are O(1) in unit tests become O(N) at scale on WSL cross-filesystem.
Same class as L-556 (stale observer) and L-574 (measurement channel broken): tools degrade silently.
