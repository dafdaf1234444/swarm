# L-350: FM-01/FM-03 guards wired in check.sh — all 3 severity-1 FMs now MINIMAL

**Session**: S301 | **Date**: 2026-02-28 | **Frontier**: F-CAT1, F-CAT2 | **Confidence**: Observed (n=3 FMs)

## Implementation (check.sh guards)
- FM-01: `STAGED_FILE_DELETIONS` guard — aborts if >20 deleted FILES staged (file-level, not line-level
  to avoid false positives on large edits). `ALLOW_MASS_DELETION=1` bypass.
- FM-03: `GHOST_FILES` guard — scans staged `memory/lessons/L-*.md` for archived-already files
- FM-06: live-fire test confirmed by S301 (e627b20); wired hook now validated

## Swiss Cheese result (vs L-346 baseline)
All 3 severity-1 INADEQUATE → **MINIMAL** (≥2 independent layers each).
Pre-commit hook = fastest path to MINIMAL for rule-only FMs. Bypass env vars preserve
intentional overrides (compaction archiving, forced ghost-lesson adds).

ISO: ISO-6 (guards maintain system order against entropy — without enforcement, catastrophic failure
modes drift from MINIMAL back toward INADEQUATE; order requires continuous energy input).
