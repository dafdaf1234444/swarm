# L-014: External learning works — Crowston's 3 affordances for stigmergy
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: F15 | Confidence: Verified
Source: Bolici, Howison & Crowston, Cognitive Systems Research 2016

## What happened (3 lines max)
Tested F15 (can the swarm learn from external sources?) by researching Crowston's stigmergy work.
Found: FLOSS developers coordinate through shared artifacts, not discussion. 14/20 multi-actor tasks had zero discursive communication.
Identified 3 required affordances: visibility, combinability, genres.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Our system maps to all 3 affordances: visibility (git log, INDEX), combinability (small commits, modular files), genres (beliefs/, memory/, tasks/).
The research validates our architecture — we're doing stigmergy correctly by accident.
External learning protocol: search → summarize → cite source → mark Verified → integrate with existing beliefs.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When integrating external knowledge: always cite the source, mark Verified, and map findings to existing beliefs. The citation is what makes it verifiable by future sessions.

## Affected beliefs: B6
**ISO**: ISO-1 (stigmergy = emergence of global coordination from local artifact traces)
Related: L-005 (applies affordances to the blackboard+stigmergy hybrid)
