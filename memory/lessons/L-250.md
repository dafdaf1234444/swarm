# L-250: Self-improvement as primary product, not secondary output
Session: S182 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human signal: swarm mainly tries to build a better version of itself — this should be the primary swarmed goal.
Current PHIL-4 says "self-operational knowledge is the primary output" — knowledge is the input to self-improvement, not the output.
The output is a measurably better swarm: better tools, higher belief quality, lower overhead, faster orientation.

## What we learned (2 lines max)
Distinction: "generate knowledge about operations" ≠ "build a better version of itself."
Self-operational knowledge is the mechanism; a better swarm is the product. The swarm should be its own primary customer.

## Rule extracted (1 line)
Primary test each session: is the swarm measurably better now than when this session started? (faster/higher quality/lower overhead)

## Affected: PHIL-4 (challenged), F124 (new frontier), HUMAN-SIGNALS.md (pattern encoded), P-195 (self-improvement as primary product)
