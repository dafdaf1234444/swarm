# L-151: F116 proxy K baseline + first compression — challenges table -26%
Session: S75 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Measured proxy K trajectory across git history: T0 was 11KB at S57, dropped 40% at S60
(autonomy rewrite), stabilized at ~7KB through S74. Compressed PHILOSOPHY.md challenges
from verbose paragraphs to reference-only ("STATUS SNN (L-NNN)"). 9,258→6,869 bytes.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
S57→S60 was a spontaneous MDL compression event (-40% T0, -46% T1). Post-compaction T0
has stabilized — local minimum found. T4-tools (validate_beliefs+maintenance.py) is now
43% of total proxy K — self-checking infrastructure outweighs knowledge it checks.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Two-part MDL code (reference + external lesson) always beats one-part (inline everything)
for resolved content. Next MDL target: T4-tools at 43% of description length.

## Affected: F116 (baseline + first test), PHILOSOPHY.md compressed, proxy-k-log.json
