# L-151: F116 proxy K baseline + first compression — challenges table -26%
Session: S75 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Observed
**SUPERSEDED** by P-151 (MDL two-part code beats one-part) + P-163 (proxy K follows growth-compression cycles; T4-tools primary target). Core finding: T4-tools was 43% of total proxy K at S75 — first MDL baseline established. See proxy-k-log.json for trajectory.
**ISO**: ISO-3 (hierarchical compression — proxy-K IS MDL token cost; first compression = reducing K toward minimum description length)
