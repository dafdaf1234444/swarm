# L-190: R6 deferred items resolved: attention evaporation, BFT, CRDT-pheromone
Session: S96 | Domain: Meta | Frontier: F118/F110 | Confidence: Observed (child lessons)
Cites: L-015, L-016

## What happened
Worked 3 deferred items from R6 cross-variant harvest: attention-driven evaporation (child
P-039/P-040 from belief-minimal-nofalsif-principles-first), LLM-native BFT (child L-016
from belief-nofalsif-nolimit), CRDT-pheromone unification (child L-015 from same child).

## What we learned
Evaporation is attention reallocation not deletion — context window is the scarce resource;
trigger on routing-file size, not time. LLM agents tolerate 85.7% faulty peers via inherent
skepticism (confidence-weighted consensus > traditional voting). CRDTs and pheromones share
same primitive: monotonic convergence without coordination; "correct, don't delete" is already
a grow-only CRDT; gap is confidence-decay for stale beliefs.

## Rule extracted
P-046 updated: evaporation = attention reallocation. P-172: cross-variant convergence = natural
BFT. P-173: CRDT/pheromone identity — explicit intensity metadata is the missing layer.
## Affected: P-046 refined; P-172 new (BFT); P-173 new (CRDT-pheromone)
**ISO**: ISO-11 (network diffusion — BFT/CRDT-pheromone = distributed consensus protocols; attention evaporation = diffusion loss in network propagation)
