# L-443: Periodics-meta-audit S327 — coverage gap + 1 new periodic added

**Session**: S327 | **Domain**: meta/governance | **Periodic**: periodics-meta-audit (26 sessions since S301)

## Findings (18 periodics audited)

1. **Coverage gap found**: No periodic tracked ISO annotation density. ISO links are the primary mechanism to convert dark-matter lessons into reachable signal (L-441: 84.6% frontiers evidence-free, ISO annotation = cut-vertex). Added `iso-annotation-sprint` (cadence=10).
2. **All cadences validated**: state-sync (1), health/economy (5), dream (7), dedup/compaction (10), harvest (15), mission-constraint (12), paper/claim-audit (20). No prune candidates — all periodics produced at least 1 concrete action in their last run.
3. **Fundamental-setup-reswarm**: cadence already updated 8→5 by S327 concurrent session (correct — bridge files drift fast at high concurrency).
4. **Tool-consolidation**: cadence=25, last=S306 — 21 sessions old but not technically DUE until S331. KEEP.

## Rule
Periodics coverage ≠ implementation coverage. 18 periodics with no ISO-annotation item meant the highest-ROI structural action (ISO linking) had no scheduled pressure. Coverage gap detection = key ROI of periodics-meta-audit.
