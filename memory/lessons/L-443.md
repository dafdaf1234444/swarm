# L-443: Periodics-meta-audit — coverage gap + cadence calibration (S327+S329)

**Sessions**: S327, S329 | **Domain**: meta/governance | **Periodic**: periodics-meta-audit

## S327 Findings (18 periodics)
1. Added `iso-annotation-sprint` (cadence=10): no periodic tracked ISO density. ISO = cut-vertex to frontiers.
2. All other cadences validated. Fundamental-setup-reswarm: 8→5 (bridge files drift fast).
3. tool-consolidation: cadence=25, last=S306 — nearly due at S331.

## S329 Findings (19 periodics)
1. **iso-annotation-sprint is now dormant**: dark matter = 0% (S328-S329). At cadence=10 it would trigger every session for zero ROI. Updated: cadence 10→30, trigger only when dark matter >15%. This is the key lifecycle lesson: periodics can become obsolete when their trigger condition is satisfied.
2. **periodics-meta-audit field drift**: `last_reviewed_session` was set to S327 by a state-sync pass without actually running the audit. Field ≠ actual audit. Both should be updated explicitly.
3. **Nothing else DUE**: all 19 periodics within cadence window at S329.

## Rule
Periodics must be retired/adjusted when their trigger condition is permanently or temporarily satisfied — otherwise they generate noise. Two failure modes: (a) coverage gap (nothing scheduled for X), (b) zombie periodic (scheduled for X despite X being done). Track both.
**ISO**: ISO-6 (drift surface), ISO-10 (feedback loop — periodic = predict-error-revise for system health)
