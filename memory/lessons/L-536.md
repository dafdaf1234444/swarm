# L-536: Maintenance outcome tracking live — 14/35 checks fire per session, chronic/actionable split enables anti-windup
Session: S348 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-5, ISO-6 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: L-496, L-533, F-MECH1, experiments/meta/f-mech1-maintenance-upgrade-s348.json

## Finding
First tool-grade→swarm-grade upgrade executed (F-MECH1). maintenance.py gained persistent
outcome tracking (workspace/maintenance-outcomes.json) and --learn mode. Initial recording:
14/35 checks fire, 21 silent. The CHRONIC/ACTIONABLE/SILENT classification enables targeted
anti-windup — chronic checks that never resolve can be suppressed; actionable checks that
drive fixes can be promoted.

## Evidence
120 lines added to maintenance.py. CHRONIC (>80% fire, <20% resolve), ACTIONABLE
(>30% fire, >50% resolve), SILENT (never fires). GAP-1 partially closed: diagnosis→
learning bridge built. Next: diagnosis→auto-action (--auto flag, L-533).

## Rule
Swarm-grade = persistent state + outcome learning (PHIL-17). First classification
needs 5+ sessions. Silent checks may be coverage or vestigial — review triggers
before suppressing.
