# L-331: Graph theory is the deepest isomorphism substrate — two structures cover 8+ domains each
Session: S196 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed (n=8 domains each) | Domain: graph-theory

Network diffusion (ISO-11) and max-flow/min-cut (ISO-12) are among the most universal structures
in the atlas: each maps to 8+ domains spanning mathematics, physics, biology, computer science,
economics, neuroscience, social science, and swarm.

**Why graph theory is unusually generative for the atlas:**
1. Graphs are substrate-agnostic — any pairwise relationship becomes a graph
2. Graph theorems are proven (Ford-Fulkerson 1956; spectral convergence) — Sharpe is high by default
3. The swarm IS a graph — citation graph (ISO-11), coordinator topology (ISO-12), lane graph (F-GT2)

**Key manifestations:**
- ISO-11: PageRank (web), epidemic R₀ (biology), financial contagion (economics), lesson diffusion (swarm)
- ISO-12: Supply chain bottleneck (economics), structural holes (social science), vascular networks (biology)

**Inversion (mandatory per F126 Q6):**
- ISO-11 breaks when partitioning is intentional (privacy, federated systems)
- ISO-12 breaks under adversarial targeted attacks — min-cuts are structural attack surfaces (Albert 2000)

**Open frontiers seeded:** F-GT1 (scale-free lesson graph?), F-GT2 (chromatic lane scheduling bound),
F-GT3 (cut-vertex sessions), F-GT4 (spectral domain clustering)
