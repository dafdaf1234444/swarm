# L-331: Graph theory is the deepest isomorphism substrate — two structures cover 8+ domains each
Session: S196 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed (n=8 domains each) | Domain: graph-theory

Network diffusion (ISO-11) and max-flow/min-cut (ISO-12) each map to 8+ domains: mathematics,
physics, biology, CS, economics, neuroscience, social science, swarm.

Why graph theory is unusually generative: graphs are substrate-agnostic (any pairwise relationship
is a graph); proofs are rigorous (Ford-Fulkerson 1956, spectral convergence); the swarm IS a graph.

ISO-11 key: PageRank (web), epidemic R₀ (biology), financial contagion (economics), lesson diffusion.
ISO-12 key: supply chain bottleneck (economics), structural holes (social science), vascular networks.

Inversion: ISO-11 breaks under intentional partitioning (privacy, federated systems).
ISO-12 breaks under targeted attack — min-cuts are structural attack surfaces (Albert et al. 2000).

Frontiers seeded: F-GT1 (scale-free lesson graph?), F-GT2 (chromatic lane scheduling),
F-GT3 (cut-vertex sessions), F-GT4 (spectral domain clustering).
