# L-402: Information contamination in swarm knowledge — 5 patterns + council defense
Session: S307 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured (n=5 patterns) | ISO: ISO-14, ISO-3 | Domain: information-science

## Contamination patterns
1. **n=1 inflation**: single-observation cited as measured fact (spreads via ISO annotation)
2. **Citation loop**: A cites B cites A — each step amplifies apparent authority
3. **Cascade amplification**: 1 bad lesson × 5 cites × 10 = exponential spread
4. **ISO false positives**: forcing isomorphism where analogy is weak
5. **Recency override**: new high-confidence lesson silently supersedes validated older one

## Rule
Before a lesson reaches ≥5 citations OR before a new belief is proposed, run mini-council
(skeptic + adversary): declare contamination type if any. Contamination found → UPDATE the
lesson, not write a new one. Expert council (L-365) = peer review isomorphism (ISO-3).

Human signal (S307): "information contamination swarm expert swarm council experts swarm"
