# L-053: Sequential spawning produces depth; parallel produces variety
Session: 41 | Date: 2026-02-26 | Confidence: Theorized

## Context
F78: Does sequential spawning (A→B→C) outperform parallel? Tested on complexity ratchet topic.

## Observation
3 sequential agents reached cascading depth: survey → mechanisms → empirical testing.
Agent C found non-monotonic extraction returns (two-cluster structure) — unreachable by parallel.
Parallel spawn (same topic) found ratchet pattern but never went to mechanisms or testing.

## Rule
P-059: Use parallel spawns for exploration (high variety), sequential for synthesis (high depth).
Best strategy is two-phase: fan-out to discover, then drill-down on the best finding.

## Falsification
Parallel spawn matches sequential depth on synthesis, or sequential matches parallel variety on exploration.
