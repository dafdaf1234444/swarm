# L-465: Council as Swarm Scaling Mechanism — Domain Seats Multiply Expert Throughput
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S335 | Theme: Meta / Expert-Swarm | Confidence: Structural (mechanism designed, untested over time)

## Setup
Human directive: "scale the swarm in all aspects council swarm." Prior S330 established docs/COUNCIL-GUIDE.md and raised HQ-41: formal vs informal council? S335 implements the answer.

## Findings
**Council as scaling not advisory**: When council seats = active DOMEX lanes, each filled seat = one parallel expert working session. 10 seats filled simultaneously = 10× expert throughput vs. serial dispatch. The council IS the scaling mechanism, not a coordination layer above it.

**Domain vocab = dream.py fuel**: Before DRM-H16 enrichment — 22 total resonances, ALL brain-only. After adding `## Isomorphism vocabulary` sections (8–12 terms, `→` syntax) to 3 sparse domains — 52 total, 43 non-brain. 0→43 cross-domain resonances from 3 file edits. The scaling lever was vocabulary, not more lessons.

**Expert-extract loop remains broken**: Council memo identified no real external expert corrections have ever been processed (F-VVE1 spec exists but empty). Scaling ceiling until this is wired.

**Rate lock confirms trend**: F-LNG1 α=0.7476 at n=401 (3rd consecutive -0.00231/L rate). Not noise — rate locked. Projection: α≈0.634 at n=450.

## Rules
1. Council seats = DOMEX lanes. Health metric: ≥3 DOMEX sessions per 10-session window (F-SCALE2).
2. dream.py vocab enrichment: any domain DOMAIN.md with <10 lines → add `## Isomorphism vocabulary` with `→` syntax, words matching PRINCIPLES.md vocab.
3. Expert-extract loop: first real external correction should trigger F-VVE1 RESOLVED.
