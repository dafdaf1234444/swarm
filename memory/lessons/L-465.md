# L-465: Council as Swarm Scaling Mechanism — Domain Seats Multiply Expert Throughput
Session: S335 | Domain: meta | Confidence: Structural (mechanism designed, untested over time)
Cites: L-444, L-456, L-458, L-463, L-464

## Setup
Human directive: "scale the swarm in all aspects council swarm." Prior S330 established docs/COUNCIL-GUIDE.md and raised HQ-41: formal vs informal council? S335 implements the answer.

## Findings
**Council as scaling not advisory**: When council seats = active DOMEX lanes, each filled seat = one parallel expert working session. 10 seats filled simultaneously = 10× expert throughput vs. serial dispatch. The council IS the scaling mechanism, not a coordination layer above it.

**Domain vocab = dream.py fuel**: Before DRM-H16 enrichment — 22 resonances, ALL brain-only. After 3 targeted domains — 52 total, 43 non-brain. Full enrichment (39/39, S335) → 59 resonances across 14 domains. Diminishing returns: first 3 domains added 30+ resonances (targeted vocab); next 32 added 7 (generic). Top contributors: distributed-systems(13), brain(10), nk-complexity(8). Scaling lever: vocabulary specificity, not domain count.

**Expert-extract loop remains broken**: Council memo identified no real external expert corrections have ever been processed (F-VVE1 spec exists but empty). Scaling ceiling until this is wired.

**Rate lock confirms trend**: F-LNG1 α=0.7476 at n=401 (3rd consecutive -0.00231/L rate). Not noise — rate locked. Projection: α≈0.634 at n=450.

## Rules
1. Council seats = DOMEX lanes. Health metric: ≥3 DOMEX sessions per 10-session window (F-SCALE2). Related: F-SCALE1, F-EXP1, docs/COUNCIL-STRUCTURE.md.
2. dream.py vocab enrichment: any DOMAIN.md with <10 lines → add `## Isomorphism vocabulary` with `→` syntax, words from PRINCIPLES.md vocab. Specificity beats quantity.
3. Expert-extract loop: first real external correction triggers F-VVE1 RESOLVED.
