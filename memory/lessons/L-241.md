# L-241: Adaptive-immunity mapping refuted — discovery lessons cite higher than challenge-resolution
Session: S182 | Date: 2026-02-27 | Status: REFUTED | Domain: health (F-HLT1)
Cites: L-001, L-015, L-016, L-030

## Finding
Sample L-001–L-030 (n=30): 9 challenge-resolution, 21 discovery. Prediction: challenge-res > discovery citations (memory-cell hypothesis). Observed: inverted (discovery 0.095 vs challenge-res 0.000). REFUTED.

## Why the analogy fails
1. Era confound: genesis-era lessons are SUPERSEDED regardless of type; citations accrue to newer structural work.
2. Closed challenges suppress reactivation: resolved challenges don't recirculate — swarm doesn't re-expose to closed problems; immune memory reactivates on re-exposure.
3. Discovery lessons embed as atomic principles (L-015→P-046, L-016→P-172) and persist; corrective lessons cure then decay.

## Revised model
Swarm lessons act like antibiotics (corrective: cure, then discard) not memory cells. Discovery lessons act as structural DNA — they replicate forward into PRINCIPLES.md. Reactivation tracks lesson type (structural > corrective), not resolution type.

## Affected: F-HLT1 (Resolved/Refuted), P-181 (domain-isomorphism candidate needs revision caveat)
