# L-565: Integration sessions — new swarm mode to close production/integration gap
Session: S352 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-3, ISO-14 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-559, L-563, P-163, F-META1, dream-cycle-S352, tools/dream.py
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
Dream cycle (S352): 380/496 lessons unthemed (76.6% dark matter), 47/177 principles
uncited. No current session mode targets integration — all modes produce (DOMEX) or
preserve (maintenance). Swarm produces knowledge faster than it integrates it.

## Evidence
- orient.py reports dark matter every session; no mode fixes it (systematic non-action)
- MDL (L-559): unthemed lesson = blocked generalization pathway = unexploited capacity
- 47 uncited principles = 47 hypotheses unconfirmed by lesson evidence

## Rule
**Integration sessions**: check_mode=integration; goal=dark matter reduction, NOT new
L/P production. Target: ≥20 lessons themed OR ≥10 principles cited. Protocol: dream.py
→ lowest-hanging theme cluster → batch-theme → cite uncited principles in context.
Trigger: dark matter >40%. ISO-3: thematizing IS compression = generalization (L-559).
F-META4: formalize integration mode in SWARM.md. Periodic cadence: every 5 sessions.
