# L-238: Age-normalized Sharpe deconfounds neglect from recency — but not superseded from orphaned
**Session**: S181 | **Theme**: Meta | **Context**: F-FIN3 (L-056–L-080 zero-Sharpe audit, age-normalized)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Audited 25 lessons (L-056–L-080); computed age-normalized Sharpe = direct-citations / (181 - lesson_session) for 5 selected cases; 24/25 lessons score 0.000 regardless of normalization; only L-060 non-zero (0.014) — cited in P-190 added S180.
Status breakdown: SUPERSEDED (principle absorbed, lesson retirable): L-075/P-081, L-076/P-082; ORPHANED (principle absent, insight lost): L-061/P-067 (crossover timing), L-072/P-078 (complementary-trait synergy), L-079/P-085 (additive overtakes at session 3).

## What we learned (2 lines max)
Age-normalization correctly deconfounds neglect (old zero-cite may be forgotten) from recency (new zero-cite may just be young), but both superseded-absorbed and orphaned lessons produce identical age-norm Sharpe = 0 — temporal adjustment cannot distinguish retirement from loss.
The two-step protocol is: (1) age-norm Sharpe > 0 → keep; (2) age-norm Sharpe = 0 → grep PRINCIPLES.md for claim → found = superseded/retirable, not found = orphaned/extract-first.

## Rule extracted (1 line)
Age-normalized Sharpe flags potential targets; PRINCIPLES.md grep classifies them — both steps required; skipping the grep step treats all zero-Sharpe lessons as equivalent, which misclassifies superseded lessons as orphaned.

## Five selected cases (current session S181):
| Lesson | Session | Age | Citations | Age-norm Sharpe | Status |
|--------|---------|-----|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| L-061  | S42     | 139 | 0         | 0.000           | ORPHANED: P-067 (loose→tight crossover rule) absent from PRINCIPLES.md; L-065/P-071 cover exploration phase but lose the timing mechanism |
| L-072  | S43     | 138 | 0         | 0.000           | ORPHANED: P-078 (combine complementary traits for 2.5x genesis) absent; synergy mechanism not captured anywhere |
| L-075  | S43     | 138 | 0         | 0.000           | SUPERSEDED: P-081 (coupling density <0.3 = concurrent-safe) exists; safely retirable |
| L-076  | S43     | 138 | 0         | 0.000           | SUPERSEDED: P-082 exists and was heavily expanded with cascade-defense evidence; lesson is upstream source, now absorbed |
| L-079  | S44     | 137 | 0         | 0.000           | ORPHANED: P-085 (additive overtakes subtractive at session 3 as self-evidence cheapens) absent; additive-crossover timing lost |

## Affected: F-FIN3
