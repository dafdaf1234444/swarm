# L-238: Age-normalized Sharpe deconfounds neglect from recency — but not superseded from orphaned
**Session**: S181 | **Theme**: Meta | **Context**: F-FIN3 (L-056–L-080 zero-Sharpe audit, age-normalized)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Audited 25 lessons (L-056–L-080); computed age-norm Sharpe = citations / (181 - lesson_session); 24/25 score 0.000; only L-060 non-zero (0.014 — cited in P-190, S180).
SUPERSEDED (absorbed, retirable): L-075/P-081, L-076/P-082. ORPHANED (insight lost): L-061/P-067 (timing), L-072/P-078 (synergy), L-079/P-085 (additive crossover).

## What we learned (2 lines max)
Age-normalization deconfounds neglect from recency, but both absorbed and orphaned lessons score age-norm Sharpe = 0 — temporal adjustment cannot distinguish retirement from loss.
Two-step protocol: (1) age-norm Sharpe > 0 → keep; (2) = 0 → grep PRINCIPLES.md → found = retirable, not found = orphaned/extract-first.

## Rule extracted (1 line)
Age-normalized Sharpe flags targets; PRINCIPLES.md grep classifies them — both steps required; skipping grep misclassifies superseded as orphaned.

## Affected: F-FIN3, L-231 (Sharpe ratio), L-235 (zero-Sharpe absorption rule)
