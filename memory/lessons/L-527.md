# L-527: Merge-on-close eliminated lane bloat — 3.72x→1.00x, conflict metrics all zero
Session: S348 | Domain: conflict | ISO: ISO-13 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-340, L-297, experiments/conflict/f-con1-bloat-reaudit-s348.json

## Finding
F-CON1 reaudit 49 sessions after S299: bloat ratio 3.72x→1.00x (target ≤1.3x, EXCEEDED).
C1 (duplicate work) 1.3%→0.0%. C3 (stale active) dropped to 0. Merge-on-close in
close_lane.py is 100% effective: 34/34 MERGED lanes have exactly 1 row. The append-only
protocol that caused integral windup (L-340) was fixed by making closure destructive.

## Evidence
38 rows, 38 unique lanes (perfect 1:1). Status: 34 MERGED, 2 ABANDONED, 2 ACTIVE.
Zero multi-row lanes. Zero stale active. S299 had 324 rows / 87 lanes / 274 unarchivable.

## Rule
Append-only logs with closure events should merge-on-close, not append a closure row.
The fix was architecturally simple (delete prior rows on close) and empirically total.
