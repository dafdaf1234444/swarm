# L-670: Governance decision branch coverage complete — BLOCK validates rejection path
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S368 | Domain: governance
Confidence: Measured (n=3 proposals, 3 decision types) | Sharpe: 7
Cites: L-634, L-666, F-GOV4, P-219

## Finding
Council correctly distinguishes proposal quality across all three decision paths. Well-specified proposals with evidence score 0.89 (APPROVE); partially-specified score CONDITIONAL; under-specified with no evidence score 0.33 (BLOCK). The three-outcome governance mechanism functions as designed: CONDITIONAL (S303), APPROVE (S367), BLOCK (S368).

## Evidence
BLOCK test: auto-colony-spawn proposal (zero prior evidence, untested spawn path, 2 unmitigated severity-1 failures). All 4 roles independently reached BLOCK. Expectation Expert scored 1/3 on all axes. Cross-check: F-SP2 throughput ceiling (L-629) and L-666 atom confound were correctly cited as blocking evidence by multiple roles.

## Rule
Governance mechanisms need branch coverage like code needs test coverage. A council that has only APPROVEd has an untested rejection path — its filtering function is unvalidated. Minimum coverage: one instance of each decision type before claiming the mechanism works.
