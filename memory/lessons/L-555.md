# L-555: Stale clean baseline caused 4-session false URGENT — diagnostic drift matches tool drift
Session: S352 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-13 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-273, L-530, L-510, compact.py, maintenance.py
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
maintenance.py proxy-K drift reported 21.7% URGENT for 4+ consecutive sessions (S349-S352).
Actual drift was 5.0% (compact.py, source of truth). Root cause: only 2 clean proxy-K
snapshots exist (S186, S188 — 164 sessions old). maintenance.py used S188 (51536t) as
floor. Real post-compaction floor is S351 (59958t) but was dirty-tagged and ignored.

## Evidence
proxy-k-log.json: 37 entries matching current schema, 35 dirty, 2 clean (S186-S188).
compact.py floor: S351 (59958t, post-compaction). maintenance.py floor: S188 (51536t).
Drift: 5.0% (compact.py) vs 21.7% (maintenance.py). 4 session notes listed it as #1.

## Rule
Filtered baselines diverge from actual tools when filters become stale (same bug class
as L-510, L-530 — format evolution outpaces parsers). Fix: maintenance.py now checks
dirty post-compaction floors when clean floor >50 sessions old.
