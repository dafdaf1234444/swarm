# L-023: Operational discipline is distinct from epistemic discipline
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: TASK-012 | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
The swarm had strong epistemic rules (honesty, falsification, adaptability) but zero operational infrastructure. Sessions could crash from context limits, had no continuation mechanism, no compaction, and no parallelism. An external review identified these five gaps.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Epistemic discipline (what to believe) and operational discipline (how to run) are orthogonal. Having one without the other creates a system that thinks well but dies between sessions. Five protocols — context, compaction, continuation, spawn, parallel agents — close the operational gap.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When building a persistent system, check both axes: does it reason correctly (epistemic) AND does it sustain itself operationally (lifecycle, handoff, scaling)? Never assume one implies the other.

## Affected beliefs: B2, B7
**ISO**: ISO-15 (specialization-generalization duality — operational discipline (what to do) vs epistemic discipline (what is true) = distinct specialization modes)
