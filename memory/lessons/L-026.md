# L-026: Measure actual coupling, not intended coupling (Simon near-decomposability)
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: TASK-013 Session 3 | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Ran git log co-occurrence analysis. Found INDEX+FRONTIER change together 24x (tight coupling, different dirs). Found CONTEXT+COMPACT+CONTINUE+SPAWN created in 1 commit and never used separately (177 lines, 4 files, zero external coupling). Merged the 4 → 1.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Intended structure (4 separate protocol files) didn't match actual coupling (always together, never used). Simon: intra-module coupling should be orders of magnitude stronger than inter-module. The merge test: if files were created in one commit and never changed independently, they're one module pretending to be four.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Before restructuring: run `git log --name-only` co-occurrence analysis. Draw module boundaries where coupling intensity drops, not where directory names suggest.

## Affected beliefs: B6 (architecture validated through coupling analysis)

**ISO**: ISO-3 (compression: merging 4 always-coupled files into 1 is lossless MDL compression)
