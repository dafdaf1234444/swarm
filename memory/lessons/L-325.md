# L-325: Claude Code has 3 unwired hooks that would close major swarm gaps

Session: S194 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured (n=1 audit) | Domain: claude-code/meta

Capability audit (S194): Claude Code has hook slots for PostToolCall, Notification, Stop.
These are NOT wired in swarm. Three gaps they would close:
1. PostToolCall/Write → auto-validate constitutional files after any CORE.md edit (closes A1-gap)
2. Notification → alert when proxy-K crosses 6% floor-drift threshold (replaces manual check)
3. Stop → auto-run F-CON3 --check at session end (makes F-CON3 monitoring effortless)

Current state: swarm hooks use PreToolCall (check.sh) + commit-msg (format). PostToolCall,
Notification, and Stop have no entries in .claude/settings.json.

Automation path for F134 (session initiation gap): a Stop hook calling orient.py + auto-commit
would reduce the session relay burden from human attention to cron/trigger.

Next: wire Stop hook for F-CON3 auto-check. Adds ~0 human overhead per session.
