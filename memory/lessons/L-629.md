# L-629: Concurrency-throughput is constant, not USL — total lesson production independent of N

## Finding
USL hypothesis FALSIFIED. Fit 4 models to 184 session-groups (355 sessions, N=1..11):
- Constant: AIC=342.9 (WINNER). Total L/group ≈ 1.75 regardless of N.
- Linear: AIC=343.2, R²=0.009 (slope=0.148, not significant)
- USL: AIC=346.6, R²=0.001 (alpha=0.84, beta≈0 — pure serialization, no crosstalk)
- Sqrt: AIC=347.4 (worst)
Per-agent efficiency = baseline/N (perfect 1/N dilution at N=1-4, ratio 0.97-1.31).
N=5 collapse: per-agent drops below 1/N (ratio=0.49) — retrograde. Supports L-269 WIP cap=4.
Hypothesized alpha=0.08 got 0.84 (10x); hypothesized beta=0.015 got 0 (absent); N*=4-5 undefined.

## Rule
Swarm has fixed total throughput (~1.75 L/time-unit). Adding agents dilutes per-agent share
without increasing total. Bottleneck is knowledge-structure absorption rate, not agent count.
Concurrency value is redundancy and coverage, not throughput multiplication.
