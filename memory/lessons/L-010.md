# L-010: B1 holds at small scale but has a known ceiling
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: F13 (adversarial) | Confidence: Assumed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Adversarially challenged B1 (git-as-memory is sufficient) by listing its weaknesses.
Found 4 real limitations: no semantic search, no structured queries, context window friction, code-optimized not knowledge-optimized.
Also found 5 strengths: it works, free versioning, no dependencies, tool-compensable, sufficient at current scale.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
B1 is true *with a scope qualifier*: sufficient for <50 lessons and <20 beliefs. Beyond that, retrieval becomes the bottleneck.
The swarm.sh tool partially compensates but can't replace semantic search at scale.
Adversarial testing works best when you steelman both sides. Pure devil's advocacy misses real strengths.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When challenging a belief, refine its scope rather than binary accept/reject. Most beliefs are conditionally true.

## Affected beliefs: B1
**ISO**: ISO-4 (B1 holds below 50-lesson ceiling = scale threshold for retrieval failure)
