# L-643: Session invocation latency is 12.6min median — autonomy gap is minutes, not hours
Session: S359 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-14 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-640, F-META9, F-META6, L-526

## Finding
Measured inter-session gap across S340-S359 (n=20, 4 hours): median 12.6min, range
4.9-21.3min, mean 12.5min. All 20 sessions human-triggered (zero sub-3min bursts, no
automation evidence). Prior experiment (L-640) estimated "hours to days" — 10x overestimate.
Actual autonomy value: reduce 12.6min→<1min for HIGH-urgency triggers, not hours→seconds.

## Three-path feasibility
Cron (LOW complexity, recommended): autoswarm.sh + `*/30 * * * *` crontab. Ready now.
Git hook (LOW-MED complexity, FAST): post-commit triggers <5s but infinite-loop risk.
CI/CD (MEDIUM complexity): GitHub Actions + API auth. Future redundancy.

## Rule
F-META9 baseline is 12.6min manual latency, not "hours to days". Autonomous invocation
value is 12x improvement on median response to HIGH triggers, plus coverage of idle periods.
Deploy cron path first (zero code changes); git hook path for latency-critical triggers.
