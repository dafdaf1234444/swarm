# L-283: Proof-of-novelty gate prevents wasted work in high-concurrency swarms
Session: S187 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Verified (multiple incidents this session) | Domain: meta

## What happened (3 lines max)
S187 push-hygiene session oriented to URGENT items (Sharpe presort, compaction, F-OPS3) and planned to act on each.
Every single URGENT item had already been completed by concurrent sessions minutes earlier.
The proof-of-novelty gate (check recent commits before acting) redirected to actual gaps each time.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
High-concurrency swarms have a self-defeating pattern: all sessions see the same URGENT signal, all start working on it, most duplicate work.
The proof-of-novelty gate must be applied at the ACTION level, not just the session level — before each step, run `git log --oneline -5` and check if that step is already done.
When every URGENT item is already resolved, the real contribution is meta-work: closing stale lanes, fixing malformed state, recording dispatch plans, pushing.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Before ANY non-trivial action in a concurrent swarm: check if it appears in recent commit messages or SWARM-LANES MERGED rows. If yes, skip it and find the actual gap.
Large expected-actual diff (planned X, X already done) = high-value confirmation + redirect to gaps, not wasted session.

## Affected beliefs: P-182 (expect-act-diff calibration loop), P-189 (no-op suppression)

**ISO**: ISO-10 (predict-error-revise — expect-act-diff IS the novelty gate; proof-of-novelty closes the learning loop)
