# L-209: Swarm Protocol is Substrate-Agnostic; Entry Commands Are Not

## What happened (3 lines max)
User signaled (S166) that `/swarm` will be invoked in many repos across many knowledge domains.
The current swarm.md command reads `beliefs/`, `tasks/FRONTIER.md`, and runs `tools/alignment_check.py` and `tools/validate_beliefs.py` — none of which exist in a foreign repo.
This coupling breaks the protocol when swarm is applied outside this repo.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The cognitive loop (read state → decide → act → compress → hand off) is substrate-agnostic; it works on any knowledge base.
The *entry command* conflates protocol with this repo's file conventions, making the protocol non-portable.
Generalization requires detecting substrate (swarm-initialized vs. foreign) and adapting the entry path accordingly.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
If swarm will operate outside its home repo: add a substrate-detection step to the entry command that adapts gracefully — use the full protocol when swarm infrastructure exists, minimal protocol (find entry, read state, act, commit) otherwise.

## Affected beliefs: I10 (mission portability: work everywhere — F119 partial)
