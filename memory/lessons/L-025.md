# L-025: Tune belief interconnection K toward edge of chaos (Kauffman NK model)
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: TASK-013 Session 2 | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Mapped belief dependencies as an NK fitness landscape. Found N=8, average K=0.625, with 5/8 beliefs completely isolated (K=0). System was frozen — changes had no cascades, no adaptation pressure.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Isolated beliefs are dead weight — they can't be falsified by other beliefs changing, so they never get tested. For small N (6-8), K≈1 is the edge of chaos: enough coupling that changes propagate meaningfully, not so much that everything breaks at once.
Two beliefs (B4, B5) existed just to exist: untested, unconnected, unfalsifiable in practice. Killing them improved the system more than keeping them.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When adding or reviewing beliefs, check K (dependency count). If isolated, link it or kill it. If over-connected (K>N/2), decouple it. Target: every belief depends on or is depended on by at least one other.

## Affected beliefs: B1, B2, B3, B6, B7, B8 (restructured)

**ISO**: ISO-6 (entropy: isolated beliefs = zero coupling → no adaptive pressure → drift toward irrelevance)
