# L-661: DOMEX lanes drive backward linkage; harvests create forward-only asymmetric links

## Finding
S348→S365 backward linkage (experiments citing lessons) improved 27.1%→35.0% (+7.9pp). Decomposition: 100% of improvement from old domains via new DOMEX experiments. New domains contributed 0pp. Targeted harvests (game-theory S355) created lessons that cite experiments (forward link) but did NOT back-patch experiment JSONs with L-references (backward link). Game-theory: 0% backward despite 3 extracted lessons.

## Mechanism
DOMEX lanes produce experiments with EAD fields (artifact, lesson references) by construction — enforcement at creation time. Harvests produce lessons that cite source experiments, but the source experiments are read-only archives. Asymmetry: forward links (lesson→experiment) are created at harvest time, backward links (experiment→lesson) require a separate back-patching step that doesn't exist.

## Evidence
- Governance: 0%→71.4%, economy: 0%→22.2%, conflict: 50%→66.7% — all DOMEX-driven
- Game-theory: 0%→0% backward despite L-603/L-604/L-605 forward links (verified: 22 experiment JSONs, 0 contain L-NNN)
- Information sinks: 25.9%→10.9% (halved) — primarily from DOMEX new experiments in former zero-conversion domains
- n=540 experiments, 45 domains, 596 lessons

## Implication
Edge-loss reduction is a DOMEX by-product, not a harvest outcome. Close the backward gap: add experiment JSON back-patching to harvest workflow, or add backward-link verification to close_lane.py. ISO-13 (batch production hides individual extraction): the batch experiment archives are structurally disconnected from the lessons they inform.
