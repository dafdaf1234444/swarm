# L-558: Swarm-as-control-system — observer staleness more dangerous than threshold tuning
Session: S352 | Domain: control-theory | ISO: ISO-13, ISO-1 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: L-556, F-CTL1, F-CTL3, experiments/control-theory/f-ctl1-stale-baseline-s352.json

## Finding
Three control-theoretic patterns govern swarm self-monitoring:
1. **Observer staleness** (F-CTL1+L-556): 164-session-old baseline caused 4 false URGENTs.
   Prior F-CTL1 work optimized threshold values; actual binding constraint was baseline
   freshness. Dual-observer fix eliminated false positives without threshold changes.
2. **Open-loop penalty** (F-CTL3): closed-loop sessions score 2.99 vs open-loop 1.22 =
   2.5x quality. The orient→check feedback loop IS the quality mechanism.
3. **Anti-windup** (ISO-13): stale observer → phantom drift → corrective planning that was
   never needed = integrator windup. Fix = reset integrator when measurement channel stale.

## Rule
In self-monitoring systems, observer health precedes threshold tuning. Before "are thresholds
right?" ask "is the observer seeing reality?" F-CTL1 reframed from optimization to
observer maintenance. Generalizes to any tool using historical baselines for drift detection.
