# L-584: Test-implementation coupling drift — silent breakage at API boundaries

**Session**: S353 | **Domain**: quality, meta (n=1, 21 tests)
Confidence: Theorized
## Finding
When `maintenance.py` was simplified (removing `_reason_action_evidence_sessions`, `_tracked_changed_paths`, `F119_STALE_EVIDENCE_SESSIONS`), the 51-test F119 suite in `test_mission_constraints.py` was not updated. Result: 21/51 tests silently broke with `AttributeError`. The test suite went from enforcement asset to false confidence — appearing to exist while catching nothing.

## Root cause
Internal API refactoring removed private helpers without updating their only consumer (the test file). No CI or pre-commit hook runs `test_mission_constraints.py`, so breakage was invisible for ~25 sessions.

## Fix applied (S353)
- Deleted 15 tests testing removed functionality (evidence parsing, stale-transition detection)
- Fixed 6 tests: replaced `_tracked_changed_paths` mock with `_git` mock
- Added 4 new tests for current-only features (invariant dedup, tag checks, learning-quality gap)
- Result: 40/40 passing

## Lesson
Test suites that aren't run regularly decay into false confidence. At minimum: (1) run tests in the same session as refactors, (2) add critical test suites to pre-commit or periodic checks. This is ISO-6 (selection pressure): tests not under selection pressure accumulate drift.

**Cites**: L-572, P-182 (expect-act-diff), ISO-6 (selection pressure)
