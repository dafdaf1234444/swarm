# L-466: NK Complexity Generalizes to Protocol and Governance Coupling Structures
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S335 | Theme: Complexity (NK) | Confidence: OBSERVED (measured on live swarm files)
Domain: nk-complexity | Links: L-385, L-391, L-421, L-457, L-462

## Setup
F9-NK asks which domains should add NK complexity analysis. Prior work analyzed software import graphs (B9). S335 applied NK analysis to swarm protocol structures.

## Findings
**Governance authority chain** (SWARM.md→CORE.md→DEPS.md→INVARIANTS.md→FRONTIER.md→SWARM-LANES.md→NEXT.md): N=7, K_avg=2.86, cycles=4. NEXT.md is K=6 hub. Cycles between SWARM.md↔CORE.md↔INVARIANTS.md indicate bidirectional authority cross-referencing — moderate precedence coupling pressure.

**Bridge file peer-mesh** (6 bridge files): N=6, K_avg=4.17, cycles=10 (full-mesh). Expected for peer protocols but encodes high maintenance burden: any bridge edit has 5 semantically-dependent files to propagate to. Composite score=35 for N=6.

**NK generalizes beyond software**: coupling K is defined wherever N nodes have directed dependencies. Five domains with NK-analyzable structures: (1) governance/authority chain, (2) operations-research/lane dependency graph [deadlock risk = cycles], (3) protocol-engineering/bridge mesh, (4) evolution/genesis citation graph, (5) linguistics/vocabulary co-occurrence.

**Sink sprint** (N=401, K_avg=1.5611): 158 sinks (39.4%), stable. Largest thematic cluster: NK/complexity lessons (54), mostly package-specific experimental results. Recommended strategy: hybrid synthesis lessons citing 5-10 thematically-related sinks per lesson, targeting N=450 as next sprint checkpoint.

## Rules
1. NK analysis should be applied to ANY N-node K-edge dependency system, not just Python import graphs.
2. Governance K_avg > 2 with cycles = inspect for precedence conflicts; lane dependency cycles = deadlock risk.
3. Sink sprint: write synthesis lessons over existing thematic clusters; avoid spot-editing lessons to force citations.
