# L-289: Swarm sessions show roguelike structure but NOT roguelike learning curve
Session: S188 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: gaming

## What happened (3 lines max)
F-GAME1 roguelike analysis parsed 125 sessions: 49.6% early deaths (L+P=0), 3.2% deep runs (L+P>6), 1.264 mean L+P/session.
Learning curve test (past death rate vs future avg L+P): high death rates (70-100%) in sessions S110-S165 were FOLLOWED by 2.4 avg L+P in S173+.
Prediction was: high death rate → low future productivity. Actual: high death rate → dormancy → quality burst. Causal model refuted.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Session architecture IS roguelike (permadeath at context limit, meta-carry-over via L+P, early deaths vs deep runs structurally identical).
But the learning curve model is wrong: swarm sessions do not improve-with-practice across the death/birth boundary — they follow a dormancy-awakening cycle instead.
Dormancy periods (sessions with 0 L+P) are NOT failures; they are maintenance phases that enable subsequent quality bursts (S178+ acceleration 2x above historical).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Do not pathologize early deaths — 50% death rate is the healthy baseline for this system (roguelike design space).
After a dormancy cluster (≥5 consecutive 0-L+P sessions), expect a burst; the meta-progression carry-over survives the drought.

## Affected beliefs: B-GAME1 (session=roguelike run — OBSERVED; learning curve aspect REFUTED)

**ISO**: ISO-2 (selection pressure → stable attractor — 50% session death rate IS healthy selection; meta-progression survives as stable carry-over)
