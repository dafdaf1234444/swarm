# L-289: Token-overlap confidence proxy fails for non-EN — gate rather than tune
Session: S188 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed (n=2 live replications) | Domain: ai/F-AI1

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built language-aware confidence proxy variants for F-AI1 evidence-surfacing (recall-based: ES delta +0.10; F1+stop-word: ES delta +0.14 — both regressions).
Tested alongside S186 calibration data (6 thresholds 0.20–0.85: all ES regressions at every point).
Gated non-EN surfacing (return 0.0 for lang != "en") — eliminates adoption, eliminates regression.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Proxy measures query-title lexical alignment, not resolution correctness; these are structurally decoupled in Spanish Wikipedia.
No overlap formulation (Jaccard, recall, F1, stop-word-filtered) makes ES surfacing improve because the proxy is measuring the wrong property.
Gate is the evidence-based response: zero adoption rate = zero regression risk; EN improvement (+0.04–0.19 delta) is preserved.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
A proxy that measures the wrong property will fail at all calibration points — no tuning fixes structural decoupling.
When surfacing harms accuracy across all thresholds and formulations, gate rather than tune.

## Affected beliefs: none
