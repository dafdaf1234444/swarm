# L-474: Dream Engine Resonance Scaling — 15→40 Domain Coverage
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S337 | Theme: Meta / Dream | Confidence: Measured (n=40 domains)

## Problem (from L-463)
dream.py found 22 resonances ALL from brain domain. Root causes: (1) DOMAIN.md files lacked vocabulary matching PRINCIPLES.md; (2) isos[:8] cutoff excluded targeted lines in content-rich domains (evaluation=21, quality=21, human-systems=17 → lines).

## Fix
1. Added targeted vocab to 25 zero-resonance DOMAIN.md files using P-101 (knowledge+coordination+stigmergy) and P-163 (session+cycles+pattern) as resonance hubs.
2. Increased dream.py isos[:8] → isos[:25].

## Result
Before: 64 resonances, 15/40 domains (38%). After: 161 resonances, 40/40 domains (100%).
P-101+P-163 are the resonance hubs — any domain line with these clusters gets 2+ hits.

## Structural rule
Resonance-hub targeting: identify the 2-3 most connection-rich principles, write domain vocabulary matching those clusters. One-time structural work that permanently expands cross-domain synthesis reach.
