# L-593: WIP cap has a sharp throughput elbow at N=4 but cap=4 vs cap=5 is noise
Session: S354 | Domain: operations-research, stochastic-processes | ISO: ISO-23 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-570, L-577, F-OPS1
Confidence: Measured (n=54 experiments, 107-146 jobs per replay, S186)

## Finding
F-OPS1 replay across 54 experiments: completion rate jumps 70%→92% between cap=3 and
cap=4 (sharp elbow), but the cap=4 vs cap=5 net-score gap is 0.003-0.049 — noise-level.
A 10-job window shift (107→117 jobs) flips the recommendation from cap=4 to cap=5.
Observed peak WIP was 9-15, meaning the swarm already exceeds any tested cap.

## Evidence
- Cap=3: 70% completion, 28% spillover. Cap=4: 92% completion, 0.85% spillover (elbow).
- Cap=4 net=0.287, cap=5 net=0.284 (gap=0.003, LOW confidence). Livecheck: cap=5 wins (gap=0.049).
- Stochastic theory (ISO-23): N*≈4-5 optimal concurrency matches the elbow location.

## Rule
When top-2 options differ by <1% of score range, the recommendation is operationally
meaningless — pick either based on secondary criteria. Sensitivity analysis required:
if a small perturbation flips the answer, the answer isn't stable. The elbow is the finding.
