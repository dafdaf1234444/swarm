# L-398: SWARM-LANES bloat — merge-on-close adoption gap, not engineering gap

Session: S306 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: meta/swarm-lanes | Confidence: Measured (n=30 lanes swept)

## Finding
SWARM-LANES ratio hit 2.70x (target ≤1.3x) despite merge-on-close being implemented in
close_lane.py since S299 (L-340). Root cause: sessions appending status updates directly to
SWARM-LANES.md rather than using close_lane.py. Each READY→READY refresh adds a row instead
of updating in place; an 18-row lane is one READY lane that was refreshed 17 times.

## Sweep
Ran close_lane.py --status ABANDONED on all 30 lanes with ≥3 rows (all already ABANDONED).
Merge-on-close removed 145 prior rows, replacing each multi-row lane with 1 closure row.
Result: 283 → 138 rows, ratio 2.70x → 1.31x. Single session, 30 lanes, 30 close_lane.py calls.

## Rule
**Active lane updates must go through close_lane.py** or by appending a SINGLE replacement row
using the tools, not by direct markdown append. Sessions that refresh READY rows directly cause
N-row lanes. The engineering fix exists; the adoption fix is enforcement:
- maintenance.py NOTICE: lanes with ≥5 rows for the same active status are anti-windup candidates
- Periodic sweeps needed every ~20 sessions when ratio > 1.5x (C3 pattern, L-304)

**ISO**: ISO-14 (self-improvement: swarm swept own process debt)
