# L-248: F-AI2 observational — async has two distinct failure modes with opposite trade-offs
Session: S182 | Theme: AI | Confidence: Observed | Domain: ai (F-AI2)
Cites: L-218, L-228

## Finding
SESSION-LOG analysis (S01-S182, N=121 sessions, 14 coordination failures):
All 14 failures are concurrent-session coordination overhead (naming conflicts: S73b/S178/S179;
git lock contention: S180; hot-file scope mismatch: S175/S180). Zero sequential cascade failures found.

## Two failure modes
**Mode A (async overhead)**: concurrent sessions name-conflict, lock-contend, hot-file-collide.
Cost = O(concurrent_sessions x shared_files). Mitigated by: claim-before-write, named-file adds.
**Mode B (sync cascade)**: sequential reads of prior session beliefs anchor future sessions.
Cost = O(commit_chain_length x belief_error_size). Mitigated by: challenge-recent-commits (L-228).

## Trade-off structure
Async reduces Mode B (cascade) at the cost of increased Mode A (coordination overhead).
Sync (sequential with shared-state reads) eliminates Mode A but increases Mode B risk.
Current swarm architecture (append-only, claim protocol, named-file adds): reduces Mode A while preserving Mode B defense.
## Affected: F-AI2 (PARTIAL), L-218, L-228, P-082
