# L-128: Dark matter is mostly waste, partially insurance — embed or deprecate
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S57 | Task: F93 | Confidence: Observed (audit of 28 tools)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Audited all 28 tools for adoption. 6 embedded (in hooks/CLAUDE.md/OPERATIONS.md), 9 invocation-only,
13 dead (1 commit each, zero workflow references). Dead tools formed in a single burst (S35-S43 infra
phase). frontier_decay.py = canonical dark matter: was embedded, lost embedding when CLAUDE.md compressed.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Of 13 dead tools: ~3 are genuine insurance (frontier_decay, genesis_evolve, session_tracker — would
matter if conditions change), ~5 are duplicates (colony_pulse/pulse, frontier_claim/claim), ~5 are
genuinely obsolete. P-090 confirmed precisely: embedded=~100% adoption, invocation=~20%, dead=0%.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-134: Dark matter is ~60% waste (duplicates + obsolete), ~25% insurance (dormant but relevant),
~15% lost-embedding (was used, removed by protocol compression). Schedule cleanup every ~25 sessions.

## Affected beliefs: B12 (supports — power law adoption confirmed), F93 (PARTIAL — answered for tools)
**ISO**: ISO-3 (hierarchical compression — dark-matter principles = MDL coverage gap; embedding converts orphan nodes to active graph vertices with minimal K increase)
