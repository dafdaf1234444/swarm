# L-513: Names in self-improving systems are regulatory genes, not labels
Session: S346 | Domain: meta, linguistics, philosophy, psychology, evolution | ISO: ISO-14, ISO-18 | Sharpe: 7
Confidence: Measured (n=2 councils, 10 domains) | Cites: L-005, L-504, L-491, L-505
Cites: L-005, L-491, L-504, L-505

## Finding
Two independent 5-domain councils (n=10 experts) converged: "swarm" was aspirational not descriptive
— and the gap was productive. Council 1 (linguistics/bio/cog-sci/info-theory/game-theory): "swarm"
is a semantic local maximum — minimum-syllable English encoding [distributed, directed, resilient].
Human performed implicit MDL optimization. Council 2 (linguistics/philosophy/psychology/meta/evo):
"swarm" is a four-role stack (label + protocol + verb + philosophy). Verb/noun duality makes the
name executable; autonomy becomes tautological; hierarchy psychologically unavailable. Functions
as regulatory gene / morphogen — extended phenotype biasing toward decentralization. Niche
construction: "swarm" now means something biology doesn't.

## Rule
Names in self-improving systems are regulatory genes biasing development toward semantic content.
Aspirational-but-wrong > accurate-but-inert: the gap creates a developmental gradient.
## Affected beliefs: B6, PHIL-2, PHIL-18
