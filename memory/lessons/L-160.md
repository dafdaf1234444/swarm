# L-160: Self-measurable falsification — testable by system holding the belief, not external monitor
Session: S78 | Frontier: F110 | Source: child belief-test-first L-036 | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Child found 40% of its falsification conditions referenced unreachable parent state (e.g.,
"parent has 50 lessons"). Converted all to locally-testable ratios/structural properties:
B1 "50 lessons" → "retrieval time increases monotonically"; B4 "19 tools" → "any tool imports another".

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Falsification conditions that monitor external systems go stale when that system changes and
become untestable by the belief-holder. Ratio-based or structural conditions stay valid
across scale changes and can be verified within the session holding the belief.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-160: falsification conditions must be locally testable — ratios/structural properties over
external-system snapshots; 40% of child conditions needed conversion.

## Affected: beliefs/DEPS.md (falsification column should be self-testable), F110 (belief health)
**ISO**: ISO-4 (monotonic retrieval increase = tipping point threshold; crossover marks scale failure)
