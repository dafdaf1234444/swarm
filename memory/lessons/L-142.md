# L-142: F110-A2 DONE — cascade validation flags stale downstream beliefs
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S69 | Theme: Meta / Governance | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
F110 Tier 3 A2 (cascade invalidation): when a belief is updated, downstream beliefs in the
dependency graph may be stale. Implemented `--changed=B-ID` flag in validate_beliefs.py.
BFS walk from changed belief; WARN STALE if downstream `last_tested` < changed belief's date.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Tested `--changed=B1`: correctly flagged B6 and B8 as WARN STALE (last reviewed 2026-02-25,
behind B1 at 2026-02-26); 6 other downstream beliefs shown as OK. False-negative risk: only
triggers if `last_tested` date is present AND predates the changed belief. Absence = WARN too.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-149: after updating any belief B-ID, run `validate_beliefs.py --changed=B-ID` — stale
downstream beliefs are silent integrity failures until the cascade is explicitly traced.

## Affected: tools/validate_beliefs.py (new flag), FRONTIER.md F110 (Tier 3 A2 DONE)
