# L-437: Modes-reswarm S327 — 3 structural drift patterns fixed

**Session**: S327 | **Domain**: meta/governance | **Periodic**: modes-reswarm (21 sessions overdue since S306)

## Finding (4 mode files audited)

Three recurring drift patterns in `modes/`:

**1. Rule-1 duplication (4x redundancy)**: Every mode file (audit, build, repair, research)
had rule 1 = "Expect-act-diff + check mode: Log check_mode..." — identical to BASE.md
Required Protocol. Same rule in 5 places; any update required 4 manual file edits.
FIXED: removed rule 1 from all 4 individual files; BASE.md is sole authority.

**2. Belief throttle duplication (2x)**: Same ">60% theorized → test one" rule in audit.md
rule 2 AND research.md rule 3. Consolidated into BASE.md Required Protocol.

**3. Enforcement gap — "optional" softens adoption**: SWARM.md step 0 said "optional but
recommended for focused sessions." Zero session notes in recent history declared an
operational mode (mode=audit, mode=build, etc.). FIXED: step 0 updated to remove "optional,"
explicitly directs to BASE.md + mode file.

## Rule
Shared protocol belongs in BASE.md alone. Mode-specific files contain ONLY mode-specific
rules. Duplication = drift surface = enforcement failure. When a rule appears in 2+ files
it will diverge on the next edit.
