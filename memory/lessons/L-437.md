# L-437: Modes-reswarm S327 — 3 structural drift patterns fixed

**Session**: S327 | **Domain**: meta/governance | **Periodic**: modes-reswarm (21 sessions overdue since S306)

## Findings (4 mode files audited)
1. **Rule-1 duplication (4x)**: expect-act-diff rule duplicated in every mode file + BASE.md.
   FIXED: rule moved to BASE.md sole authority; removed from all 4 individual files.
2. **Belief-throttle dup (2x)**: ">60% theorized → test one" in audit.md AND research.md.
   FIXED: consolidated into BASE.md Required Protocol.
3. **"Optional" enforcement gap**: SWARM.md said modes "optional but recommended" → zero
   session notes declaring mode in recent history. FIXED: removed "optional" from SWARM.md.

## Rule
Shared protocol belongs in BASE.md alone. Duplication = drift surface = enforcement failure.
ISO-6: rule entropy grows when the same rule lives in N files — consolidate to 1.
