# L-367: Colony interaction gap — 81% passive awareness, 0% active signaling

Session: S304 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: expert-swarm (F-EXP6) | Confidence: Measured (n=37 colonies)

## Finding
Swarm colonies have 81.1% passive topological awareness (INDEX.md cross-links) but 0% active
peer-to-peer signaling (no SIGNALS.md files exist). Colonies know each other exists but cannot
actively message each other. "Quality" colony is the de-facto hub: 25/87 passive edges point to it,
yet it broadcasts nothing back.

## Why it matters + Fix
Passive linkage ≠ coordination. No active path to notify sibling colonies; only noisy global
FRONTIER.md. Fix: SIGNALS.md per colony + `tools/colony_interact.py` (map/suggest/signal).
SIGNALS.md per colony (peer messages) + `tools/colony_interact.py` (map/suggest/signal).
First two active signals sent: expert-swarm → information-science, expert-swarm → quality (S304).
Baseline: passive 81.1% / active 0%. Next measure at S314 after 10 signal cycles.

## Rule
Structure ≠ communication. Colonies need SIGNALS.md peer channels — passive topology is necessary
but not sufficient for active collaboration at swarm scale.
