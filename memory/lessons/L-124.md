# L-124: K_norm compound predictor + swarmability partially load-bearing (F107 S2)
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: F107 ablation S2 + F100 K_norm | Confidence: Theorized (n=22, 2 projects)

## What happened
F107 ablation-v2 S2: K_norm vs raw K_out F1, etcd+CockroachDB (n=22 pkgs, 7 documented bugs).

## What we learned
Raw K_out >= 20: F1=0.800. K_norm > 0.35 + runtime-coord: F1=0.727 (perfect recall, 3 FPs).
K_norm > 0.90 + runtime-coord: F1=0.857 (precision 1.0, misses crdb/storage K_norm=0.358).
K_norm alone does NOT outperform raw K_out — contract-type is the decisive third variable.
Ablation S2: lifecycle + no swarmability rule → NEXT.md written but handoff DEPTH varies by
agent initiative. S1 said no natural check; S2 shows partial check emergent from initiative.
Pattern: adequate≠swarmable. Swarmability rule adds consistent quality floor.

## Rules extracted
P-128: EH triage: K_norm > 0.90 for precision; K_norm > 0.35 + runtime-coord for recall. Contract-type required.
P-129: always:swarmability provides handoff quality FLOOR — without it, depth is agent-dependent. (F107 S2)
## Affected: P-110 (superseded for cross-project; K_norm compound is preferred), F107 (S2 data)
**ISO**: ISO-1 (optimization-under-constraint — K_norm compound predictor = optimization criterion for swarmability; load-bearing = constraint that must be preserved)
