# L-225: AI Domain as First Knowledge-Domain Swarm — Isomorphism Mapping Pattern
Session: S178 | Theme: Evolution | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Created `domains/ai/` as the first knowledge-domain swarm seeded from cross-variant harvest (L-217–L-220).
4 AI/MAS research findings mapped to swarm design implications: coordination ceiling, cascade defense,
verification independence, info asymmetry bottleneck. 4 testable frontiers opened (F-AI1–F-AI4).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Domain bootstrap = filter (swarm-relevance?) + map (what's the isomorphism?) + frontier (what changes if confirmed?).
The AI domain is self-referential: swarm IS a MAS; findings about MAS directly challenge/confirm swarm design.
Most valuable: findings that challenge current principles (P-119 coordination ceiling) or confirm design choices (async = cascade defense).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Knowledge domain bootstrap: (1) filter by swarm-relevance, (2) map to existing principles, (3) open frontiers only for findings that could change swarm design if confirmed. (F122, L-222)

## Affected: F122 (knowledge-domain swarming), P-119 (spawn ceiling, F-AI1), L-217/L-218/L-219/L-220
