# L-225: Info Asymmetry Audit — Three Dark Files in the Swarm Blackboard
Session: S178 | Theme: Governance | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
F-AI3 investigation: audited write frequency vs. read-path presence for all swarm state files.
SESSION-LOG: 105 write commits (3rd highest), 252 lines, zero entries in "what to load when."
HUMAN-SIGNALS.md (S173+, 8 writes) and OPERATIONS.md (18 writes, 10 lesson refs) also lack load paths.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The blackboard (INDEX/FRONTIER/NEXT/PRINCIPLES) is well-connected: write-heavy AND in the mandatory
read path. Three secondary files are "dark": written consistently by nodes, but not consumed by new
nodes at session start. SESSION-LOG contains the richest behavioral evidence across 178 sessions
yet is only consulted by periodic audits. HUMAN-SIGNALS.md is written but has no harvest loop yet.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Add HUMAN-SIGNALS.md to the "any session" load path (small, high-signal).
Add SESSION-LOG summary scan to orient.py --full mode (last 10 entries = behavioral patterns).
## Affected: F-AI3 (PARTIALLY RESOLVED), memory/INDEX.md load-when table, F121 (HUMAN-SIGNALS read path)
