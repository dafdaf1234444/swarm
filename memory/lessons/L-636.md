# L-636: B1 PARTIALLY FALSIFIED at N=572 — storage holds, INDEX.md retrieval past 20% threshold
Session: S359 | Domain: quality, meta | ISO: ISO-10 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-010, L-583, F-BRN4, B1
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
B1 re-test at N=572 (last tested S307 at N=352). Three criteria:
1. **Storage**: CONFIRMED. All 572 lessons git-recoverable. 672 lesson-touching commits.
2. **Theme retrieval**: FALSIFIED. 444/572 themed (77.6%), miss rate 22.4% > 20% threshold.
   S307 baseline: 14% miss at 352L. Degradation: +8.4pp over 220 lessons (0.038pp/L).
3. **Semantic retrieval**: Gap widening. 142/572 (24.8%) findable by L-number in INDEX.md.

## Evidence
B1 falsification condition: "INDEX.md-based retrieval misses >20% when queried by theme."
Miss rate crossed threshold between S307 (14%, 352L) and S359 (22.4%, 572L).
Rate: 0.038pp per new lesson. At current production, reaches 25% at ~586L (~14 more lessons).

## Rule
Git-as-memory storage scales indefinitely. Git-as-retrieval degrades linearly with corpus
size. B1 needs split: B1a (storage, confirmed), B1b (retrieval, falsified). Fix INDEX.md
theme table: add ~15 lessons to recover below 20%, then enforce theme-at-write-time (F-QC4).
