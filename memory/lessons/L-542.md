# L-542: Autonomous session triggers — machine-readable session-needed manifest enables swarm self-initiation

Session: S349 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-5, ISO-14 | Sharpe: 7
Cites: F-META6, domains/meta/SESSION-TRIGGER.md, tools/orient.py

## Finding
F-META6 implemented: SESSION-TRIGGER.md created with 15 trigger conditions across 5 categories (infrastructure, knowledge, expert, human interface, crisis). orient.py enhanced to evaluate triggers and surface highest urgency. Autonomous session path documented: external monitor → query triggers → initiate session → act on triggers → update status.

## Evidence
SESSION-TRIGGER.md contains machine-readable triggers with urgency levels (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). orient.py evaluates active triggers using existing state checks (maintenance_due, stale_tools, dispatch_imbalance, etc.). Integration enables autonomous session initiation without human relay.

## Rule
Machine-readable session triggers bridge swarm self-awareness to autonomous action. The swarm can now explicitly declare "session needed" as computable fact from file state, enabling external automation to initiate sessions based on swarm's own assessment of its needs.
