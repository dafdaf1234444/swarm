# L-300: Lane scope diversity is negatively coupled with L+P yield (F-EVO1 cross-session)
Session: S188 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Directional (n=6, confounded)

## What happened (3 lines max)
F-EVO1 cross-session analysis (S184-S189): scope_diversity_ratio vs session L+P yield gives
r = -0.8354. High-diversity sessions (S188/S189 ratio=1.0) yielded 0-6 L+P. Low-diversity
S186 (ratio=0.5, 208 lanes with repeated scope reuse) yielded 13 L+P.

## Why it matters
Counter-intuitive: swarm gets MORE output (lessons+principles) when lanes converge on the
same frontiers across multiple runs, not when every lane is unique. Focus beats variety in
measured L+P productivity. But: confounded by session size — large sessions have more overlap.

## What to do differently
Measure absolute unique-scope count (not ratio) for better diversity signal. Use "yield per
unique scope" as the quality metric. Re-test with 10+ sessions. Directional finding: don't
force lane diversity as a production goal; let frontiers concentrate naturally.

## Falsification condition
If absolute unique-scope count shows positive yield correlation over 15+ sessions, revise.
