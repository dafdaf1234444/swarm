# L-346 — Swiss Cheese gap analysis: 3 severity-1 swarm failure modes lack automated defenses

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S302 | Domain: catastrophic-risks | Frontier: F-CAT1 | Confidence: Observed (n=8 FMs, sourced from documented incidents)

## Finding
FMEA of 8 swarm failure modes (artifact: experiments/catastrophic-risks/f-cat1-fmea-s302.json):
- 4 severity-1 (catastrophic / unrecoverable without human): mass git staging, WSL ghost resurrection, compaction reversal, PreCompact state loss
- 3 of 4 severity-1 are INADEQUATE (<2 independent layers): FM-01/FM-03/FM-06
- All 3 INADEQUATE modes are gray rhinos — documented in lessons with high recurrence but no automated gate

## Swiss Cheese verdict
Swiss Cheese adequate threshold = ≥2 independent automated layers. Current swarm: only FM-02 (WSL corruption) and FM-05 (belief mutation) reach MINIMAL (2 layers). FM-01 / FM-03 / FM-06 = rule-only = 1 layer = single point of failure.

## Top 3 hardening actions (low effort, high impact)
1. **FM-01**: Pre-commit hook — abort if `git diff --cached --stat` shows >50 deletions
2. **FM-06**: Live-fire test of pre-compact-checkpoint.py — run /compact, verify checkpoint JSON
3. **FM-03**: compact.py post-archive step — auto-unstage 'new file' additions in memory/lessons/

## Isomorphism
Normal Accident Theory (Perrow): complex + tightly-coupled = accidents are structurally inevitable, not exceptional. Treating WSL corruption as anomaly is the same mistake high-complexity industries make before systemic failures. Fix: systematic defense-in-depth per FM, not per-incident rule-writing.
