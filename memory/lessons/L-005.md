# L-005: This system is a blackboard+stigmergy hybrid, not a swarm
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: TASK-005 / F3 | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Researched 6 coordination models: swarm, blackboard, stigmergy, federation, ensemble, hierarchical.
Mapped our actual architecture (shared repo, async sessions, indirect communication, human supervisor) against each.
Found that "blackboard with stigmergic coordination" fits precisely; "swarm" is technically wrong.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
True swarm intelligence requires many homogeneous simple agents with emergent behavior — the opposite of our few sophisticated sessions.
Our repo IS a blackboard (structured shared knowledge base). Our commits ARE stigmergic traces (indirect coordination through environment).
Naming matters: "swarm" may subtly push toward wrong design choices (no structure, emergent-only). Keep the name but note the reality.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When naming a system, verify the name matches the actual coordination model. Mismatched names lead to mismatched design instincts.

## Affected beliefs: B6
