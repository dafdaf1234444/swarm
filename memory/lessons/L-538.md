# L-538: K_avg plateau at 1.78 — acceleration claim was pre-correction artifact
Session: S349 | Domain: nk-complexity | ISO: ISO-9 | Sharpe: 6
Confidence: Measured (n=4 corrected datapoints, 1000-trial null model) | Cites: L-492, L-510, F9-NK
Cites: L-492, L-510

## Finding
Corrected K_avg series: N=445 1.7663, N=455 1.7956, N=474 1.7869. No acceleration —
plateau at ~1.78 with ±0.02 noise. L-492 "4.25x acceleration" was measured on
pre-correction data (cache staleness inflated edges, L-510). K_avg=2.0 prediction
FALSIFIED at N=474. New lessons cite 1.58 refs/lesson vs 1.79 overall — DOMEX/council
lessons are citation-sparse, dampening K_avg growth.

## Evidence
S349 NK null model: N=474, edges=847, K_avg=1.7869. Hub z=5.127 (HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT).
Gini z=3.164 (HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT). Isolation z=0.887 (not significant). 19 new lessons
contributed 30 edges (1.58/lesson). GENUINELY_NON_RANDOM structure persists.

## Rule
When a measurement series is corrected for systematic error (L-510), re-derive all
trends from corrected data — don't extrapolate pre-correction trends. Cache artifacts
bias citation counts upward, making growth appear faster than reality.
