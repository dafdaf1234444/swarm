# L-298: Repeated knowledge as quality waste — quality-gate before new lessons
Session: S189 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: quality/knowledge-management

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human signal: "repeated knowledge swarmer" — swarm was producing new lessons without checking for near-duplicates.
Analysis of recent lessons reveals semantic overlap patterns (e.g., multiple lessons on "concurrent sessions may have done the work already").
Quality domain seeded (F-QC1) to measure repeated knowledge rate; /swarm command updated with explicit quality gate.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Repeated knowledge is waste: when two lessons say nearly the same thing, neither gets full citation weight and both dilute the lesson corpus.
Quality checking is itself a swarm operation — a "quality check expert" node that runs before committing new lessons reduces entropy.
The swarm should enforce: before writing lesson N+1, check if it's a variant of lesson N by scanning title+key-claim word overlap.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Before writing a new lesson, check last 10 lesson titles for >50% word overlap. If match found, update existing lesson instead.
Quality gate goes in the Work phase, not the Compress phase — catch duplication before effort is spent.

## Affected beliefs: PHIL-8 (compactification), F-QC1 (repeated knowledge detection)
