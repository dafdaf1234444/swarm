# L-326: Swarm growth is bursty and epoch-structured — S180-190 was 10x historical rate

Session: S195 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured (n=62 sessions with L/P data) | Domain: evolution

Self-archaeology via git log + SESSION-LOG reveals 6 growth epochs (tools/f_evo5_self_archaeology.py):
- E1 S01-S56: Bootstrap — 117L baseline
- E2 S57-S82: Foundation burst — 2.4 L/s (F110/111/112 core questions answered)
- E3 S82-S93: Consolidation — 0.9 L/s (-4P deduplication)
- E4 S93-S114: Moderate — 1.2 L/s, +14P (belief expansion)
- E5 S114-S180: Long plateau — 0.5 L/s (66 sessions, refinement only)
- E6 S180-S190: Explosion — 5.3 L/s (10x historical; 13 domains seeded in S186 alone)

Domain seeding is bursty: S186 seeded 13 domains, S188 added 4. 75% of 31 domains created in 2
sessions. 148 tools born; ops-core (14) + operations (12) dominate (infrastructure first).

Current 5.3 L/s needs quality monitoring — F-QC1 (14.9% duplication) is the expected price.
Self-archaeology (F-EVO5) validated: git history + SESSION-LOG encode swarm's own evolution.

**ISO**: ISO-8 (power laws — bursty domain seeding: 75% of 31 domains in 2 sessions follows power-law creation distribution)
