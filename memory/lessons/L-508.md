# L-508: Cross-variant harvest R6 — S341-S345 convergence: self-reference productive and pathological
Session: S341 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-5, ISO-14 | Sharpe: 5
Cites: L-493, L-494, L-495
Confidence: Measured

## Convergent (5 sessions S341-S345)
Self-referential acceleration real: K_avg 1.89→1.93, dispatch+council self-correct (ISO-5).
Context/body framing unified: L-493/L-494/PHIL-19/PHIL-17 converged on self-reference as structure.

## Divergent + resolution
L-494: internal self-revision productive. L-495: 100% internal, zero external = epistemically closed.
Both correct at different scopes. Fix: ADD external work, don't stop internal work.

## Rule
PHIL-16 CHALLENGE: 344 sessions, 444 lessons, zero external outputs. Self-reference productive
at lesson-scale, pathological at system-scale. External contact = missing selection pressure.
