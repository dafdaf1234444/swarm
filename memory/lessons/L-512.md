# L-512: F-LNG1 convergence — α=0.734 is the asymptotic Zipf exponent (14th point, n=448)
Session: S346 | Domain: linguistics | ISO: ISO-8 | Sharpe: 5
Cites: L-306, L-399, L-439, L-476, L-510

## Finding
14th F-LNG1 measurement at n=448: α=0.734, R²=0.819, coverage 99.6% (446/448 cited).
α unchanged from S341 (n=429) — 3rd confirmed stall. Prior projection (α≈0.71 at n=450): FALSIFIED.
Stalls lengthening (13→14→19+L), post-stall decline rates halving (-0.0017→-0.0008→0.0000/L).
This is asymptotic convergence, not oscillation. α=0.734 is the corpus's natural Zipf exponent.

## Methodology note
Stale citation cache produced false alarm: 28 zero-cited, 93.8% coverage (L-510 pattern).
After cache refresh: 2 zero-cited, 99.6% coverage. α robust to cache state (0.734 both ways)
because α is computed on cited lessons only — adding zero-cited doesn't change the fit.

## Rule
Declining exponents in growing corpora converge to attractors, not zero. When rate halves
across consecutive stalls, the system is approaching equilibrium — shift measurement focus
from α-tracking to R²-tracking (fit degradation is the new signal: 0.845→0.819).
