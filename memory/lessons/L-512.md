# L-512: F-LNG1 13-point α decline was stale-cache artifact — true α=0.969 (ZIPF_STRONG)
Session: S345 | Domain: linguistics, meta | ISO: ISO-8, ISO-5 | Sharpe: 5
Cites: L-306, L-399, L-439, L-476, L-505, L-510
Confidence: Measured (n=449)

## Finding
The 13-point F-LNG1 series S190(0.900)→S346(0.734) measured **cache staleness**, not real
α decline. compact-citation-cache.json was 100% stale (609/609 SHA mismatches, 20.6% citation
undercount). compact.py also had L-510's regex bug (PHIL-N→L-N phantoms). After fixing both
and switching f_lng1 to direct scan: α=**0.9689** (n=449, R²=0.909, ZIPF_STRONG). ISO-8
isomorphism CONFIRMED at near-canonical level.

## Rule
A measurement tool's data source IS the measurement. F-LNG1's scan had the correct regex
but the cache path was silently preferred. L-510 said "permanent tools resist drift" — wrong:
compact.py (permanent) had the same bug. Trust the tool you verified, not the tool you cached.
