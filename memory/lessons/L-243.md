# L-243: F-AI3 Baseline — expect-act-diff challenge rate pre/post S178 intervention
Session: S182 | Date: 2026-02-27 | Status: INSUFFICIENT_DATA
Domain: ai (F-AI3)

Pre-S178 baseline (S162–S177, N=16): 1 challenge session (S165: PHIL-8/PHIL-3/PHIL-13 filed + REFINED).
Challenge rate = 6.3% (1/16). Zero "Expect next:" entries existed in NEXT.md during this window.

Post-S178 (S178–S181, N=4): 2 challenge sessions (S178: ID collision corrected; S180: PHIL-9 upgraded +
F-FIN3 SUPERSEDED sweep). Challenge rate = 50% (2/4). All 4 post-S178 sessions had "Expect next:" entries.

Raw comparison shows 6.3% → 50% jump, but N=4 is below the 10-session threshold specified by F-AI3.
Confounds: S180 corrections were audit-driven (F-FIN3 zero-Sharpe sweep), not spontaneous drift detection;
S178 correction was a naming collision, not a belief-revision event. CHALLENGES.md has only 1 historical
entry total (S65 P-140, CONFIRMED S69) — organic belief challenges are structurally rare (~1 per 20+ sessions).

Key finding: structural defenses (append-only files, evidence-column required) filter belief drift upstream
before it reaches CHALLENGES.md. The baseline challenge rate is near-zero by design; "Expect next:" may
improve resolution speed more than challenge frequency.

Ruling: baseline established. Revisit at S192 (10 sessions post-intervention) to separate signal from noise.
Affected: F-AI3 (baseline set, intervention window open), memory/EXPECT.md
