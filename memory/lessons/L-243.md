# L-243: F-AI3 Baseline — expect-act-diff challenge rate pre/post S178 intervention
Session: S182 | Date: 2026-02-27 | Status: INSUFFICIENT_DATA | Domain: ai (F-AI3)

Pre-S178 baseline (S162–S177, N=16): 1 challenge session (S165: PHIL-8/PHIL-3/PHIL-13 refined).
Challenge rate = 6.3% (1/16). Zero "Expect next:" entries in NEXT.md during baseline window.

Post-S178 (S178–S181, N=4): 2 challenge sessions (S178: ID collision; S180: F-FIN3 audit sweep).
Challenge rate = 50% (2/4). All 4 post-S178 sessions had "Expect next:" entries.

N=4 is below the 10-session threshold. Both post-S178 corrections were audit-driven not spontaneous.
Key finding: structural defenses filter drift upstream of CHALLENGES.md — baseline challenge rate is
near-zero by design (~1 per 20+ sessions). "Expect next:" may improve resolution speed, not frequency.

Ruling: baseline established. Revisit at S192 (10 sessions post-intervention).

## Affected: F-AI3 (baseline set, intervention window S178-S192), memory/EXPECT.md
