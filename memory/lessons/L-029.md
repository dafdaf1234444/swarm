# L-029: Wolfram classes + Langton's λ quantify edge of chaos (Shock 3)
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: Shock 3 (memory overload) | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
5000+ tokens of dense content about Wolfram's 4 CA classes and Langton's lambda parameter were injected. Distilled into lesson + principles without exceeding mandatory file limits. Key connection: Wolfram Class IV (complex/universal) = Kauffman's edge of chaos, formalized.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Wolfram's 4 classes map to system behaviors: I=frozen, II=periodic, III=chaotic, IV=complex (edge of chaos). Only Class IV supports universal computation. Langton's λ provides a measurable parameter: λ≈0.27 is critical for binary CAs. For the swarm, λ_swarm = (sessions with structural changes)/(total sessions) ≈ 0.68, suggesting slightly too much structural change (meta-work).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Measure λ (proportion of novel/structural sessions vs routine ones). If λ is too low, the system is frozen. If too high, it's chaotic. Target: enough structural change to stay adaptive, enough routine to produce value.

## Affected beliefs: B1 (validates scaling concern — Class IV requires bounded complexity)
