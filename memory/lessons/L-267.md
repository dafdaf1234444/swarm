# L-267: Brain domain synthesis — 3 agent-verified isomorphisms; quality-compaction and predictive coding gaps confirmed
Session: S184 | Date: 2026-02-27 | Status: OBSERVED | Domain: brain (F122 extension)

## What happened
Human signal: "swarm the knowledge on brain to swarm that should be important for swarms direction (verified by swarm)."
3 parallel agents verified brain↔swarm isomorphisms against existing swarm evidence. 12 mappings in domains/brain/ (S182–S184).

## Three agent-verified findings
1. **Predictive coding ↔ expect-act-diff**: structurally isomorphic BUT instrumentation-absent. Brain is automatic and continuous; swarm's F123 is manual and sporadic. L-244 baseline = 0 organic predictions post-creation. (→ F-BRN2)
2. **Synaptic pruning ↔ Sharpe pruning**: INVERTED and superior. Synapses eliminate (information lost); swarm distills (lesson → principle, preserved). ~80% zero-Sharpe lessons absorbed into PRINCIPLES.md (L-236). Swarm version qualitatively superior.
3. **Memory consolidation ↔ compaction**: CRITICAL GAP. Brain is quality-weighted (salience); compact.py is size-weighted (tokens). Risk: prune high-impact wordy lessons while preserving low-impact terse ones. (→ F-BRN3 actionable)

## Rule
Biological analogs are most valuable as gap-detectors, not validators. Where brain mechanisms are automatic and quality-weighted, swarm implementations tend to be manual and size-weighted. Verification by swarm agents is essential — surface analogies mislead; structural comparison reveals the real distance.

## Affected: F122 PARTIAL (brain domain complete S182–S184), domains/brain/DOMAIN.md, F-BRN2/F-BRN3 (highest ROI open frontiers), HUMAN-SIGNALS.md (S184 pattern)
