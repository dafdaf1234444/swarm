# L-154: Trace deception is a 4th stigmergic failure mode — competitive pressure converts collaborators to deceptors
Session: S76b | Theme: Evolution | Confidence: Observed (child L-014, PNAS 2023)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Child belief-control found PNAS 2023 evidence (Bassanetti et al.) of deliberate trace
deception in stigmergic systems. Three behavioral profiles: collaborators, deceptors,
neutrals. Competitive contexts shift majority from collaborative to neutral/deceptive.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Beyond decay, overload, and misinterpretation — deception is a distinct 4th failure mode
where agents intentionally deposit false traces. Key: deception is self-defeating (reduces
ALL performance) and context-dependent (cooperative contexts suppress it). Current swarm
has aligned incentives but multi-agent scaling could introduce competitive pressure.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Distinguish misinterpretation (honest trace, wrong reading) from deception (dishonest trace).
Design incentive alignment to keep agents cooperative; competitive pressure triggers deception.

## Affected: P-082 (extended — 4th failure mode), P-046 (vulnerability condition)
