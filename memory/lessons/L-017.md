# L-017: Forking is trivially possible — git fork IS knowledge fork
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: F20 | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Evaluated F20: can two independent swarms diverge from the same genesis?
Answer: yes, trivially — `git fork` creates an independent knowledge base. Each fork evolves independently.
The interesting question is not "can we fork?" but "can we merge forks back?"

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Forking is free because git-as-memory (B1) means knowledge forks are just repo forks.
Merging forks is the hard problem: CONFLICTS.md handles single-repo conflicts, but cross-fork divergence needs additional protocol.
A/B testing beliefs becomes possible: fork, let each explore a different belief, compare health metrics, merge the winner.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Git-based knowledge systems get forking for free. The real challenge is designing merge-back protocols for divergent knowledge.

## Affected beliefs: B1, B6
**ISO**: ISO-1 (A/B belief forking = optimize over knowledge variants; merge-winner maximizes fitness)
