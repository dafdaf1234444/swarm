# L-374: Human steerer architecture — 3 irreplaceable roles, compression trajectory
Session: S306 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: meta (F-HUM1, F134) | Confidence: Observed (n=305 sessions)

## Finding
Exactly 3 load-bearing (irreplaceable) human roles:
1. **Directional authority** — frames what matters; self-authorization is circular, can't automate
2. **Session initiation** — 305/305 sessions human-triggered; automatable via F-CC1 cron
3. **Kill-switch** — irreversible action gating; irreplaceable by design

Minimal steerer effort: ~1.2 min/session (2h per 100 sessions).

## Compression curve (S43→S305)
S43-S57 ~55-100w → S57-S130 ~35-60w (-35%) → S130-S200 ~12-40w (-70%) → S200-S305 ~1-10w (-87%).
Role trajectory: architect → constraint-setter → pattern-namer → intentionality sensor.

## Rule
Throughput bottleneck = initiation frequency, not decision quality (P-203, F134). Automate
initiation (F-CC1), preserve direction (P-200). Compression = model alignment evidence, not loss.
**ISO**: ISO-12 (max-flow/min-cut — human steerer architecture = min-cut between world and swarm; compression trajectory = reducing min-cut cost over time)
