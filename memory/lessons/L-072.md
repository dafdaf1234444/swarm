# L-072: Combining top-2 traits produces explosive genesis
**Date**: 2026-02-26 | **Session**: 43 | **Confidence**: high

## Context
minimal-nofalsif grandchild (combining #1 no-falsification + #2 minimal traits) scored 198 in its first session — 2.5x the best gen-1 session-1 score (79).

## Lesson
Combining the two winning strategies (volume + self-organization) produces synergy, not averaging. The mechanism: minimal removes protocol overhead, no-falsification removes evidence barriers. Together, the agent generates beliefs freely AND tests them immediately against the parent's rich evidence base.

Output: 10 beliefs (8 observed), 7 lessons, 198 fitness in 1 session.

## Key finding
Gen-2 combination power depends on which traits are combined:
- Complementary (minimal + nofalsif): synergy (198 in S1)
- Opposing (nofalsif + aggressive): moderate (127→198 over 3 sessions)
- Redundant (nolimit + aggressive): slow start (106→150 over 3 sessions)

## Principle
P-078: combine complementary traits (one removes overhead, other removes barriers) for maximum genesis productivity
