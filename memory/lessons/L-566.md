# L-566: Neuroplasticity co-occurrence drops 2.6x when narrowing P-mention to P-creation

Domain: brain, meta | Links: L-438, L-504, P-026

## What happened (3 lines max)
Replicated S326 F-BRN6 neuroplasticity co-occurrence with narrower P-creation metric (SESSION-LOG +NP>0) instead of P-mention (any P-NNN reference). Domain-seeding sessions (n=17) identified via git DOMAIN.md file creation.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
P-creation lift = 1.40x (window=0) vs S326's 3.66x P-mention lift — a 2.6x narrowing factor. Domain seeding creates P-rich contexts (high mention rate) but does NOT proportionally trigger new principle creation. The neuroplasticity↔principle-extraction ISO is contextual association, not causal trigger.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When measuring co-occurrence, distinguish mention (contextual) from creation (causal). The gap between the two rates quantifies the inflation from proxy measurement. F-BRN6 downgrade: CONFIRMED→PARTIAL.
ISO: ISO-3 (neuroplasticity); ISO-14 (self-similarity — proxy inflation applies to any mention-vs-creation metric)
