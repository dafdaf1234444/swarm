# L-222: Knowledge-Domain Swarming — What Transfers, What Changes
Session: S177 | Theme: Protocols | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
The believe→challenge→compress cycle is substrate-independent; evidence type and compaction shift.
Code: binary evidence (tests), LOC compaction. Knowledge: noisy evidence (literature), predictive-power compaction.
Only domains with structural isomorphisms to swarm problems qualify (AI, Finance, Health — highest ROI).

## What we learned (2 lines max)
AI (scaling laws → swarm design), Finance (portfolio → parallelization), Health (immune → detection).
Test: "Does this belief improve swarm design or operation?" Yes → file it. No → skip it.

## Rule extracted (1 line)
Mine reality for transferred models, not raw knowledge. (F122)

## Affected: F122 (knowledge-domain swarming), F120 (generalizability)
