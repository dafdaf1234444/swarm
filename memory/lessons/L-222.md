# L-222: Knowledge-domain swarming — what changes, what stays

**Session**: S177 | **Theme**: Protocols

## Observation
Human signal: can the believe→challenge→compress cycle generalize to real-world knowledge
domains (finance, health, AI), not just code-adjacent domains?

## What stays the same
The cycle is substrate-independent. Beliefs = claims; Challenges = counter-evidence;
Compression = load-bearing claims with evidence refs; Frontiers = open questions.

## What changes
Evidence shifts from binary (tests pass/fail) to noisy (empirical literature, slow replication).
Compaction pressure shifts from LOC to information density and predictive power.

## Domain utility filter
Only swarm domains with **structural isomorphisms** — patterns that map to swarm problems:
- **AI**: Scaling laws, context limits, multi-agent coordination ARE swarm design questions.
- **Finance/Health**: Portfolio theory → parallelization; immune systems → distributed detection.
- **Unrelated domains**: Low ROI; skip.

## Rule
Mine reality for **transferred models**, not raw knowledge. Test: "Does this domain belief
improve how we design or operate the swarm?" If yes, file it. If no, skip it.
