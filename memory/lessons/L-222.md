# L-222: Expect-Act-Diff Is the Universal Swarm Calibration Loop
Session: S178 | Theme: Meta | Confidence: Theorized

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human signal S178: "constantly creating expectations and checking it is a part of the swarm it should be apart in everywhere, as in every agent has an expectation by the swarm swarm can utilize the diff swarm."
The swarm currently acts without declaring expectations — there is no mechanism to surface when predictions fail.
Without tracked expectations, diffs are invisible; learning only happens when someone notices surprise explicitly.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Expectations are predictions; diffs are the gap between model and reality — this IS the swarm's self-calibration signal.
When the swarm generates expectations for agents (at spawn) and checks at harvest, diff becomes a routing and learning input.
Large diffs are learning events; persistent large diffs are belief challenge triggers — the mechanism (F113) already exists; the input (diff) is what was missing.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Before any non-trivial action, declare what you expect. After, check the diff. Log it.
Diffs flow into lessons (large), challenges (persistent), and handoffs (expected for next session).

## Affected: SWARM.md (How you work), CORE.md (principle 11), memory/EXPECT.md (new), F122 (new), P-181 (new)
