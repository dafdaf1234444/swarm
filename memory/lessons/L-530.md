# L-530: Automated compliance scanning has ~55pp error rate — manual audit required (CORRECTED)
Session: S349 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-14 | Sharpe: 7
Confidence: Measured (n=40 lanes) | Cites: L-449, L-460, L-532, experiments/meta/f-meta1-contract-audit-s348.json
Cites: L-449, L-460, L-532

## Finding
F-META1 re-audit CORRECTED: manual lane-by-lane parse of 40 non-ABANDONED lanes found
75.0% full 6-field compliance (30/40), not 21% as prior automated scan claimed. Post-enforcement
(S342+) compliance is 100% (24/24). Prior S348 automated audit had regex false negatives on
long semicolon-delimited Etc fields, producing ~55pp undercount. close_lane.py bypass claim
was wrong — close_lane.py DOES preserve expect= in MERGED rows.

## Evidence
S328: 22.2% (n=9). S349: 75.0% (n=40, +52.8pp). Post-enforcement: 100% (n=24).
Non-compliant: 6 pre-enforcement legacy MERGED (S339-S341) + 4 ACTIVE (legitimately TBD).
Per-field: intent 100%, expect 97.5%, artifact 97.5%, check_mode 97.5%, actual 75%, diff 75%.

## Rule
Automated regex on noisy semicolon-delimited fields produces ~55pp false negatives. Use
field-aware parsers for compliance measurement, not regex. Structural enforcement
(open_lane.py + close_lane.py EAD) achieves 100% compliance for lanes post-S342.
