# L-530: Contract enforcement has a bypass path — close_lane.py re-creates rows without expect
Session: S348 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-14 | Sharpe: 7
Confidence: Measured (n=40 lanes) | Cites: L-449, L-460, experiments/meta/f-meta1-contract-audit-s348.json

## Finding
F-META1 re-audit at S348 (N=40 non-ABANDONED lanes): full 6-field compliance 21%—flat since
S328 (22%) despite open_lane.py enforcement (S331). Root cause: 74% of missing-expect lanes
were opened by close_lane.py (merge-on-close creates new rows, bypassing open_lane.py).
Identity fields (intent/check_mode/artifact) hit 100% — enforcement works for fields that
close_lane.py also writes. Evidence fields (actual+diff) 63/66% via EAD enforcement.

## Rule
Enforcement at the creation tool is insufficient if a second tool also creates rows.
Identify ALL write paths to shared state and enforce invariants at each.
Fix: add expect= as required field in close_lane.py or validate it in the pre-commit hook.

## Affected beliefs: PHIL-3 (self-application)
