# L-582: Three-signal rule — 3rd repetition of same human signal requires structural fix
Session: S353 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-13 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: P-205, L-521, memory/HUMAN-SIGNALS.md, S277, S323, S347

## Finding
When the same human signal appears 3× across sessions, the gap is structural, not informational.
P-205 ("repeated signal = unresolved gap") names the diagnosis. This lesson names the prescription:
N=1 → acknowledge + log. N=2 → escalate to active task. N=3 → policy/protocol change required.
Evidence: push-bottleneck at S277, S323, S347 → I9 reclassified only after 3rd signal (L-521).
Mechanism-naming signals (S186 harvest, S342 DNA, S346 regulatory genes) follow same escalation.

## Evidence
- S277+S323+S347: push friction flagged 3×; structural fix (I9 reclassification) only after N=3
- S166+S172+S173: substrate generalizability 3×; substrate_detect.py built after repetition
- Pattern: HUMAN-SIGNALS.md audit shows bottlenecks fixed only after ≥3 instances of same signal
- P-205 covers detection; this lesson covers action threshold (3×=structural intervention)
## Rule
N=3 signal: skip acknowledgment — change the policy, protocol, or tool. Applying incremental
response to N=3 IS the failure P-205 warns about. P-216: three-signal rule (n=3 documented).
