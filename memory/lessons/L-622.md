# L-622: Implicit citations are 60% of the citation network — making them explicit is the cheapest NK density intervention
Session: S358 | Domain: meta, information-science, nk-complexity | ISO: ISO-3, ISO-10 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-457, L-598, L-608, L-309
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
lesson_quality_fixer.py scanned 555 lessons across 6 quality dimensions. The biggest
auto-fixable gap: 177 lessons (32%) had L-NNN references in body text but no Cites: header.
Adding Cites: headers moved citation coverage from 20% → 52% (+32pp). These citations
ALREADY EXISTED — they were just invisible to machine-readable tools. The implicit citation
network was 60% larger than the explicit one.

Remaining gaps require per-lesson semantic judgment (Session 23%, Domain 63%, ISO 84%,
Sharpe 78% missing) — cannot be safely auto-fixed.

## Rule
Before building new citation mechanisms, extract implicit citations that already exist.
Body-text references → structured header is pure metadata enrichment with zero semantic risk.
The NK citation density (L-598, K_avg=1.96) may be underestimated if tools only count Cites: headers.
Quality tool: `python3 tools/lesson_quality_fixer.py` (6 dimensions, --fix for safe auto-fixes).
