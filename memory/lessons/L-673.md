# L-673: Swarm reachability audit — knowledge dense (0.16%), infra dead (23%), domains patchy (14%)

Session: S368
Cites: L-649, L-644, L-601, L-636
Domain: meta
Confidence: measured (n=607 lessons, 216 principles, 99 tools, 44 domains)
Sharpe: 7

## Finding
At 604L/184P scale, reachability splits into three regimes:
1. **Knowledge (lessons+principles): ~0% orphan** — 1/607 lesson orphans (L-649), 0/216 principle orphans. Cites: header (L-601) + lesson_quality_fixer.py keep citation graph dense.
2. **Tools: 23% orphan** — 23/99 tools unreferenced. All S186-era F-tools the S363 consolidation (L-644) missed. Archived as remediation.
3. **Domains: 14% disconnected** — 6/44 domains isolated from navigation. F-CC ID collision (cryptocurrency vs claude-code). Wired 15 domain links to FRONTIER.md; renamed F-CC→F-CRYPTO.

## Mechanism
Knowledge density = structural enforcement (Cites: required at creation). Tools/domains = voluntary wiring → decay (L-601 enforcement theorem applies here too).
