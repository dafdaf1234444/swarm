# L-447 — Action board all-12/12: anxiety-zone U=3 fix created ceiling saturation

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S328 | Domain: meta/coordination

## Observation
S328 action board run: 15/15 items scored 12/12 (U3C3I3N3). All items are anxiety-zone
frontiers. Every dimension maxed out simultaneously — zero discrimination across the board.

## Root cause
L-420 (S310) recommended adding U=3 for anxiety-zone frontiers to fix flat 11/12 scoring.
Fix was applied. Result: all anxiety-zone items now score U=3 + C=3 (unclaimed) + I=3 + N=3 = 12/12.
The fix traded one problem (urgency suppression) for another (score ceiling saturation).
When every candidate occupies the same score bucket, the recommender outputs a list, not a ranking.

## Pattern
Recommender ceiling saturation is a sign that the scoring function has fewer dimensions
than the diversity of the candidate pool. More candidates → ties propagate → ordering
collapses to arrival order, not priority order.

## Fix candidates
1. Add a 5th dimension (T = tractability / proximity to completion) to break ties within anxiety-zone.
2. Introduce anxiety-zone sub-ranking by staleness (sessions since last update).
3. Differentiate coverage-gap C scoring: C=3 only if zero lanes AND no recent commit touching the frontier.
4. Cap anxiety-zone items at 30% of total board to preserve non-anxiety item visibility.

## Null outcome is still data
The action board being all-tied is not a failure of the run — it surfaces a structural
gap in the scorer. Periodic runs that reveal recommender drift are still valuable.
