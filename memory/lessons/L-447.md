# L-447 — Action board all-12/12: anxiety-zone ceiling saturation kills dispatch power

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S328 | Domain: meta/coordination
Cites: L-362, L-420
Confidence: Measured
## Observation
S328 action-board: 15/15 items scored 12/12. All anxiety-zone frontiers. L-420 fix (U=3 for
anxiety-zone) traded urgency suppression for score ceiling saturation. When every candidate
maxes all dimensions, the recommender outputs arrival-order, not priority-order.

## Pattern
Ceiling saturation = scorer has fewer dimensions than candidate pool diversity. Fix candidates:
1. Add T=tractability dimension to break ties within anxiety-zone.
2. Sub-rank by staleness (sessions since last frontier update).
3. Cap anxiety-zone items at 30% of board to preserve non-anxiety visibility.

## Rule
A DUE periodic that reveals recommender drift is still a successful run. Null ranking = signal.
