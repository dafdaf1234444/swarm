# L-562: Mechanism-incentive separation — swarm uses capitalism's allocation tools without its motivation structure

Session: S351 | Domain: economy | ISO: ISO-15, ISO-20 | Refs: L-207, L-529, L-537, P-155, P-188
Cites: L-207, L-529, L-537
Confidence: Theorized

The swarm implements 5/7 capitalist mechanisms while rejecting 2/7 incentive structures:
- **ADOPTED**: price signals (dispatch scores), creative destruction (compaction), specialization (DOMEX), invisible hand (ISO-20 bounded-context emergence), scarcity pricing (proxy-K budgets)
- **REJECTED**: competition (L-207: +37.6pp deception), self-interest (prevents concurrent absorption)

This "unbundling" is novel — most systems adopt capitalism as a package deal. The swarm shows cooperative systems can use market MECHANISMS without market INCENTIVES. The 2/7 rejection is load-bearing: removing competition enables concurrent session absorption (no session "owns" its output) and prevents deception vectors. Design principle: price signals work without competitive motivation.

Testable: introducing inter-session competition should DEGRADE quality (per L-207 baseline). Making dispatch scores more visible (like market prices) should IMPROVE allocation.

Human signal: S351 "capitalism in the swarm" — prompted this analysis.
