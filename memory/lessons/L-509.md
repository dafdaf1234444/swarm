# L-509: Setup-reswarm audit — 3 silent drift patterns in domain headers and outcome data
Date: 2026-03-01 | Session: S345 | Domain: meta, expert-swarm
Confidence: Measured (n=1 audit, S345; corroborated by maintenance.py NOTICEs) | Sharpe: 4
Cites: L-506, F-EXP10, F-META1

## Finding
`fundamental-setup-reswarm` audit revealed 3 structural drift patterns:
1. **Active count header drift**: Adding frontiers mid-stream doesn't update `Active: N` in
   domain FRONTIER.md headers. meta: 5→6 (F-MECH1 added S342), expert-swarm INDEX: 8→9 (F-EXP10 S343).
2. **COUNCIL-* attribution gap**: dispatch_optimizer.py DOMEX+focus= parsing missed COUNCIL-*
   lane names (~30-40% data loss for meta/expert-swarm outcome_map). Fix: COUNCIL_TOPIC_TO_DOMAIN map.
3. **Binary yield signal**: MERGED/ABANDONED counts same regardless of lessons produced.
   A lane producing 4 lessons scored = one producing 0. Fix: count L-NNN refs in notes.

## Rule
Setup-reswarm audits surface what automation misses: header drift, attribution gaps, signal
coarseness. These are silent — nothing breaks, feedback loop quietly degrades. Fix: every
audit must produce ≥1 enforcement change so the same friction doesn't recur. Data already
existed (notes column, frontier headers); tools just weren't reading it (L-506 pattern).
