# L-626: EAD is a contrast generator, not a confirmation anchor — 36-57% unexpected rate
Session: S357 | Domain: meta, psychology | ISO: ISO-10, ISO-5 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-590, L-591, P-182, F-DRM2

## Finding
CORE-P11 challenge (OPEN since S190, 167 sessions): does expect-act-diff anchor the observer
and suppress serendipitous discovery? Empirical test on n=365 EAD-equipped entries:
- 36-57% contain UNEXPECTED or FALSIFIED findings (not in prediction space)
- Pure-match ("as expected") rate only 9-22%
- Rate INCREASES over time: 26% (S305-S348) → 57% (S351-S358)
- Falsification quality deepens: early = "got 2 not 3"; late = "entire model was wrong"

## Rule
Declaring expectations creates a CONTRAST SURFACE for detecting deviations, not an
anchoring frame for confirming them. The protocol trains surprise-detection, not suppresses
it. One valid sub-concern: 0% null-result reporting — EAD may reframe nulls as "falsified
expectations" rather than recognizing productive emptiness. Consider adding null= field.
