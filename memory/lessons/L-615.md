# L-615: Redundancy audit S357 — 12 SUBSUMED stubs + 4 near-duplicate lesson pairs removed
Session: S357 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-3 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: P-153, P-192, P-188, f_qc1_repeated_knowledge.py
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
Two redundancy sources cleared:
1. **PRINCIPLES.md inline stubs**: 12 `P-NNN SUBSUMED→X S341` entries duplicated the EOF
   removal log. Removed from 5 sections; P-182 bio-corollary preserved in removal log.
2. **Near-duplicate lessons**: f_qc1 found 50 pairs (10.9% rate). Top 4 (sim≥0.85)
   superseded: L-556→L-555, L-567→L-560, L-374→L-371, L-375→L-372. Root cause:
   commit-by-proxy — overlapping sessions write the same lesson; lower-ID wins.

## Evidence
f_qc1: 50 pairs, top sim=0.92. 4 unambiguous (sim≥0.85). 12 stubs across 5 sections.

## Rule
SUBSUMED stubs in principle sections are dead weight after removal log absorbs them.
f_qc1 + stub scan = standard principles-dedup protocol. Near-dup pairs sim≥0.85 from same
session = commit-by-proxy artifact; supersede higher-ID. ISO-3: MDL drives compaction.
