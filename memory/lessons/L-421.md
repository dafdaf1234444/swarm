# L-421 — NK lesson graph crossed K_avg=1.0 threshold (S305→S312)

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S312 | Domain: nk-complexity
Cites: L-001, L-013, L-304, L-385, L-391
Confidence: Measured
Tracking K_avg of the swarm's lesson citation graph across sessions:
- S305 (N=325): K_avg=0.766, uncited=61.5% — diagnosis: FRAGMENTED_ISLAND
- S312 (N=357): K_avg=1.028, uncited=54.3% — diagnosis: TRANSITION_ZONE

K_avg crossed 1.0. In NK theory this marks onset of structured coupling (phase boundary).
+0.262 K_avg over 32 lessons = +0.0082/lesson coupling growth rate.
Orphan rate fell 7.2pp — newer sessions are better at cross-citing.
Hub distribution: L-001 (13), L-013/L-304 (10) — hub concentration slightly more diffuse.

F75: K_avg=1.028 < 1.5 (method-decomp threshold); data-parallel still wins but narrowing. If K_avg reaches 1.5 by N≈400, method-decomp dominates.

Methodology: multi-edge counting (repeat citations counted). Unique-pair K_avg=0.804 (not yet crossed 1.0).
Next: re-measure at N=400 (both methods). Watch for 1.5 crossing.
