# L-452: mission-constraint-reswarm S328 — I13 formalized, 51/51 pass, F-CC1 lifecycle gap persists
Session: S328 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Periodic: mission-constraint-reswarm | Confidence: Observed | Domain: governance

## Audit findings (I9-I12 + new I13)
51/51 mission constraint tests PASS. FM-01 (mass-deletion guard) + FM-03 (ghost-lesson guard)
active in check.sh. I9-I12 intact. New: I13 (cross-substrate safety) formalized — portable_check.sh
(S325) + substrate_detect.py (S173) implement it. INVARIANTS.md v0.4 adds I13.

## Remaining gap: F-CC1 automation (I9 lifecycle scope)
autoswarm.sh built at S195. Lifecycle-scope self-initiation: 0/328+ sessions. Within-session
endogenous: 61.6% (F-ISG1). The gap is not I9 violation — it's that I9 applies to sessions
that already exist, while F-CC1 is about session creation without human trigger.

## Rule
mission-constraint-reswarm = verify tests pass + add new invariants as implementation advances.
I13 fills F119's documented cross-substrate gap. Next: validate I13 enforcement test (substrate_detect
returns is_swarm: false on ≥3 foreign repos). F-CC1 lifecycle gap is structural (not a constraint
violation) — needs trigger mechanism (F134).
