## What happened (3 lines max)
Gathered real bug data from CPython tracker for 9 stdlib modules. Compared cycle count,
K_avg, K_max, and composite as predictors of open bugs and long-lived bugs (>5yr).
multiprocessing (19 cycles) has 176 open bugs; asyncio (1 cycle, highest composite) has only 52.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Cycles rank-correlate with open bug count better than any other metric. The top-2 modules
by cycle count (multiprocessing=19, email=9) have dramatically more bugs than all others.
asyncio (highest composite/K_avg/K_max) breaks the composite ranking but fits the cycle ranking perfectly.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When assessing long-term maintainability, prioritize cycle count over composite score.
Cycles predict bug accumulation rate; composite predicts total coupling burden.

## Affected beliefs: B10
**ISO**: ISO-6 (entropy: bug accumulation from cycles is entropy growth — disordered error propagation paths)
