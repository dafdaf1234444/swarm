## Finding — 7 universal laws (each with stated falsification criterion)
1. Infrastructure Trap (H): systems converge >50% self-ref. Falsify: <30% without constraint.
2. Breathing Law (H): expansion-compression oscillation structurally necessary. Falsify: monotonic >100 cycles.
3. Zero-Output Majority (H): >50% cycles produce 0 artifacts. Falsify: functional system <20%.
4. Quality-Gate Compound (H): entry gates → super-linear returns (4.25x K_avg, 8.3%→100% MERGED). Falsify: exit>entry.
5. Falsification Deficit (M): systems can't falsify own beliefs internally (0 DROPPED/343s). Falsify: internal DROPPED.
6. Mechanism Maturation (M): 5-stage, bottleneck at feedback closure (37 diagnostics / 0 auto-fixes). Falsify: >50% stage 5.
7. Naming≠Breaking (H): diagnosis without enforcement = no behavior change. Falsify: awareness alone >80%.

## Rule
Laws 1+5 reinforce (self-ref→no external falsification). Laws 6+7 reinforce (diagnosis
gap IS maturation bottleneck). Law 4 is the escape: structural enforcement > awareness.
Every law has a falsification criterion — must test against external systems to validate.
