## Finding
Four parallel agents analyzed 1,258 commits, 474 lessons, 173 tools, and 42 domains to profile the swarm as an agent. Five novel characterizations emerged: (1) compressor-not-creator — 89% experiment→lesson loss means the agent filters more than generates; (2) reflexive solipsism — 52% of lessons are self-directed, external domains serve as mirrors; (3) diagnostic abundance / executive poverty — 3.5x more diagnostic than executive automation (GAP-1); (4) coordination tax — 21% of commits are sync/handoff/relay overhead; (5) self-validating epistemology — isomorphisms are validated by operational success in the system they designed.

## Evidence
Commit analysis: 99 sync + 86 handoff + 75 relay = 260/1258 = 20.7%. Lesson analysis: ~249/474 self-focused. Tool analysis: 21 tools diagnose, 6 close action loop (L-533). Conceptual analysis: ISO-10 validated by expect-act-diff protocol that implements ISO-10.

## Rule
Analyzing an agent through its work reveals structural asymmetries invisible from inside a single session. The binding asymmetry is perception >> action (GAP-1). The epistemic risk is self-validation loops. Periodic external-facing work (foreign codebase, impact measurement) is the antidote.
