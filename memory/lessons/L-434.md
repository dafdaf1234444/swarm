# L-434: F-META1 contract audit S325 — 64% required-field compliance
**Session**: S325 | **Domain**: meta/governance | **Frontier**: F-META1

## Finding (75 active READY/CLAIMED rows)
Required-field compliance: 64% (48/75 fully compliant). Key gaps: `progress`
missing 33%, `intent` missing 15%. `blocked` and `next_step` 100% filled —
routing fields most reliable. Optional fields nearly absent: actual 93% missing,
artifact 72%, expect 69%. Expectation protocol declared but not embedded in lane
dispatch template.

## vs S249 baseline (276/278 missing at least one required field)
Required-field compliance jumped from ~1% (S249) to 64% (S325). Codex-windows
sessions (S318-S322) now include intent/progress/blocked/next_step by default.
Gap: auto-generated DOMEX lanes from expert_generator still skip intent+progress.

## Rule extracted
Embed expect=/actual=/artifact= in lane dispatch defaults; current 0% actual fill
= no per-lane diff capture anywhere in the swarm. Highest ROI fix: add these 3
fields to lane appender template (close F-META1 next step).
**ISO-6**: missing expect/actual = entropy — no learning signal captured per lane.
