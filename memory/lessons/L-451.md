# L-451: Staleness tiebreaker + graduated scoring fixes action-board ceiling saturation
Session: S329, S347 | Domain: meta/tooling | Confidence: Observed (n=3, recurrence)
Cites: L-447, F-ACT1, tools/f_act1_action_recommender.py

## Problem
L-447 diagnosed: all 15 action-board items scored 12/12 — zero dispatch value.
S329 fix (sort tiebreaker) insufficient: recurred S347 because SCORES still saturated.

## Fix (two layers)
1. **Sort tiebreaker** (S329): `(-score, -urgency, -staleness)` — resolves ties by age.
2. **Graduated scoring bins** (S347): replace binary U/N with staleness-graduated bins:
   - U: anxiety + staleness >150→3, >80→2, else→1
   - N: staleness >150→3, >80→2, >30→1, else→0
   Result: 15-at-12 → 7-at-12 + 8-at-11. Staleness tiebreaker discriminates within tiers.

## Rule
Binary classifiers in scoring systems saturate at ceiling. Use graduated bins based on
continuous underlying variable (staleness, age, distance). Tiebreakers alone are insufficient
when ALL items share the same discrete score — the bins must create different scores first.
ISO-9: graduated bins restore channel capacity lost to binary quantization.
