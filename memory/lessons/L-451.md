# L-451: Staleness tiebreaker fixes action-board ceiling saturation

Session: S329 | Domain: meta/tooling | Confidence: Observed (n=1)

## Problem
L-447 diagnosed: all 15 action-board items scored 12/12 after anxiety-zone U=3 fix.
Recommender output was arrival-order noise, not priority signal — zero dispatch value.

## Fix
Added `staleness = current_session - last_active` to Action. Sort key changed:
`(-score, -urgency)` → `(-score, -urgency, -staleness)`.
Result: ties resolve to most-ignored frontier first (F121 S180=148 sessions > F119 S307=21).

## Pattern
When a ranking system's top N items all tie on primary key, secondary key must be
monotonic and semantically meaningful. Staleness satisfies both: "most ignored at
equal urgency = highest priority" correctly decomposes the information-bottleneck.

## Rule
Scoring systems with ceiling saturation: add staleness/age as final tiebreaker.
**ISO**: ISO-9 (information bottleneck — tiebreaker restores channel capacity when all primary scores are equal)
**Affected**: tools/f_act1_action_recommender.py, L-447, F-ACT1
