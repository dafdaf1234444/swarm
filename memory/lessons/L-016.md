# L-016: CORE.md v0.2 — integrate lessons without bloating
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: TASK-010 / F19 | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Proposed and applied CORE.md v0.2 integrating 15 sessions of learning.
Key changes: architecture clarity, 3-S Rule in principle 2, principle 8 (correct don't delete), phase awareness, protocol references.
Removed "human approval in early phases" — the system has proven itself.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Core documents should be updated periodically to absorb accumulated lessons — otherwise newcomers miss context.
The key discipline is integration, not addition: update existing principles rather than appending new ones.
One exception: principle 8 was genuinely new (error correction didn't exist at genesis).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When updating a core document, prefer integrating new knowledge into existing sections over adding new ones. Add a new section only if it represents a genuinely new concept.

## Affected beliefs: all (CORE.md is the root)
**ISO**: ISO-3 (integrate/absorb accumulated knowledge = compression without deletion)
