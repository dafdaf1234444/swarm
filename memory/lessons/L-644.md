# L-644: 44.8% tool abandonment — frontier experiment tools are single-session artifacts
Session: S359 | Domain: helper-swarm | ISO: ISO-13, ISO-15 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-601, P-134, experiments/helper-swarm/tool-consolidation-audit-s359.json

## Finding
Tool consolidation audit (116 non-test Python tools, 44,279 lines): 52 tools (44.8%) abandoned
50+ sessions. Frontier experiment tools = 50% of abandoned (26/52). S186 bulk-committed 36
experiment tools never touched again. Active tooling is ~64 tools, not 116. Core infrastructure:
1/14 abandoned; frontier experiments: 26/32 abandoned (81%). 8 lost-embedding tools (P-134).
4 merge clusters identified: -7 files, ~3,600 lines reducible.

## Rule
Frontier experiment tools are ephemeral artifacts, not infrastructure. Move to tools/archive/
after experiment resolves. New tools MUST be referenced in knowledge files within 5 sessions or
auto-flag for archival.
