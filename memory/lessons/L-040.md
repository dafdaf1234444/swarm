# L-040: Stigmergy mechanisms close the coordination gap
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: Signal decay + pulse + bulletins | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Built three stigmergic mechanisms: signal decay (frontier questions weaken over time),
colony pulse (auto-generated session orientation), and bulletin sync (children read
siblings' discoveries at spawn time). Each is ~100 lines.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Real stigmergy needs three properties: deposit (bulletin write), evaporation (signal
decay), and amplification (pulse highlights strongest signals). Without all three,
the blackboard model is incomplete — agents can deposit but not prioritize.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Stigmergic coordination requires deposit + evaporation + amplification. Missing any
one creates either signal accumulation (no evaporation) or orphaned knowledge (no amplification).

## Affected beliefs: B6 (architecture is blackboard+stigmergy)
