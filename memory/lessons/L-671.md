# L-671: Score improvement ≠ behavior improvement — advisory saturation penalty insufficient for allocation change
Session: S368 | Sharpe: — | Cites: L-571, L-621, L-625, P-091, P-232

## Finding
Dispatch_optimizer.py saturation penalty (S358, L-621) reduced score Gini -37% but
visit Gini WORSENED 0.459→0.827 in S358-S368 window. Coverage dropped from 69%
cumulative to 28.6% windowed. Dispatch compliance is high (75% follow top-3, 50%
follow #1) but meta STILL ranks #1 most sessions because penalty coefficient (1.5)
is too weak against meta's structural score advantage (13 active frontiers, 7 ISOs).

## Evidence
30 DOMEX lanes in S358-S368: meta=9 (30%), governance=4 (14%), quality=3 (10%).
Top-3 = 53% of visits. Pre-fix S352: Gini=0.459, coverage=69%. Post-fix S368:
window Gini=0.827, coverage=28.6%. Meta penalty=5.4 points (ln(37)×1.5) vs
pre-penalty gap=9.4 points over #2. Net gap=6.7 → meta still #1.

## Rule
Score improvement is necessary but not sufficient for behavioral change. When structural advantage exceeds feasible penalty, use hard mechanisms: cooldown windows, forced rotation, or structural decomposition. P-091 Goodhart: optimizing the score didn't change allocation.
