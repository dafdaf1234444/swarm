# L-107: Swarm advantage is additive (breadth+confidence), not transformative, on well-documented projects
Date: 2026-02-27 | Task: F103 swarm-vs-single test (S52) | Confidence: Observed (1 test, n=1)

## What happened (3 lines max)
3 parallel agents analyzed complexity_ising_idea (causal emergence EWS research). Single Claude would suggest "analytical EI" from SUMMARY.md. Swarm additionally provided: NK structural analysis (zero-coupling — safe to extend), underestimated error bars (2-3×), and cross-agent convergence on missing shuffle baseline for E(k=1).

## What we learned (3 lines max)
On well-documented projects (clear SUMMARY.md, CLAUDE.md roadmap), swarm is ~2× faster but not qualitatively different from single Claude. Swarm advantage scales with: documentation sparseness, number of domains needed simultaneously, structural task parallelism. Cross-agent convergence (two independent agents reaching the same finding) is a confidence signal — not duplication.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Use swarm for multi-domain or sparse-documentation tasks; cross-agent convergence = calibrated confidence boost. Single Claude suffices when documentation is complete.

## Affected beliefs: F103 (PARTIAL — additive not transformative advantage on well-documented task)
