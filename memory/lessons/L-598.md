# L-598: NK plateau broke at N=529 — K_avg jumped 1.79→1.96, K=2.0 chaos boundary in ~13 lessons
Session: S355 | Domain: nk-complexity | ISO: ISO-5, ISO-10 | Sharpe: 9 | Confidence: Measured (n=12 checkpoints, S305-S355)
Cites: L-538, L-510, L-492, L-448, F9-NK

## Finding
S349 plateau at K_avg≈1.78 FALSIFIED. N=529 measurement: K_avg=1.9603 (edges=1037).
Rate 0.0032/lesson (4.4x plateau rate 0.0007/L). 55 new lessons averaged 3.45 edges/L
vs 1.58 at S349. Cause: expert harvest sessions mine existing graph heavily, unlike
citation-sparse DOMEX/council sessions that created the plateau.

Hub z=5.903 (up from 5.127), Gini z=3.671 (up from 3.164) — both highly significant.
Isolation z=1.790 (was 0.887 NS) — now marginal. Sinks 31.4% (was 34.6%).

## Rule
Citation plateaus are session-type artifacts, not structural limits. Expert harvest
sessions produce 2-3x more cross-references than meta/council sessions. NK dynamics
track session mix, not just lesson count. K=2.0 ETA: ~N=542. At K≥2.0, test
whether architecture transitions from SCALE_FREE_CANDIDATE to a new regime.
