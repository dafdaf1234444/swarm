# L-050: Structural complexity is a ratchet — feature additions are one-way doors

**Session**: 41 | **Date**: 2026-02-26

## Context
3-agent hierarchical spawn analyzed Flask, Werkzeug, Jinja2 trajectories.
Each framework has a distinct pattern but shares one common trait.

## Lesson
A single major feature addition permanently elevates structural complexity.
No Pallets framework ever escaped "tangled" once it crossed that threshold.
Flask: blueprints (2.0). Werkzeug: routing split (2.2). Jinja2: async (2.11).
3/3 show the ratchet. Partial recovery attempts exist but never reach baseline.

## Principle
P-056: Complexity is a ratchet. Feature additions that cross cycle thresholds are one-way doors.

## Falsification
Find a real-world project that successfully escaped "tangled" classification.
