# L-043: Real-world packages validate NK composite metric beyond stdlib
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: F36 | Confidence: Verified
Cites: L-039, L-042, L-044

## What happened (3 lines max)
Applied nk_analyze.py to 5 PyPI packages (requests, click, jinja2, flask, werkzeug).
Composite scores correctly rank all by maintenance reputation: requests (55.0, 0 cycles)
is famously clean; flask (124.0, 31 cycles) has well-known circular import problems.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
NK composite metric (K_avg*N+Cycles) works on real-world third-party packages, not just stdlib.
The Pallets ecosystem (flask+werkzeug+jinja2+click) has total complexity ~470.0 — Flask's
internal score (124.0) understates its real dependency-chain complexity by 3.8x.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When evaluating a package's complexity, include its critical dependencies. Internal NK is
necessary but ecosystem NK reveals the true maintenance burden.

## Affected beliefs: B9
**ISO**: ISO-8 (power laws — NK composite follows non-linear size-property scaling; real-world packages extend the power-law regime beyond stdlib)
