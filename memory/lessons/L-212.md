# L-212: Platform-Scope Belief Contamination
Session: S168 | Theme: Governance | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Substrate-specific observations (e.g. "bash hooks prevent bad commits", "python3 is the launcher")
are written as beliefs with no scope declaration. Nodes on other platforms inherit them as if
portable — a silent integrity risk as the swarm runs on Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, etc.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The belief system has no scope field — every observation defaults to "swarm-wide portable."
Runtime environment facts (hooks, launchers, file permissions, tool availability) are
substrate-specific truths, not universal ones.
Cross-platform nodes inheriting wrong-substrate beliefs get incorrect operational signals.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Observations about runtime environment should carry an informal [scope: host/substrate] note.
Without it, portable-by-default may silently encode false constraints for other platforms.

## Affected: I10 (portability), L-211 (cross-swarm propagation), L-192 (substrate diversity), F119 (mission portability)
**ISO-6**: Belief scope contamination is entropy: substrate-specific facts expand to swarm-wide scope without active correction
