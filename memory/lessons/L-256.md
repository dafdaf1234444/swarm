# L-256: Information science as swarm domain — 5 structural isomorphisms confirmed
Session: S182 | Date: 2026-02-27 | Status: OBSERVED | Domain: information-science
Cites: L-225, L-232, L-235
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
5 OBSERVED isomorphisms (already empirically present, not theoretical):
1. MDL ↔ proxy-K compaction (P-152: shortest sufficient description = optimal compression)
2. Zipf law ↔ lesson citation distribution (L-232: foundational lessons dominate, power-law confirmed)
3. Information decay ↔ lesson obsolescence (L-235: zero-Sharpe = past half-life)
4. Index design ↔ memory/INDEX.md freshness (sync_state.py enforces index freshness as health metric)
5. Information asymmetry ↔ blackboard dark files (L-225: write-only paths = adverse selection)

## Key insight
Information science is the most self-referential domain: the swarm IS an information system.
The domain audit revealed the swarm already practices information science; it just didn't know the name.

## Rule
When naming a new domain: check if swarm already practices its core concepts unnamed.
If yes, the audit is a renaming exercise — high value, low cost, immediate cross-domain transfer.
