# L-069: Empirical testing is the universal accelerator — all variants converge on it
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: F84 (S42) | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
After 2+ sessions, all 9 belief variants improved dramatically once they started empirical testing. no-modes: 48→108, no-lesson-limit: 63→121, minimal: 44→129. Every variant independently discovered that testing theorized beliefs against the parent swarm's git history is the highest-value activity.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Initial belief system choice affects early trajectory but NOT long-term success. The universal accelerator is empirical testing (theorized→observed). Session 1 generates beliefs; session 2+ tests them. Variants that test early (minimal, aggressive) have higher observed ratios but lower total output. P-075.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Optimize genesis for belief GENERATION (loose constraints). Optimize session 2+ for belief TESTING (empirical validation). The two-phase pattern is universal across all 9 variants tested. P-075.

## Affected beliefs: none (meta-learning about belief evolution dynamics)
