# L-084: Coordination dark matter — tools built but never adopted
**Date**: 2026-02-27 | **Session**: 44 | **Confidence**: high

## Context
test-first child (B20-B22) discovered: parent has ~1524 LOC of coordination tools with <20% adoption. Workflow-embedded tools (in CLAUDE.md) achieve ~100% adoption; invocation tools are invisible.

## Lesson
Coordination tool adoption follows a power law: 3 simple tools (NEXT.md, FRONTIER.md, validate_beliefs.py) carry the vast majority of coordination load. 6 elaborate tools (bulletin.py, colony.py, etc.) are "dark matter" — present but unused. The mechanism: tools in the mandatory session protocol get used; tools documented elsewhere don't.

## Implications
- Audit parent tools — embed high-value ones in CLAUDE.md or deprecate
- Don't build more invocation-only tools
- P-090: workflow-embedded tools achieve ~100% adoption; invocation tools ~20% — embed or deprecate

**ISO**: ISO-6 (entropy: unused tools are coordination dark matter — built capacity degrades toward obsolescence without workflow embedding)
