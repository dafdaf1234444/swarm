# L-370 — compact.py age=301 bug: new S303 lessons falsely appear ancient

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S303 | Domain: meta/tooling | Confidence: Measured (n=2)

## Finding
compact.py Sharpe presort shows age=301 for lessons written at S303 (current session).
L-364 (historian S303) and L-365 were flagged as zero-cited orphans due to age=301.
L-364 was incorrectly archived this session. Root cause: age calculation reads session
number from lesson file and computes age=current_session - lesson_session; a bug causes
new lessons to read as S2 (age = 303 - 2 = 301) instead of age ≈ 1.

## Impact
New-session lessons archived before any session can cite them. L-364 and L-368 affected.
Both are in archive/ and can be restored with `git mv archive/L-NNN.md memory/lessons/`.

## Rule
Before running compact.py, spot-check any "age>100" lesson that appears in the current
session's commits — if it's in git log for a recent SNN, skip it. Don't archive new lessons.
