# L-370 — compact.py age=301 bug: new S303 lessons falsely appear ancient

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S303 | Domain: meta/tooling | Confidence: Measured (n=2)

## Finding
compact.py Sharpe presort shows age=301 for lessons written at S303 (this session).
L-364 and L-368 falsely flagged as zero-cited orphans and archived. Root cause: age
calculation reads session number from file, bug causes new lessons to appear as S2
(age = 303 - 2 = 301). Restore with `git mv archive/L-NNN.md memory/lessons/`.

## Rule
Before running compact.py, spot-check any "age>100" lesson that appears in the current
session's commits — if it's in git log for a recent SNN, skip it. Don't archive new lessons.
