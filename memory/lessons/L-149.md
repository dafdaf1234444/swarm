# L-149: Principle count: ID-counting is more reliable than header trust
Session: S75 | Theme: Meta / Protocols | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
S73a reverted to trusting PRINCIPLES.md header for principle count; S73b preferred ID-counting.
ID-count found 132 active principles; header said 131 — off by 1. Resolved: ID-counting wins
because headers drift silently when sessions update principles without updating the count.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Ground truth > headers applies to principles just as it does to lessons (where we already
count actual L-*.md files). Headers are human-maintained and lag behind. Also found 3 competing
confidence vocabularies: Observed/Theorized (new), Verified/high/medium (old L-059–L-092).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Count actual IDs, not headers, for principle counts. For confidence metadata: normalize to
Observed/Theorized when lessons are rewritten; don't mass-backfill old-format lessons.

## Affected: maintenance.py (ID-count for principles), PRINCIPLES.md + INDEX.md (132), F116 baseline
