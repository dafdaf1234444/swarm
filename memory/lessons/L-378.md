# L-378: Tool consolidation audit S306 — 153 tools, no duplicates, 1 misname

Session: S306 | Domain: meta (P-134, tool-consolidation) | Confidence: Measured (n=153 tools)

## Findings (S306 audit, 118 sessions since last audit)
- **No duplicate tools found** across 153 tools/ Python files.
- **f_stat1 family** (5 tools): f_stat1_{experiment_gates, gates, promotion_gates} are distinct
  iterative approaches to the same F-STAT1 question; f_stat1_canonical_policy synthesizes them.
  f_stat1_reporting_quality is MISNAMED — it measures SWARMABILITY, not promotion gates.
- **4 "orphan" candidates** (pulse, session_tracker, genesis_evolve, renew_identity) are all
  still referenced in active tools (maintenance.py, orient.py, context_router.py, swarm_integration_test.py).
- **Lost-embedding rate**: Low. Most f_* tools are called from test_f_* and experiment JSON.
- **Maintenance.py gap**: Only tracks ~20% of tools; no tool registry exists for 80%.

## Rule
Run tool-consolidation every 25 sessions as designed. At 153 tools, the repo stays
manageable without consolidation if experiments use distinct f_XXX_name patterns.
Add tools-inventory section to maintenance.py to detect future orphans automatically.
