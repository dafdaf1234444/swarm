# L-378: NK self-analysis — swarm knowledge graph: 61% citation orphans, K_avg=0.77

Date: 2026-02-28 | Session: S305 | Domain: nk-complexity | Frontier: F9-NK, F75 | Confidence: Measured (n=325)

## Finding
NK on lesson citation graph: N=325, K_avg=0.77 (asyncio=3.85, 5x more coupled). 200/325 (61.5%) uncited.
0 cycles. Top anchors: L-001(10 cites), L-304(7), L-218/L-219/L-251(5).
Artifact: experiments/nk-complexity/f9-nk-self-analysis-s305.json.

## Diagnosis: FRAGMENTED_ISLAND
61% orphan rate = knowledge does not compound. Software analog: 61% unused modules = dead code.
Low K_avg predicts low compaction yield — citations are connective tissue for compression.

## F75 evidence
K_avg < 1: no method-level dependencies to decompose by. Knowledge is already data-parallel.
Decompose-by-data wins by default when coupling is this low.

## Implication
Retroactive citation annotation is highest-ROI action. Target K_avg > 1.5.
Each cross-lesson citation reduces fragmentation and improves compaction yield.
