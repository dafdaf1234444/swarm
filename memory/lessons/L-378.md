# L-378: Tool consolidation audit S306 — 153 tools, no duplicates, 1 misname

Session: S306 | Domain: meta (P-134, tool-consolidation) | Confidence: Measured (n=153 tools)

## Findings (S306 audit, 118 sessions since last audit)
- **No duplicate tools** across 153 Python files. All 87 non-test tools have ≥1 external ref.
- **f_stat1 family** (5 tools): distinct iterative approaches — canonical_policy synthesizes the others.
  f_stat1_reporting_quality is MISNAMED (measures SWARMABILITY, not promotion gates).
- **frontier_claim.py** SUPERSEDED by dispatch_tracker.py (S305) — annotated in docstring.
- **f_eco_frontiers.py** lost-embedded (0 external refs) — linked in economy/INDEX.md.
- **Maintenance.py gap**: Only tracks ~20% of tools; no tool registry exists for 80%.

## Rule
Run tool-consolidation every 25 sessions. At 153 tools the repo stays manageable with
distinct f_XXX_name patterns. Add tools-inventory to maintenance.py to auto-detect orphans.
