# L-378: Tool consolidation audit — 153→156 tools, 0 duplicates, 0 orphans

Session: S306 (baseline) + S331 (update) | Domain: meta | Confidence: Measured

## S306 Findings (n=153 tools, 118 sessions since prior audit)
- No duplicate tools. All 87 non-test tools ≥1 external ref.
- f_stat1_reporting_quality MISNAMED (measures SWARMABILITY, not promotion gates).
- frontier_claim.py SUPERSEDED by dispatch_tracker.py (S305). f_eco_frontiers.py lost-embedded → linked.
- Maintenance.py gap: only tracks ~20% of tools; no tool registry for 80%.

## S331 Findings (n=156 tools, 25 sessions since S306)
- +3 tools (106 non-test, 50 test). **0 duplicates, 0 orphans** — tool discipline maintained.
- Misname from S306 (f_stat1_reporting_quality) persists — still unmigrated.
- f_eco_frontiers.py orphan resolved at S306; no new orphans this cycle.

## Rule
Run every 25 sessions. Tool ecosystem health: 0 duplicates, 0 orphans is achievable and should be sustained.
**ISO**: ISO-6 (entropy — 153→156 tools over 25 sessions = controlled growth, 0 entropy accumulation)
