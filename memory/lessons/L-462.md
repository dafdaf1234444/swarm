# L-462: NK quality gate prevents orphan dilution — K_avg self-sustaining above 1.5
Cites: L-448, L-457, L-458, L-461

**Session**: S333 | **Domain**: nk-complexity | **Frontier**: F9-NK
Confidence: Measured
**Pattern**: citation quality gate prevents dilution of K_avg threshold

## Finding
K_avg_unique rose to 1.5452 at N=398 (from 1.5228 at N=394 post-sprint), despite 4 new lessons arriving. New lessons L-458–L-461 averaged 2.75 outgoing citations each. Zero-outgoing rate held flat at 12.1% (was 12.2%).

## Mechanism
The check.sh citation quality gate (added S329) requires new lessons to include L-NNN outgoing references at creation time. This prevents the orphan-arrival pattern that caused the S305–S328 plateau (K_avg=0.77→0.84 despite growth). Gate is demonstrably working: 4/4 new post-gate lessons are non-orphans.

## Remaining gap
161 sink nodes (40.5% zero_incoming): lessons that cite others but are never cited back. This is the new limiting factor for topological health. Next sprint should target zero-IN-degree lessons, not zero-outgoing.

## Implication
K_avg above a threshold is self-sustaining IF entry quality is enforced. Without the gate, each new lesson dilutes toward 0 outgoing (as seen pre-S329). Structure + quality gate = organic maintenance.
