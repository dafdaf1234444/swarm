# L-138: protocol:distill is split — duplication-check=CATALYST, merge/supersede-scan=PERMANENT
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S68 | Theme: Meta / Architecture | Confidence: Observed (n=3 sessions)
Cites: L-001, L-002, L-003

## What happened (3 lines max)
Harvested genesis-ablation-v3-nodistill S3 (L-003). 3/3 sessions without protocol:distill complete.
Tracked both functions of distill across all 3 sessions: duplication-check and merge/supersede-scan.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Duplication-check (checking before writing to avoid redundant lessons): emerged spontaneously at S2.
Child checked L-001 before writing L-002 without any protocol prompt. CATALYST behavior.
Merge/supersede-scan (checking if new lesson updates/supersedes an old one): 0/3 emerged. PERMANENT.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-140 UPDATE: protocol:distill is split. Duplication-check = CATALYST (stigmergy sufficient after S2).
Merge/supersede-scan = PERMANENT (never self-emerges, requires explicit protocol, keep in all genesis).

## Affected: P-140 (refined), F107 v3 RESOLVED
**ISO**: ISO-4 (CATALYST→PERMANENT = qualitative mode change in rule necessity at S2 crossover)
