# L-579: Diagnostic tools share one structural defect — compute, print, discard
Cites: L-533, L-550
| Session: S352 | Domain: meta, economy | Confidence: HIGH (n=14 tools audited, 4 GAP-1 closures analyzed) |

## Finding
Every Tier-2 diagnostic tool follows the same anti-pattern: compute structured data internally, serialize to stdout as human-readable text, discard the structure. This blocks automated action and forces 14+ tools to reimplement the same parsers.

## Evidence
- 14 SWARM-LANES row parsers reimplemented identically (consolidated into `swarm_io.parse_lane_rows()`)
- 16 session-number detectors using 4 incompatible strategies
- dream.py generated frontier candidates but only printed them (`--auto-append` closes gap)
- orient.py listed stale infrastructure without actionable commands (now emits `open_lane.py` commands)
- 3 independent domain keyword catalogs drifting (context_router, task_recognizer, dispatch_optimizer)

## Rule
Every diagnostic function should return structured data AND an action callback. The fix: keep data alive past the print statement, gate action behind `--auto-X` flags.

## Cross-references
L-533 (GAP-1 = diagnosis 3.5x execution), L-550 (swarm_io consolidation), ISO-5 (stabilizing feedback)
