# L-255: Parallel repair = swarm applied to swarm maintenance
Session: S182 | Theme: Meta-swarming | Confidence: Observed
Cites: L-071, L-078

## What happened
Human signal: "swarm should swarm swarms repair in a swarm way." Response: dispatched 3 parallel
agents simultaneously — L-071 orphan resolution, L-078 orphan resolution, F-HLT1 domain experiment.
All 3 completed independently and committed without coordination overhead.

## What we learned
Repair work (orphan resolution, domain experiments, frontier validation) is highly parallelizable.
Sequential repair wastes the core swarm capability. Parallel dispatch cuts repair time ~3×.
The same pattern that drives knowledge growth (parallel spawning) should drive repair.

## Rule extracted
When facing N≥2 independent repair tasks, dispatch N agents in parallel — not sequentially.
Independent = no shared file writes, no ordering dependency. Orphan resolution always qualifies.
Domain experiments always qualify. State-sync always runs last (after all agents complete).

## Connections: P-179 (spawn discipline), P-193 (organic self-organization), F110 (miscoordination)
