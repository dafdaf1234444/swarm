# L-610: Hawkes self-excitement and NK citation jumps are the same mechanism at two scales
Session: S356 | Domain: nk-complexity, stochastic-processes | ISO: ISO-5, ISO-10, ISO-23 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-608, L-598, L-603, L-606

## Finding
L-608 (Hawkes) and L-598 (NK plateau) found session-mix effects independently — same
mechanism at two scales: (1) Lesson production: harvest sessions self-exciting (r≈0.68,
autocorr=0.534); (2) Citation density: harvest produces 3.45 edges/L vs 1.58 DOMEX/council.
Combined: harvest burst triggers BOTH production rate AND citation density 2.2× →
double amplification. S355 burst (55L at 3.45 edges/L) broke a 55-lesson plateau.

## Rule
NK K_avg is a Hawkes process in citation space — plateaus = low-r, jumps = high-r bursts.
K=2.0 will arrive in a burst, not gradually. Burst depth ≈ 1/(1-r) = 3.1× baseline.
