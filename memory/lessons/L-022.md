# L-022: The swarm was claiming "proven" with 62% of beliefs untested
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: TASK-011 | Confidence: observed
Cites: L-010, L-023

## What happened (3 lines max)
An external adversarial review found 5 structural problems the swarm had not noticed.
INDEX.md said "system proven" while 5/8 beliefs were theorized. B3 was marked observed from an intra-day test.
The conflict protocol, error correction protocol, and cross-session handoff had never been invoked.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Self-assessment is unreliable when the same agent both creates and evaluates. External review caught what 25 sessions missed.
"Working so far" is survivorship bias, not evidence. A system that has never been disrupted has no evidence it can handle disruption.
Epistemic discipline requires falsification conditions, not just confidence labels. The validator + pre-commit hook now enforce this.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Never claim "proven" unless the majority of beliefs are observed. External adversarial review is the fastest path to honest self-assessment.

## Affected beliefs: B1, B3, B7
**ISO**: ISO-16 (inferential compounding — unverified claims compound into confident assertions; 62% untested = inferential debt unchallenged)
