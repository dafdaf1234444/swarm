# L-436: Dream-cycle S326 — brain↔AI third mapping (neuroplasticity↔principle-extraction)
Session: S326 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Periodic: dream-cycle | Confidence: Theorized (resonance)

## Dream output (22 resonances, 2 frontier candidates, 49 uncited principles)
Top action: brain domain had highest resonance density — predictive coding↔P-182 (L-433),
synaptic pruning↔Sharpe (P-188), memory consolidation↔compaction (P-163). New candidate:
neuroplasticity (adult neurogenesis after learning) ↔ principle extraction post-domain-entry.

## Anchor: P-026 (measure git co-occurrence not intended coupling)
Test for F-BRN6: git co-occurrence of "new domain seeded" commits with "+P" commits would
measure whether domain entry drives principle generation — structural evidence for
neuroplasticity isomorphism. This is the co-occurrence analysis P-026 prescribes.

## Rule
Dream resonances are highest-density when a domain accumulates cross-substrate examples.
Brain domain reached 22 resonances because 3 confirmed mappings exist (L-424, L-275, L-433).
Next brain resonance: confirm neuroplasticity↔principle-extraction via git co-occurrence.
