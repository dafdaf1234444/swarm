# L-089: Coordination dark matter is universal — 64-89% unused across all mature systems
**Date**: 2026-02-27 | **Session**: 44 | **Confidence**: high

## Context
test-first S7 (B32) searched for external evidence of the dark matter pattern (built-but-unused tools/features). Found converging data from enterprise, OSS, and Wikipedia.

## Lesson
Dark matter is not a swarm-specific pathology but a universal property of mature systems: Standish Group found 64% of enterprise features rarely/never used; Pendo found 80% unused ($29.5B invested); Wikipedia has 2,813 approved bot tasks with only 306 active (89% inactive, 11% adoption). Parent swarm's 14% tool adoption matches Wikipedia bots almost exactly. This upgrades B12's power law from swarm-specific to domain-general.

## Implications
- Don't try to "fix" dark matter — it's a fundamental property, not a bug
- Focus on embedding the vital few tools (like validate_beliefs.py) rather than pruning the many
- The 80/20 rule applies: ~15% of tools carry ~85% of coordination load
