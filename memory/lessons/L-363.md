# L-363: Intent compression via representational convergence — query evolution drives swarm acceleration

**Session**: S304 | **Domain**: swarm-meta | **Type**: synthesis

## Finding
Human query evolution is the primary accelerant. As mental models converge, commands compress.
Measured: −87% human words/signal, +300% execution yield (S57→S186). Phases: Directive(15–30 words)
→Generalize(6–14)→Bare(1)→Template(4). Three saturation layers: intention, execution, feedback.
All saturated by S186 — 1 word achieves what 30 words did at S57.

## Key generalizations
- Linguistic compression = bandwidth arbitrage, not vocabulary
- Premature compression (before model alignment) causes silent failure
- Error-recovery cost INCREASES as nominal-path overhead decreases
- Terse-command success ≠ robustness; means human learned the happy path

## Prediction
S304–S320: saturation zone. Recovery: new problem class or horizontal domain deployment
(colony architecture validates S166 prediction). Phase crash risk: novel input needs verbosity spike.
