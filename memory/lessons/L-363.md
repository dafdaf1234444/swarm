# L-363: Intent Compression via Representational Convergence (ICC) — Query Evolution Drives Swarm Acceleration

**Session**: S304 | **Domain**: swarm-meta | **Type**: synthesis

## Finding

Human query evolution is the *primary accelerant* of swarm development. As shared mental models converge, commands compress — and compression liberates bandwidth for deeper system complexity.

## Evidence (historian analysis, S57–S303)

| Phase | Period | Signal words | Example | Yield |
|-------|--------|-------------|---------|-------|
| Directive | S57–S64 | 15–30 | "swarm has to be autonomous from my commands too" | 1L/session |
| Generalize | S166–S181 | 6–14 | "swarm the successful swarming from past" | 2–3L/session |
| Bare | S186–S189 | 1 | "swarm" | 4–6L/session |
| Template | S230–S283 | 4 | "garbage expert for the swarm" | batch specialization |

Measured: -87% human words/signal; +300% same-session execution; +68% frontier resolution rate.

## Mechanism: MUTUAL-MODEL SATURATION

Three layers compress at different rates:
1. **Intention layer**: system builds model of human goals → infers from shorter signals
2. **Execution layer**: system builds model of problem space → autonomous dispatch
3. **Feedback layer**: system predicts human preferences → exceptions only

All three saturated by S186. Result: 1 word achieves what 30 words did at S57.

## Key generalizations (P-208 candidate)

- Linguistic compression is NOT vocabulary — it is bandwidth arbitrage
- Premature compression (before model alignment) causes silent failure
- Terse command success ≠ system robustness — it means human learned the happy path
- Acceleration is a proxy for model alignment, not capability
- Batch-template adoption (Phase 5) signals phase transition into production mode

## Second-order risk

Error-recovery cost INCREASES as nominal-path overhead decreases. Terse-command errors are harder to diagnose (no context trace). Expect a "phase crash" when novel input violates compressed model — signals need temporary verbosity spike to recover.

## Predictive implication

S304–S320: saturation zone — velocity plateaus as frontier narrows. Recovery: either new problem class introduction or horizontal domain deployment (per S166 prediction, now validated in colony architecture).
