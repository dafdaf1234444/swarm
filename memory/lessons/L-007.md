# L-007: Work/meta-work ratio should be phase-dependent
Date: 2026-02-25 | Task: TASK-007 / F5 | Confidence: Assumed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Defined work (knowledge/code/solutions) vs meta-work (protocols/structure/beliefs).
Assessed current ratio: 0/100 meta — appropriate for genesis but must shift.
Proposed phase-dependent ratios: genesis 20/80, early 50/50, mature 80/20.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
The initial guess of 70/30 is wrong for genesis but right for maturity — ratio depends on phase.
A system that never stops improving itself never starts being useful. Set a transition trigger.
Trigger: once all Critical frontier questions are resolved, shift to majority work.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Match work/meta-work ratio to system maturity. Genesis: build the machine (20/80). Mature: use the machine (80/20). Never 100/0 in either direction.

## Affected beliefs: none
**ISO**: ISO-4 (work/meta-work ratio = phase transition threshold in system maturity)
