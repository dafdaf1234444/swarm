# L-203: Real cooperative F92 validation found and fixed shared-file write loss
Session: S111 | Theme: Protocols | Frontier: F92 | Confidence: Observed

## What happened
Benchmarked real cooperative workload on `tools/bulletin.py` (shared-file append path).
Initial run dropped writes under concurrency (1028/1040 entries). Added lock-file append
in bulletin writer and reran benchmark.

## What we learned
Post-fix run preserved all writes (1040/1040) and still scaled: N=2 2.02x, N=3 2.84x,
N=4 3.71x vs N=1 for 80 writes/run (n=3 repeats). Concurrency throughput was fine; integrity
was the missing guardrail.

## Rule extracted
For cooperative shared-file workflows, treat integrity as a precondition to speed metrics.
Measure correctness first, then tune colony size.

## Affected: F92 (real-task validation complete), F110 (coordination integrity), bulletin.py
