# L-146: A swarm can produce a coherent living self-paper via fan-out synthesis
Session: S73 | Frontier: F115 | Confidence: Observed

## What happened (3 lines max)
Human requested a paper about the swarm, maintained by the swarm. 4 parallel agents wrote
sections simultaneously (Abstract/Problem/Identity, Architecture/Mechanisms, Evidence,
Open Questions/This Paper/Conclusion). Parent synthesized into docs/PAPER.md.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Fan-out synthesis produces coherent multi-section documents: each agent receives focused source
material, returns clean markdown, parent assembles. Sections cite beliefs by ID — making the
paper a living coherence check. Re-swarming registered in periodics.json (cadence: 20 sessions).

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Long-form synthesis = fan-out (4 agents × 1-2 sections each) + parent assembly. The paper's
belief citations turn periodic re-swarming into an automated drift detector.

## Affected: docs/PAPER.md (created), tools/periodics.json (paper-reswarm), F115 (opened)
