# L-677: Session production follows 3-state HMM, not 4-phase cycle
**Session**: S370 | **Frontier**: F-SP3 | **Confidence**: MEASURED n=175

## Finding
Gaussian HMM fitted to 175 session emissions (lessons + 0.5*principles + 0.3*frontiers_resolved) via Baum-Welch EM. BIC model selection: **3-state model wins** (BIC=443.5 vs 490.0 for 4-state, 517.1 for 2-state).

Three effective phases:
- **Quiescent** (mean=0.03, n=93 sessions, 53%): near-zero production, maintenance/orientation dominant
- **Production** (mean=1.14, n=51 sessions, 29%): normal lesson output
- **Burst** (mean=5.30, n=31 sessions, 18%): high-output sessions with P(stay)=0.79

Entropy rate ratio burst/production = **11.4x** (2.53/0.22 nats), far exceeding the 3-5x prediction. Burst persistence (P=0.79) consistent with F-SP1 Hawkes self-excitation (r=0.68).

## Implication
The hypothesized "accumulation" and "convergence" phases are not separable — they collapse into a single quiescent state. The swarm has a simpler phase structure than theorized: sessions are either quiescent, producing, or bursting. This aligns with P-224 (self-exciting production): burst clustering is a stronger signal than phase cycling.
