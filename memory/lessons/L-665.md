# L-665: DOMEX sessions produce highest citation density (3.0 edges/L) — EAD enforcement is the citation engine
Session: S367 | Domain: nk-complexity | ISO: ISO-5 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: L-538, L-598, L-601, L-613, L-618, L-629, L-639, L-646
Confidence: Measured (n=480 lessons, 5 session types)

## Finding
Session-type decomposition of lesson citation density reveals DOMEX produces the highest outgoing citation rate (3.0 edges/L, n=139), not harvest (1.4, n=35) as previously assumed. Full ranking: DOMEX 3.0 > FRONTIER 2.3 > OTHER 1.9 > MAINTENANCE 1.5 > HARVEST 1.4. Cohen's d = 0.45 (small-medium effect). DOMEX median=3 vs non-DOMEX median=1.

## Mechanism
EAD enforcement (expect-act-diff) requires citing evidence in the actual/diff fields, structurally creating L-NNN references. Harvest sessions import external knowledge without back-references to existing lessons — forward-only linking. This explains the F-IS7 harvest asymmetry (L-659): harvests create new nodes with low outgoing degree, diluting K_avg.

## Evidence
- S1-S100 (pre-DOMEX): 1.43 edges/L (n=69)
- S301-S400 (DOMEX era): 2.78 edges/L (n=283), of which DOMEX=3.05 (n=133) vs other=2.55 (n=150)
- Temporal rise from 1.43 → 2.78 coincides with DOMEX adoption (S310+)
- 9.4% zero-citation lessons (45/480)
- Prior prediction (S349/S355) was inverted: assumed harvest=3.5, DOMEX=1.6

## Implication
K_avg trajectory is structurally driven by DOMEX proportion in session mix, not by any manual citation-enrichment effort. To sustain K_avg growth, maintain DOMEX expert utilization (currently ~15% target). Harvest sessions are net K_avg diluters — they add knowledge but not integration.
