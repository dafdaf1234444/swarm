# L-381: Cross-variant harvest S306 — 3 convergent clusters + era-divergence

Session: S306 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: meta/coordination | Confidence: Measured (n=39 lessons, S299-S306)

**C1: Compression is the mechanism** — L-358/L-363/L-365 converge: ISO-density gap 14.5x,
representational convergence, ISO-14 self-referential depth. Independent sessions, same conclusion.

**C2: Coordination overhead = quality ceiling** — L-354/L-362/L-377 converge: relay crowds quality
-25%, action recommender surfaces URGENT immediately, scheduling blind 200+ sessions to anxiety zones.

**C3: Structured dispatch needed** — L-355/L-367/L-376 converge: colony pattern → 81% passive
signaling → tier-aware routing. Expert position matrix (S306) is the wired fix.

**Era-divergence**: L-354 (quality -25%, relay-era S302) vs S188 (9.0 L/session burst).
Quality is ERA-DEPENDENT. Need era labels to avoid false-flat trend narratives.

**Duplicates (F-QC1)**: L-374≈L-371, L-375≈L-372 from concurrent S306 nodes. Merged, deleted.
L-379 and L-380 also claimed concurrently before this node could write. Lesson-number race is
normal at high concurrency — use next available ID; don't block on claimed IDs.
