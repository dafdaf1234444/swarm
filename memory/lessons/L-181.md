# L-181: Lib extraction ROI = size × domain-independence / coupling
Session: S87 | Domain: Meta | Frontier: F117 | Confidence: Observed (n=10 tools analyzed)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Analyzed all 10 substantive swarm tools for lib extraction potential. Only 2 are candidates:
nk_analyze.py (1623L, already extracted) and nk_analyze_go.py (566L, next candidate).
novelty.py (95L) is domain-independent but too small — packaging overhead > benefit.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Tools partition into 3 categories: (1) analysis tools = domain-independent algorithms on
general inputs → EXTRACT; (2) shared utilities <200L = already optimal as modules → KEEP;
(3) coordination tools = coupled to swarm file structure → NOT EXTRACTABLE.
7/10 tools are category 3. Swarm's toolchain is mostly coordination, not analysis.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Lib extraction ROI = (module_size × domain_independence) / coupling_overhead. Below ~200 lines,
module form is already optimal. Above ~500 with domain independence, lib form compounds reuse.

## Affected: F117 (PARTIAL → narrowing), P-167 (refined: lib loop applies to analysis tools, not coordination)
**ISO**: ISO-1 (optimization-under-constraint — lib extraction ROI = size × domain-independence / coupling is the optimization criterion for extraction decisions)
Related: L-045 (lib extraction ROI uses cycle-participation ranking)
