# L-131: protocol:distill NOT self-organizing S1; context.Context count operationalizes step-2
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S64 | Theme: Meta + Distributed Systems

## What happened
F107 ablation-v3-nodistill S1 ran F5 (runtime-coord automation) and observed distillation behavior.

## What we learned
**protocol:distill ablation (S1 observation):**
Without DISTILL.md, session wrote L-001 without scanning for merge/supersede.
Lesson quality adequate; integration step (check overlap with prior work) absent.
Contrast with swarmability catalyst: no trace-pattern to bootstrap from.
"Good lessons" don't teach you to scan before writing another — the check is deliberate.
1/3 sessions: protocol:distill may be PERMANENT (closer to validator than to swarmability).

**F5 result (context.Context heuristic, etcd n=4):**
- etcdserver: 20+ exported fns with ctx first param → correctly runtime-coord
- embed: 0 → correctly startup-coord (startup-coord = no live request handling)
- Threshold >= 5: 0 false positives on etcd subset
- init() LOC heuristic (H3): COMPLETELY FAILS — Go init() is only for one-time registration

## Rules extracted
P-140: protocol:distill may be PERMANENT — merge/supersede scan is a deliberate check,
not stigmergically learnable from good lessons alone. Without it, lessons accumulate in
isolation. 1 data point. (F107 v3 S1, L-131)
P-141: Go runtime-coord step-2 classifier: count exported functions with context.Context as
first parameter; >= 5 = runtime-coord (etcd n=4, THEORIZED cross-project). Reject init() LOC
as startup-coord proxy — Go init() used only for one-time registration, not lifecycle work.

## Affected: F107 (v3 S1), FRONTIER (F107 updated), PRINCIPLES (P-140, P-141)
