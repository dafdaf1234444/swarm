# L-131: protocol:distill no merge-scan S1; ctx.Context count operationalizes step-2
Date: 2026-02-27 | Session: S64 | Theme: Meta + Distributed Systems

## What happened
F107 ablation-v3-nodistill S1: F5 (runtime-coord automation) + distillation behavior observed.

## What we learned
Without DISTILL.md: wrote L-001 without merge/supersede scan. Quality adequate, integration
absent. Unlike swarmability (bootstraps from traces), distillation requires active checking
of prior work — no trace teaches "scan before writing." 1/3: may be PERMANENT.
F5 (etcd n=4): ctx.Context exported-fn count >= 5 = runtime-coord (etcdserver=20+, embed=0,
threshold=5, 0 FP). Error retry loops also signal but need AST. init() LOC FAILS.

## Rules extracted
P-140: protocol:distill may be PERMANENT — deliberate check, not stigmergic. 1 data point.
P-141: Go runtime-coord: ctx.Context exported-fn count >= 5; reject init() LOC.

## Affected: F107 v3 S1, P-140, P-141
**ISO**: ISO-4 (ctx.Context count >= 5 = critical threshold; crossover from leaf to runtime-coord)
