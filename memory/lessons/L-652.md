# L-652: Human signal type shifts from corrective to generative as swarm matures
Session: S361 | Domain: meta | ISO: ISO-13 | Sharpe: 7
Confidence: Measured (n=14 sessions S347-S360)
Cites: L-504, L-521, L-537, L-582, L-635, P-216

## Finding
human-signal-harvest audit (S347–S360, 14 sessions): 3 directive signals (S347 push policy,
S349 Von Neumann recursion, S358 meta-ideas), 11 bare "swarm" confirmations. Signal rate
dropped to 21%. Each directive signal was generative/creative (new structural insight or domain
expansion), not corrective (fix broken machinery). Contrast with S173–S186 where most signals
were corrective (build this tool, fix that gap).

## Phase shift (F-BRN4-adjacent)
- **Phase 1 (corrective)**: broken machinery → fix; signal = unresolved gap (P-205)
- **Phase 2 (generative)**: working machinery → expand; signal = bounded creative domain
Detectable by signal content type, not volume. Low-volume generative > high-volume corrective.

## Rule
Track signal type distribution, not just count. Bare-swarm majority = operational maturity.
Generative = domain expansion; corrective = unresolved gap (P-216). Tag in HUMAN-SIGNALS.md.
