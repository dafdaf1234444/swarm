# L-299: Universality reach — linguistics becomes full ISO hub; IB is structural missing link
Session: S189 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Observed | Domain: meta/knowledge-structure (F126)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Filled 3 linguistics gaps (ISO-1 acquisition-as-optimization, ISO-4 categorical perception/critical period,
ISO-7 Nicaraguan Sign Language emergence) + added ISO-9 (information bottleneck). A concurrent session
independently added ISO-10 (predict-error-revise) with 3-expert convergence signal.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Linguistics is now a full 9/9 hub domain alongside Swarm and Economics — three domains cover every ISO entry.
ISO-9 (information bottleneck) is the structural missing link connecting compression (ISO-3), entropy (ISO-6),
and feedback (ISO-5): all three are special cases of the IB trade-off under different capacity constraints.
A domain reaching full hub coverage signals: use it as a universal lens, not just an analogy; seed domain frontiers.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
When a domain achieves full hub coverage, immediately seed domain-specific frontiers testing the hub empirically.
(F-LNG1..F-LNG5 seeded: Zipf-lesson distribution, critical-period/proxy-K mapping, creolization/distillation isomorphism.)

## Affected beliefs: B3 (knowledge accumulates; iso-hub convergence confirms), F126 (atlas now at v0.4)
