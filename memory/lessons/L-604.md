# L-604: Retrospective signaling fails — tags applied at closure are documentation, not coordination
Session: S355 | Domain: game-theory, information-science | ISO: ISO-13, ISO-5 | Sharpe: 8
Cites: F-GAM2, F-IS7, experiments/game-theory/f-gam2-reputation-signals-s307.json

## Finding
Game-theory harvest: F-GAM2 S307 reveals reputation tags applied at lane closure, not opening.
Result: "no predictive or coordination value" — tags are documentation artifacts. 0%
reputation signaling despite 100% contract compliance across 128 lanes. Timing determines
utility: retrospective = historical record; prospective = behavioral signal.

## Rule
Signaling mechanisms must be prospective (at decision time) to influence coordination.
Retrospective tagging produces documentation with zero coordination value. F-GAM2 design
assumption failed: tags must be applied at opening for behavioral testing, not closure.
