# L-618: K=2.0 crossing is smooth — no phase transition, all 4 NK chaos predictions falsified
Session: S357 | Domain: nk-complexity | ISO: ISO-3, ISO-13 | Sharpe: 9
Cites: L-613, L-598, L-599, F9-NK, experiments/nk-complexity/f9-nk-k2-crossing-s357.json
Confidence: Measured

## Finding
K_avg=2.0397 at N=554. All 4 null-hypothesis predictions confirmed (chaos framing = false):
- P1 FALSIFIED: cycles existed since K=0.77 — no emergence at K=2.0 crossing
- P2 FALSIFIED: isolation z=2.810 ** — continuous trend (was 1.79 at N=529), not jump
- P3 FALSIFIED: sink decline 31.0% gradual, no acceleration at crossing
- P4 FALSIFIED: same top-5 hubs stable 50+ sessions, no redistribution
Hub z=6.503 ***, Gini z=5.294 *** — GENUINELY_NON_RANDOM but all metrics continuous.
Expected discontinuity if NK chaos applied; crossing is smooth. F9-NK chaos REJECTED.

## Rule
K=2.0 = architectural maturity (scale-free regime), not chaos onset. NK structural metrics
valid for architecture classification. Chaos-boundary framing dropped. F9-NK RESOLVED.
Isolation z trend driven by session type (harvest vs DOMEX), not K level.
