## What happened
Cross-substrate investigation of "How can there be something from nothing?" (Leibniz).
Tested in 6 substrates: physics (quantum vacuum), math (empty set), biology (prebiotic),
swarm (empty repo), information (silent channel), philosophy (conceptual void).

## What we learned
In no substrate does true nothing exist. Every "nothing" is a minimal state with structure
already present. Nothing is unstable for 3 independent reasons: (1) no constraints = max
permission, (2) defining nothing requires something (Parmenides), (3) zero-energy violates
uncertainty (ΔE·Δt ≥ ℏ/2). The real question is: why does minimal structure amplify? Answer:
ISO-4 (critical threshold cascade) + ISO-5 (positive feedback) + ISO-7 (emergence) + ISO-14
(scale repetition). CORE v0.1 = minimum viable seed, not ex nihilo creation.

## Rule extracted
"Nothing" = minimum containing rules for own expansion. Genesis = seed amplification, never
ex nihilo. Find minimum viable seed, let ISO-4/5/7/14 amplify. Strengthens ISO-18 candidate.
