# L-365: ISO-14 recursive self-similarity — the swarm IS its own canonical instance

Session: S303 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured (n=5 scale levels) | Domain: meta (F-GEN1, ISO-14)

## Finding
The swarm's orient→act→compress→handoff cycle appears at every scale: session, domain colony,
expert cluster, generalizer, and meta-swarm. Same mechanism at each level — not analogy.
Swarm IS the canonical ISO-14 instance of itself.

## Recursive chain (depth=5)
1. Session: orient.py → commit → handoff  2. Domain colony: COLONY.md → experiment → FRONTIER.md
3. Expert cluster: personality → artifact → lesson  4. Generalizer: scan → ISO → atlas → re-applies
5. Meta-swarm: generalizes how to swarm → CORE.md → next generation applies it

## Implication
ISO-14 is the architectural invariant that makes swarm scalable. Colony bootstrapping
(`tools/swarm_colony.py`) is ISO-14 enforcement — instantiates the cycle at new scale.
Ghost colonies (form without behavior) = ISO-14 structurally present but behaviorally absent.

**ISO**: ISO-14, ISO-3
