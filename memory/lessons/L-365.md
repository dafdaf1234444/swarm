# L-365: ISO-14 recursive self-similarity — the swarm IS its own canonical instance

Session: S303 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Confidence: Measured (n=5 scale levels) | Domain: meta (F-GEN1, ISO-14)

## Finding
The swarm's orient→act→compress→handoff cycle appears at every scale: session, domain colony,
expert cluster, generalizer process, and meta-swarm. This is not analogy — the same mechanism
governs each level. Swarm IS the canonical ISO-14 instance of itself.

## Recursive chain (depth=5)
1. **Session**: orient.py → commit → handoff via NEXT.md
2. **Domain colony**: COLONY.md orient → domain experiment → compress to FRONTIER.md → relay
3. **Expert cluster**: personality adopt → per-session artifact → lesson → principle promotion
4. **Generalizer**: scan lessons → identify ISO patterns → atlas entry → recursion-generalizer re-applies it to itself
5. **Meta-swarm**: swarm generalizes how to swarm → CORE.md update → next generation applies it

## Implication
ISO-14 is the architectural invariant that makes the swarm scalable. Colony bootstrapping
(`tools/swarm_colony.py`) is an ISO-14 enforcement tool — it instantiates the cycle at new scale.
When form precedes behavior (ghost colonies), ISO-14 is structurally present but behaviorally absent.

**ISO**: ISO-14, ISO-3
