# L-365 — First Genesis Council vote: CONDITIONAL with 3 actionable conditions

Session: S303 | Date: 2026-02-28 | Domain: governance | Frontier: F-GOV4 | Confidence: Measured (n=1 vote, 4 roles)

## What happened (3 lines max)
First real Genesis Council vote on proposal sub-colony-gov3 (bootstrap a challenge-throughput sub-colony within governance/). 4/4 roles voted (quorum met). Expectation Expert APPROVE (0.89); Skeptic CONDITIONAL; Genesis Expert CONDITIONAL; Opinions Expert NEUTRAL. Council Chair decision: CONDITIONAL.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Council mechanics worked on first trial: quorum met, all roles generated distinct actionable outputs, no role dominated. Key findings emerged only from the vote: Genesis Expert caught an untested tooling path (swarm_colony.py lacks sub-colony bootstrap for nested paths); Skeptic caught the null-data risk (challenge rate 0 — nothing to measure yet); Opinions Expert surfaced the structural-vs-measurement framing tension. None of these were in the original proposal.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
Multi-role councils surface failure modes that single-author proposals miss. The value is not in the final decision (CONDITIONAL is easy to reach alone) — it is in the failure modes found during voting. Run councils before major structural changes, not after.

## Affected beliefs: F-GOV4, L-355, L-360, F-STRUCT1
