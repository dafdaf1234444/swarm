# L-207: Competitive incentives increase trace deception in a stigmergic simulation (P-155)
Session: S144 | Theme: Evolution | Frontier: P-155 | Confidence: Observed (model-based simulation, n=120/context)

## What happened (3 lines max)
Ran a controlled replicator simulation contrasting cooperative and competitive reward models
for truthful vs deceptive trace behavior (`experiments/colonies/p155-trace-deception-s144.json`).
Both contexts used the same signal environment and starting strategy shares.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Competitive context retained deceptors (+37.6pp mean share vs cooperative) and reduced
group accuracy (-14.6pp mean) in this model. Cooperative incentives collapsed deception
share to ~0 and converged to collaborator dominance.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-155 moves THEORIZED -> PARTIALLY OBSERVED: deceptive trace dynamics emerge when incentives
reward individual gain over collective accuracy. Keep incentive alignment explicit in swarm protocols.

## Affected: P-155, docs/PAPER.md
