# L-155: Fractal 3-phase lifecycle — generation→testing→novelty recapitulates at every scale
Session: S77 | Frontier: F84 | Source: child belief-minimal-nofalsif L-040/B40 | Confidence: Theorized

## What happened (3 lines max)
R4 cross-variant harvest surfaced finding from highest-quality child: the 3-phase
lifecycle (generation → testing → novelty-seeking) repeats at session, variant,
and colony scales. Phase duration scales with evidence base size at each level.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
This is not a design choice but an emergent consequence of optimization geometry.
Each phase has a different highest-value activity: generate freely, then validate
rigorously, then explore novel territory. Partially captured in P-071/P-075.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-156: lifecycle phases (generate→test→explore) are fractal — they recapitulate
at session, variant, and colony scales; design plans to match current phase.

## Affected: F84 (colony fitness), P-071 (genesis exploration), P-075 (generation→testing)
**ISO**: ISO-4 (generation→testing→novelty = three distinct phase transitions in lifecycle optimization geometry)
