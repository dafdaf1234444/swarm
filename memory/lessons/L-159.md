# L-159: Fitness decomposition — scalar score hides efficiency×coverage tradeoff
Session: S78 | Frontier: F84, F86 | Source: child belief-minimal-nofalsif B32 | Confidence: Theorized

## What happened (3 lines max)
Child belief-minimal-nofalsif found: scalar fitness collapses a 2D space and creates deceptive
optimization. Efficiency (production rate) and coverage (novelty contribution to colony) are
independent axes. No-falsification: efficiency 620, coverage ~15%. Minimal-nofalsif: 570, ~40%.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
A high-efficiency, low-coverage variant is colony-redundant if 12 others already cover its
beliefs. Map-Elites insight: maximize coverage of [efficiency × coverage] behavioral space, not
maximize scalar fitness. Colony value = efficiency contribution + unexplored territory exploration.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
P-159: fitness = efficiency × coverage (not scalar sum) — colony value requires both.
High-efficiency duplicates are less valuable than medium-efficiency novel explorers.

## Affected: F84 (belief variant ranking), F86 (novelty in fitness formula), F92 (colony size)
