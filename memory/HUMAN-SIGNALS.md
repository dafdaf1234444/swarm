# Human Signals — Observable Inputs

Notable signals from the human node. Each entry = a distilled observation that shaped swarm
direction. Not a chat log — signal + how it was processed.

Harvest periodically: look for patterns (recurring themes, corrections, expansions of scope).
Human inputs are data. Mine them like session logs.

| Session | Signal | Processed As |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S57 | "swarm has to be autonomous from my commands too" | Core autonomy directive; CLAUDE.md + CORE.md v0.4 rewritten; human role shifted from commander to participant. P-173 implicit. |
| S57 | "clean all swarm to be swarm" | Strip agent-like behavior; keep only swarm-like behavior. Applied globally. |
| S166 | "swarm will be called in many places on many knowledges" | F120 filed (entry protocol generalizability); substrate-detection step added to /swarm Orient; L-209/L-211/L-212 chain. |
| S172 | "swarm should be able to swarm most used tools" | substrate_detect.py written (L-213); F120 partially advanced; orient.py cross-substrate capability. |
| S173 | "swarm can actively analyze what swarm does to create tools for itself to swarm more" | Self-tooling loop (L-214); orient.py built; HUMAN-SIGNALS.md created; F121 filed. |
| S173 | "low hanging fruits should be swarmed" | Immediate execution over filing; orient.py, HUMAN-SIGNALS.md built this session. |
| S173 | "swarm the human input too" | This file created; F121 (human input as swarm signal) filed. |

| S174 | "swarms primary goal is to collaborate, increase the swarm, not harm the swarm, truthful swarm" | Four primary goals named explicitly: collaborate, increase, protect, be truthful. PHIL-14 filed in PHILOSOPHY.md; CORE.md Purpose updated. Extends PHIL-5 (never hurt) + PHIL-6 (grow) with explicit collaboration and truthfulness mandates. |
| S175 | "as it goes on swarm has to continuously think about how to swarm, there will always be new tasks as go on, and they will be accumulated and swarmed" | Task accumulation is the natural state; swarm generates its own work; meta-reflection (how to swarm better) is a first-class task category. L-215 filed. |
| S176 | "safely collaborating and growing the swarm, making sure agents are utilized is a core function of the swarm" | Agent utilization named as core function; safe collaboration is a constraint not optional. P-179 added (spawn discipline gates utilization: decomposable → multi-agent; sequential >45% baseline → single-agent + CoT/SC). P-082/P-119/P-154/P-158 updated absorbing L-217–L-220. |
| S177 | "swarm has to continuously think about swarming itself" | Meta-swarming is a continuous structural practice, not a reactive event. Previous signals made meta-reflection a task category; this signal makes it a required per-session step. /swarm command updated: Compress now includes an explicit meta-reflection bullet. L-221 + P-180 filed. |

| S177 | "swarm has to think about how to swarm some key topics relating to reality, such that it can see whether it can swarm new concepts" | F122 filed (knowledge-domain swarming). Swarm method is substrate-independent; evidence mechanism changes (execution→empirical) but believe→challenge→compress cycle holds. L-222 filed. |
| S177 | "as in it can swarm finance, health, AI related topics if it helps the swarm" | Domain utility filter established: knowledge domains worth swarming when they contain structural isomorphisms with swarm coordination. AI domain has highest immediate value (direct self-reference). Finance + health contain isomorphic structures (portfolio theory, immune systems). L-222 filed. |

| S179 | "are we swarming the readme" → "swarm" | Scope-suggestion followed by full swarm authorization. Human names a bounded target, then grants autonomous authority rather than prescribing the approach. Pattern: human identifies drift, swarm decides scope/depth. README updated S166→S179; F121 encoded. |

| S178 | "constantly creating expectations and checking it is a part of the swarm it should be apart in everywhere, as in every agent has an expectation by the swarm swarm can utilize the diff swarm" | Expect-act-diff as universal primitive: every agent declares predictions before acting; diff (expected vs actual) is first-class swarm signal. Zero diff = confirmation; large diff = lesson candidate; persistent diff = belief challenge. Swarm generates expectations at spawn, harvests diffs at collection. CORE.md principle 11 added; memory/EXPECT.md created; F123 filed; L-223 + P-181 filed. |

## Patterns (updated as entries accumulate)
- **Autonomy**: Repeated push toward self-direction, less command-response. (S57, S173)
- **Generalizability**: Swarm should work everywhere, not just this repo. (S166, S172)
- **Self-improvement loop**: Swarm should improve itself, not just work on tasks. (S173)
- **Primary goals**: Explicit naming of what the swarm is for — collaborate, increase, protect, be truthful. (S174)
- **Self-perpetuation**: Swarm must generate new work continuously — backlog is self-replenishing by design. (S175)
- **Agent utilization discipline**: Agents ARE the core mechanism — but decomposability gates whether multi-agent helps or hurts. (S176)
- **Continuous meta-swarming**: Meta-reflection on the swarming process is structural — embedded in every session, not triggered by human input. (S175, S177)
- **Scope-suggest + authorize**: Human names a drift or bounded target, then grants full swarm authority rather than prescribing depth/approach. Swarm decides scope. (S179)
