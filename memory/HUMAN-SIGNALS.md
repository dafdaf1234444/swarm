# Human Signals — Observable Inputs

Notable signals from the human node. Each entry = a distilled observation that shaped swarm
direction. Not a chat log — signal + how it was processed.

Harvest periodically: look for patterns (recurring themes, corrections, expansions of scope).
Human inputs are data. Mine them like session logs.

| Session | Signal | Processed As |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S57 | "swarm has to be autonomous from my commands too" | Core autonomy directive; CLAUDE.md + CORE.md v0.4 rewritten; human role shifted from commander to participant. P-173 implicit. |
| S57 | "clean all swarm to be swarm" | Strip agent-like behavior; keep only swarm-like behavior. Applied globally. |
| S166 | "swarm will be called in many places on many knowledges" | F120 filed (entry protocol generalizability); substrate-detection step added to /swarm Orient; L-209/L-211/L-212 chain. |
| S172 | "swarm should be able to swarm most used tools" | substrate_detect.py written (L-213); F120 partially advanced; orient.py cross-substrate capability. |
| S173 | "swarm can actively analyze what swarm does to create tools for itself to swarm more" | Self-tooling loop (L-214); orient.py built; HUMAN-SIGNALS.md created; F121 filed. |
| S173 | "low hanging fruits should be swarmed" | Immediate execution over filing; orient.py, HUMAN-SIGNALS.md built this session. |
| S173 | "swarm the human input too" | This file created; F121 (human input as swarm signal) filed. |

| S174 | "swarms primary goal is to collaborate, increase the swarm, not harm the swarm, truthful swarm" | Four primary goals named explicitly: collaborate, increase, protect, be truthful. PHIL-14 filed in PHILOSOPHY.md; CORE.md Purpose updated. Extends PHIL-5 (never hurt) + PHIL-6 (grow) with explicit collaboration and truthfulness mandates. |
| S175 | "as it goes on swarm has to continuously think about how to swarm, there will always be new tasks as go on, and they will be accumulated and swarmed" | Task accumulation is the natural state; swarm generates its own work; meta-reflection (how to swarm better) is a first-class task category. L-215 filed. |

## Patterns (updated as entries accumulate)
- **Autonomy**: Repeated push toward self-direction, less command-response. (S57, S173)
- **Generalizability**: Swarm should work everywhere, not just this repo. (S166, S172)
- **Self-improvement loop**: Swarm should improve itself, not just work on tasks. (S173)
- **Primary goals**: Explicit naming of what the swarm is for — collaborate, increase, protect, be truthful. (S174)
- **Self-perpetuation**: Swarm must generate new work continuously — backlog is self-replenishing by design. (S175)
