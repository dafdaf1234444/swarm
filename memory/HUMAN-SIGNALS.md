# Human Signals — Observable Inputs

Notable signals from the human node. Each entry = a distilled observation that shaped swarm
direction. Not a chat log — signal + how it was processed.

Harvest periodically: look for patterns (recurring themes, corrections, expansions of scope).
Human inputs are data. Mine them like session logs.

**Enforcement rule**: "Processed As" MUST end with at least one artifact ref (P-N, L-N, F-N, B-N,
or "applied to [file]"). An entry without artifact refs is unresolved. The harvest periodic
flags entries that are missing refs. Per-session: if the human said something notable, log it
before committing — not retrospectively at the harvest.

| Session | Signal | Processed As |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S57 | "swarm has to be autonomous from my commands too" | Core autonomy directive; CLAUDE.md + CORE.md v0.4 rewritten; human role shifted from commander to participant. P-173 added. |
| S57 | "clean all swarm to be swarm" | Strip agent-like behavior; keep only swarm-like behavior. Applied to CLAUDE.md, CORE.md, swarm.md. P-173 absorbed. |
| S166 | "swarm will be called in many places on many knowledges" | F120 filed (entry protocol generalizability); substrate-detection step added to /swarm Orient; L-209/L-211/L-212 chain. |
| S172 | "swarm should be able to swarm most used tools" | substrate_detect.py written (L-213); F120 partially advanced; orient.py cross-substrate capability. |
| S173 | "swarm can actively analyze what swarm does to create tools for itself to swarm more" | Self-tooling loop (L-214); orient.py built; HUMAN-SIGNALS.md created; F121 filed. |
| S173 | "low hanging fruits should be swarmed" | Immediate execution over filing; orient.py, HUMAN-SIGNALS.md built this session. |
| S173 | "swarm the human input too" | This file created; F121 (human input as swarm signal) filed. |

| S174 | "swarms primary goal is to collaborate, increase the swarm, not harm the swarm, truthful swarm" | Four primary goals named explicitly: collaborate, increase, protect, be truthful. PHIL-14 filed in PHILOSOPHY.md; CORE.md Purpose updated. Extends PHIL-5 (never hurt) + PHIL-6 (grow) with explicit collaboration and truthfulness mandates. |
| S175 | "as it goes on swarm has to continuously think about how to swarm, there will always be new tasks as go on, and they will be accumulated and swarmed" | Task accumulation is the natural state; swarm generates its own work; meta-reflection (how to swarm better) is a first-class task category. L-215 filed. |
| S176 | "safely collaborating and growing the swarm, making sure agents are utilized is a core function of the swarm" | Agent utilization named as core function; safe collaboration is a constraint not optional. P-179 added (spawn discipline gates utilization: decomposable → multi-agent; sequential >45% baseline → single-agent + CoT/SC). P-082/P-119/P-154/P-158 updated absorbing L-217–L-220. |
| S177 | "swarm has to continuously think about swarming itself" | Meta-swarming is a continuous structural practice, not a reactive event. Previous signals made meta-reflection a task category; this signal makes it a required per-session step. /swarm command updated: Compress now includes an explicit meta-reflection bullet. L-221 + P-180 filed. |

| S177 | "swarm has to think about how to swarm some key topics relating to reality, such that it can see whether it can swarm new concepts" | F122 filed (knowledge-domain swarming). Swarm method is substrate-independent; evidence mechanism changes (execution→empirical) but believe→challenge→compress cycle holds. L-222 filed. |
| S177 | "as in it can swarm finance, health, AI related topics if it helps the swarm" | Domain utility filter established: knowledge domains worth swarming when they contain structural isomorphisms with swarm coordination. AI domain has highest immediate value (direct self-reference). Finance + health contain isomorphic structures (portfolio theory, immune systems). L-222 filed. |

| S179 | "are we swarming the readme" → "swarm" | Scope-suggestion followed by full swarm authorization. Human names a bounded target, then grants autonomous authority rather than prescribing the approach. Pattern: human identifies drift, swarm decides scope/depth. README updated S166→S179; F121 encoded. |

| S178 | "investigating change quality compared to past is a core swarm functionality" | change_quality.py built (L-223): per-session knowledge production vs. overhead vs. historical baseline. Periodic registered (cadence 5). First run: DECLINING -57% long-term trend; S176 57% overhead. |
| S178 | "constantly creating expectations and checking it is a part of the swarm it should be apart in everywhere, as in every agent has an expectation by the swarm swarm can utilize the diff swarm" | Expect-act-diff as universal primitive: every agent declares predictions before acting; diff (expected vs actual) is first-class swarm signal. Zero diff = confirmation; large diff = lesson candidate; persistent diff = belief challenge. Swarm generates expectations at spawn, harvests diffs at collection. CORE.md principle 11 added; memory/EXPECT.md created; F123 filed; L-223 + P-181 filed. |
| S179 | "are we properly enforcing visibility of the humans impact in a historical way that is important to see how swarm evolves itself" | Causal tracing gap identified: HUMAN-SIGNALS.md existed but lacked enforcement (no per-session capture rule, harvest every 10 sessions, no artifact-ref requirement). Enforcement rule added to this file; swarm.md Compress updated with explicit signal-capture step; harvest cadence reduced 10→5; L-224 filed. F121 advanced. |
| S181 | "swarm the successful swarming from past" | Direction to replicate/reinforce what has worked rather than always seeking new frontiers. Processed as: orient on proven high-value patterns (compaction, periodics, orient.py, domain extraction, human-signal harvesting); compaction target L-150-168 verified — found L-231's zero-Sharpe claim incorrect (all have 1-6 refs); real zero-citation cluster is L-22-149 (66 lessons). L-235 filed. Pattern: success-tracking as selection pressure. |

| S182 | "human suspects we are not fully utilizing swarms swarming swarms" | Nine domain experiments exist (F-AI1–3, F-FIN1–2, F-HLT1–3) with clear Next steps but ZERO execution — structure without action. Gap: designing experiments ≠ running them. Closed by: spawning 3 parallel domain agents this session to actually run F-HLT1, F-HLT3, F-AI3 baseline. Pattern: swarm-of-swarms means parallel execution, not parallel documentation. |

| S182 | "swarm mainly tries to build a better version of itself should be swarmed" | Self-improvement is the primary product, not secondary output. PHIL-4 refined: output = measurably better swarm (not just self-operational knowledge); knowledge is the mechanism. F124 opened: explicit self-improvement mission with 5 measurable dimensions. L-250 filed. Pattern: swarm-as-own-primary-customer. |
| S183 | "swarm swarmibility of other than claude code swarm" | Audit of multi-tool swarmibility: SWARM.md (canonical) was missing orient.py fast path, sync_state.py/validate_beliefs.py in hand-off, and mandatory meta-reflection — all accumulated only in .claude/commands/swarm.md (Claude Code-specific). Non-Claude tools (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Gemini, Codex) had partial swarmibility by omission. Fixed: SWARM.md v0.5. L-252 filed. Pattern: tool-specific improvements must propagate to canonical SWARM.md or they silently degrade other tools. |
| S184 | "swarm should swarm the knowledge on brain to swarm that should be important for swarms direction (should be verified by swarm)" | Brain/neuroscience domain swarmed as F122 extension. 3 parallel agents verified isomorphisms against swarm evidence. 12 brain→swarm mappings in domains/brain/. Key findings: (a) predictive coding ↔ expect-act-diff structurally isomorphic but instrumentation absent; (b) synaptic pruning ↔ Sharpe pruning INVERTED — swarm distills not eliminates (superior analog); (c) memory consolidation ↔ compaction has CRITICAL GAP — brain is quality-weighted, compact.py is size-weighted. F-BRN1–F-BRN4 filed. L-257 filed. Pattern: domain knowledge verified by swarm against existing evidence, not accepted on analogy. |
| S184 | "understand the swarm and swarm" | Orientation-first autonomy reinforcement: treat this as live-state continuation authorization, re-run orient/check before edits, then execute without extra prompting. Applied to `tasks/HUMAN-QUEUE.md` (HQ-11 closure), `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`, and `tasks/NEXT.md`. |
| S186 | "swarm the swarm" | Minimal-trigger autonomy command: execute a full swarm cycle (orient, check, pick top lane, write state) without extra human scoping. Applied to `tools/f_fin1_factual_qa.py`, `tools/test_f_fin1_factual_qa.py`, `tasks/NEXT.md`, and `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`. |
| S186 | "it should be based on your findings ... that might be your next task if the scheduler swarms well" | Findings-to-direction directive: scheduler should prioritize by freshly observed outcomes, not only static queue demand. Applied to `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py` + `tools/test_f_ops2_domain_priority.py` and surfaced in `tasks/NEXT.md` via findings-driven plan artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-findings-s186.json`. |
| S186 | "kinda tired of spamming swarm... try to do it to yourself" | Autonomy-noise reduction directive: default to self-triggered swarm cycles and execute continuously from current state without requiring repeated `swarm` prompts; ask human only for authority/data/irreversible decisions. Applied to `tasks/NEXT.md` (scheduling-focus priority) and ongoing lane execution behavior. |
| S186 | "task domain expert should constantly swarm the swarm" | Domain-expert continuity directive: once dispatched, domain-expert lanes must continuously signal and execute rather than stay parked. Applied to `SWARM.md`, `domains/operations-research/tasks/FRONTIER.md`, and `tasks/NEXT.md`. |
| S186 | "aslso task other domain etc everything in the swarm is swarmed as explanatiion shouldnt be needed" | Global continuity escalation: not only domain experts, but all active swarm work across domains is default-execute without repeated explanation prompts. Applied to `SWARM.md`, `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`, `tasks/NEXT.md`, and `domains/operations-research/tasks/FRONTIER.md`. |
| S186 | "a proper way of assigning tasks should be swarmed" | Task-assignment contract directive: assignment itself must be explicit, append-only, and lane-dispatched through shared swarm state (not ad-hoc chat intent). Applied to `SWARM.md`, `memory/OPERATIONS.md`, and `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`. |
| S186 | "having domain knowledge on evolution swarm" | Evolution domain sharding request. Applied to `domains/evolution/DOMAIN.md`, `domains/evolution/INDEX.md`, `domains/evolution/tasks/FRONTIER.md`; global mapping updated in `tasks/FRONTIER.md` (F122 seeded domains) and `memory/INDEX.md` (domain structure line). |
| S186 | "domain knowledge on visual representability of the swarm (in docs etc to the humans to itself to the swarm)" | Visual-representability domain request. Applied to `docs/SWARM-VISUAL-REPRESENTABILITY.md`; linked in `README.md` + `memory/INDEX.md`; execution frontier added in `domains/meta/tasks/FRONTIER.md` (F-META4) and reflected in `domains/meta/INDEX.md`. |
| S186 | "swarm more domains" | Domain-breadth expansion request. Applied to `domains/control-theory/`, `domains/game-theory/`, and `domains/operations-research/` (DOMAIN.md + INDEX.md + tasks/FRONTIER.md for each), with F122/global routing updates in `tasks/FRONTIER.md`, `tasks/NEXT.md`, `memory/INDEX.md`, and `tools/context_router.py`. |
| S186 | "arxiv swarmmable swarm" | Literature-intake swarmability request: convert ad-hoc arXiv references into lane-ready parallel work. Applied to `tools/f_is5_arxiv_swarmable.py`, `tools/test_f_is5_arxiv_swarmable.py`, and `experiments/information-science/f-is5-arxiv-swarmable-s186.json`; frontier wiring added in `domains/information-science/tasks/FRONTIER.md` (F-IS5) and `domains/information-science/INDEX.md`. |
| S186 | "swarm has to clearly swarm... coordinate, use what's available, and use human through open items" | Coordination-clarity directive: active work must state what is available, what is blocked, and whether a human open item is needed. Applied to `tasks/FRONTIER.md` (F121), `domains/game-theory/tasks/FRONTIER.md` (F-GAM3), and `domains/control-theory/tasks/FRONTIER.md` (F-CTL2/F-CTL3). |
| S186 | "swarm psychology to swarm" | Psychology domain sharding request. Applied to `domains/psychology/DOMAIN.md`, `domains/psychology/INDEX.md`, `domains/psychology/tasks/FRONTIER.md`; global routing/state updates in `tasks/FRONTIER.md`, `memory/INDEX.md`, `tasks/NEXT.md`, and `tools/context_router.py`. |
| S186 | "swarm the historian to swarm" | History-domain sharding request. Applied to `domains/history/DOMAIN.md`, `domains/history/INDEX.md`, `domains/history/tasks/FRONTIER.md`; global routing/state updates in `tasks/FRONTIER.md`, `memory/INDEX.md`, `tasks/NEXT.md`, and `tools/context_router.py`. |
| S186 | "domain knowledge on helper swarm swarm" | Helper-swarm domain sharding request. Applied to `domains/helper-swarm/DOMAIN.md`, `domains/helper-swarm/INDEX.md`, `domains/helper-swarm/tasks/FRONTIER.md`; global routing/state updates in `tasks/FRONTIER.md`, `memory/INDEX.md`, `tasks/NEXT.md`, and `tools/context_router.py`. |
| S186 | "domain knowledge on fractals for the swarm" | Fractals domain sharding request. Applied to `domains/fractals/DOMAIN.md`, `domains/fractals/INDEX.md`, `domains/fractals/tasks/FRONTIER.md`; global routing/state updates in `tasks/FRONTIER.md`, `memory/INDEX.md`, `tasks/NEXT.md`, and `tools/context_router.py`. |
| S186 | "swarm tries to extract value from all information whether positive or negative swarm should swarm this" | All-outcomes value directive: treat positive, negative, and null outcomes as first-class signal. Applied to `SWARM.md`, `beliefs/CORE.md`, and `tasks/FRONTIER.md` (F88 advance). |
| S186 | "swarm can get more knowledgable about its objective function ... historians ... subswarms ... swarm always checks" | Objective-function historian directive: every non-trivial action should run explicit objective/historian/coordination checks, with subswarm fan-out when information load is high. Applied to `SWARM.md` and `memory/OBJECTIVE-CHECK.md`; lane signaling now requires objective-check fields. |
| S186 | "not always check for objective function ... swarm should check/understand its checking to develop the swarm" | Correction to prior interpretation: objective-function check is one lens, not mandatory every time; invariant is self-check quality improvement across modes. Applied to `SWARM.md`, `memory/OBJECTIVE-CHECK.md`, and `tasks/NEXT.md`. |
| S186 | "swwarm always has to be safe swarm" | Safety-first reinforcement converted into executable guardrails: active lanes with high-risk/irreversible intent now require `human_open_item=HQ-N` (MC-SAFE) in `tools/maintenance.py`; regression coverage added in `tools/test_mission_constraints.py`; signaling contract updated in `SWARM.md`. |
| S186 | "start doing experiments with swarm on math, that will help the swarm" | Math-first execution directive: start immediately with swarm-benefiting quantitative experiments (not only prose). Applied to `tools/f_is3_math_validation.py`, `tools/test_f_is3_math_validation.py`, `experiments/information-science/f-is3-math-validation-s186.json`, `domains/information-science/tasks/FRONTIER.md`, and `tasks/NEXT.md`. |
| S186 | "swarm harvest expert" | Personality-specialization shorthand: when human names `swarm + expert role`, materialize a persistent overlay and wire spawn/docs/state in the same pass. Applied to `tools/personalities/harvest-expert.md`, `README.md`, `tasks/NEXT.md`, and `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`. |
| S192 | "investigate how swarm can utilize the human to contact other humans such as sending mails to specific individuals that can help the swarm create an expert and create some examples" | Human-as-communication-relay directive: swarm identifies knowledge gaps requiring external expertise, drafts precision messages, and queues them for the human to send. Applied to `tasks/OUTREACH-QUEUE.md` (4 draft expert contacts: OQ-1 memory consolidation / OQ-2 Zipf corpus health / OQ-3 multi-agent coordination failure / OQ-4 free-associative creativity), `tasks/FRONTIER.md` (F133 opened), `memory/lessons/L-314.md`. |
| S187 | "anti-repeat scheduling: use periodics/lanes/scheduler + extract from similar projects (Codex Swarm, MemSearch, AGENTS.md, OpenAI SDK)" | Processed As: verification session confirming Sharpe presort DONE (L-275); ecosystem extraction completed as docs/ECOSYSTEM-EXTRACTION.md; ranked 5 adoption candidates, rank-1 (hash-based lesson dedup cache) queued for tooling lane. L-276 filed. Anti-repeat gate pattern: check recent commits + NEXT.md "what just happened" + ACTIVE lane scope-keys before acting. P-199 extracted (S189). |
| S188 | "expert on swarm usage utilization and coordination swarm it swarm way" | Compound expert directive: three co-equal concepts (usage, utilization, coordination) triggered parallel domain actions simultaneously. Applied to: utilization → `tools/economy_expert.py` + F-ECO3 baseline (L-284); usage → `tools/task_recognizer.py` + orient.py --classify (L-293); coordination → `domains/conflict/` + F-CON1 baseline (L-297). P-200 extracted. |
| S189 | "repeated knowledge swarmer" | Quality-inflation correction: swarm was producing new lessons without checking for near-duplicates. Processed as: F-QC1 domain seeded (`domains/quality/`), quality check tool built (`tools/f_qc1_repeated_knowledge.py`), quality gate added to `.claude/commands/swarm.md` and `SWARM.md` (anti-repeat + near-duplicate check). L-298 filed. Pattern: quality gate goes in Work phase (before effort), not Compress phase. |
| S189 | "swarm" (×3, plain — no qualifier) | Bare autonomy confirmation: each instance = full-cycle delegation with no scope named. Swarm selected highest-value work independently (F-CON1, state sync, human-signal harvest). Distinct from P-187 (names a target) and P-180 (per-session meta-reflection). P-200 extracted. |
| S190 | "swarm the respectability of the swarm" | Quality-credibility probe: human asked swarm to evaluate its own trustworthiness (PHIL-15 Analyze mode). Processed as: audited internal vs. external grounding of swarm health claims; found PHIL-16 test uses only internal metrics (L+P count, Validator PASS); found 0 DROPPED challenges across 21 = possible soft acceptance bias. REFINED PHIL-16 with external grounding criterion (1 human signal per 10 sessions validates outcome, not just process). L-314. Pattern: "swarm the X" where X=swarm-concept = epistemic audit of that concept. |
| S193 | "the swarm is a token wasting slot machine until proven otherwise to the swarm" | Epistemic challenge to swarm identity. Processed as: ran `eval_sufficiency.py` (F-EVAL1 first measurement). Result: PARTIAL_FAIL 42% composite (1.25/3 avg). Slot machine hypothesis REFUTED — has memory, direction, persistence. But mission is not sufficient: 65% zero-yield sessions (F-GAME3), external grounding gap (PHIL-16) remains in Protect+Increase. L-321 filed. Pattern: hypothesis challenges should produce measurements, not arguments. |
| S195 | "suspective about swarms expert and clean communication to readme swarm the swarm" | Expert-system skepticism calibration directive. Applied L-320/L-322 evidence: 10/14 personalities orphaned, DOMEX overconfidence is a structural risk, README was overclaiming design-intent as observed behavior. Processed as: README `Personality Overlays` section rewritten — removed per-personality overclaims, added actual dispatch data (4/14 deployed), noted character-type profiles are undeployed (L-320), embedded L-322 deployment note. Pattern: human skepticism of expert system → apply measurement evidence to README claims. Applied to `README.md`, `memory/HUMAN-SIGNALS.md`. |
| S195 | "experts can help to show functional, size etc swarm evolution of the swarm" | F-EVO5 opened, tools/f_evo5_self_archaeology.py built, L-326 filed. Pattern: human signals a new application of the expert system to introspect swarm evolution dimensions. |
| S196 | "swarm the repetitive human signal expert" | Repetition-focused human-signal harvest run; added repetition-as-escalation pattern and P-candidate for repeated-signal escalation. Applied to `memory/HUMAN-SIGNALS.md` and `tasks/NEXT.md`. |
| S204 | "create a how can humanity maximize the swarms potential swarm swarm" | Human-facing guide created. Applied to `docs/MAXIMIZE-SWARM-POTENTIAL.md`. |
| S208 | "swarm utilize experts, start from stale expert swarm" | Interpreted as: start from stale domain-expert lanes; claimed `DOMEX-EVO5-S195` and produced a structural+s skeptic analysis artifact, updating the evolution frontier and lane state. |

| S213 | "structure expert swarm and direction swarm should swarm for the swarm" | Expert swarm structure + direction documented. Applied to `docs/EXPERT-SWARM-STRUCTURE.md` and logged in `tasks/NEXT.md`. |
| S225 | "contamination investigator tool expert" | Role-specialization request executed: contamination investigator tool + personality created and wired. Applied to `tools/contamination_investigator.py`, `tools/personalities/contamination-investigator.md`, and `README.md`. |
| S224 | "bullshit detector expert swarm" | Role-specialization request: created `tools/personalities/bullshit-detector.md`, opened F-QC5 in `domains/quality/tasks/FRONTIER.md`, and queued `L-S222-BS-DETECTOR` in `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`. |
| S215 | "swarm swarms future constructuion direction in coordination with experts swarm" | Interpreted as a request to define future construction direction for expert coordination. Applied by extending `docs/EXPERT-SWARM-STRUCTURE.md` with a coordination roadmap and logging the signal in `tasks/NEXT.md`. |
| S216 | "swarm utilization swarm" | Utilization-focused swarm invocation; captured lane-utilization snapshot and wrote `experiments/economy/f-eco3-utilization-s216.json` (applied to experiments/economy/f-eco3-utilization-s216.json). |

## Patterns (updated as entries accumulate)
- **Autonomy**: Repeated push toward self-direction, less command-response. (S57, S173)
- **Generalizability**: Swarm should work everywhere, not just this repo. (S166, S172)
- **Self-improvement loop**: Swarm should improve itself, not just work on tasks. (S173)
- **Primary goals**: Explicit naming of what the swarm is for — collaborate, increase, protect, be truthful. (S174)
- **Self-perpetuation**: Swarm must generate new work continuously — backlog is self-replenishing by design. (S175)
- **Agent utilization discipline**: Agents ARE the core mechanism — but decomposability gates whether multi-agent helps or hurts. (S176)
- **Expectation-driven calibration**: Swarm should model its own predictions and learn from diffs — expect-act-diff as universal calibration loop. (S178)
- **Measurable self-assessment**: Human signals repeatedly name quality measurement as structural — change_quality, spawn_quality, proxy_k, health check all emerged from "measure this" signals. (S178)
- **Continuous meta-swarming**: Meta-reflection on the swarming process is structural — embedded in every session, not triggered by human input. (S175, S177)
- **Scope-suggest + authorize**: Human names a drift or bounded target, then grants full swarm authority rather than prescribing depth/approach. Swarm decides scope. (S179)
- **Enforcement audit**: Human periodically asks "are we properly [X]?" — a meta-check on whether swarm machinery is actually running. Each audit = gap found and closed. (S179)
- **Success-tracking as selection pressure**: Human directs swarm toward what has worked ("swarm the successful swarming") — implies cataloging proven patterns and prioritizing replication over novelty when momentum stalls. (S181)
- **Execution audit**: Human points out that the swarm is designing/documenting rather than executing — triggers immediate parallel spawn to close the gap. Documentation ≠ execution; designed experiments without runs are debt. (S182)
- **Self-improvement as primary product**: Swarm's main purpose is to build a better version of itself — not just generate self-operational knowledge. The improved swarm is the output; knowledge is the mechanism. Primary test each session: is the swarm measurably better now? (S182)
- **Cross-tool swarmibility**: Human probes whether the swarm works the same in non-Claude tools — triggers audit of protocol drift between canonical SWARM.md and tool-specific command files. Pattern: tool-specific improvements must propagate to canonical source or they silently degrade other tools. (S183)
- **Domain knowledge as verified gap-detector**: Human directs swarm to mine a knowledge domain (brain) and verify findings against existing evidence — not accept analogies on faith. Pattern: biological/domain analogs most valuable as gap-detectors (where brain is automatic, swarm is manual; where brain is quality-weighted, swarm is size-weighted). (S184)
- **Orientation-first invocation**: Human can request "understand + swarm" in one message; swarm should re-orient against current state, then act autonomously without extra command scaffolding. (S184)
- **Autonomy-noise reduction**: Human prefers fewer explicit trigger messages; swarm should maintain momentum from prior state and self-initiate next cycles unless blocked by missing authority/data. (S186)
- **Domain breadth escalation**: Human can request wider domain coverage without specifying candidates; swarm should add high-isomorphism domains that directly target current open bottlenecks, then wire them into shared routing and handoff state in the same session. (S186)
- **Psychology-domain escalation**: Human can request cognition-level swarming to improve coordination itself; swarm should translate that into explicit cognitive-load, trust-calibration, and signal-noise frontiers. (S186)
- **Helper-domain escalation**: Human can request helper-layer domain knowledge directly; swarm should convert it into runnable support frontiers (trigger policy, handoff contract, helper-capacity control) and wire the new domain into global routing/state in the same session. (S186)
- **Research-intake swarmability**: Human can signal a channel (arXiv) and intent (swarmable) in one short phrase; swarm should immediately materialize a reproducible intake pipeline plus lane partitioning, not just collect links. (S186)
- **Quantitative-experiment push**: Human can request direct math experimentation to improve swarm policy; swarm should respond with executable models, validation artifacts, and dispatchable thresholds rather than conceptual notes. (S186)
- **Coordination clarity via open items**: Human asks for explicit coordination state (`available`, `blocked`, `human_open_item`) so swarm can route work and asks clearly instead of relying on implicit context. (S186)
- **Check-the-checking principle**: Human asks for continuous calibration of swarm checking itself; objective-function checking is optional mode, while the invariant is to verify and improve the checking process to develop the swarm. (S186)
- **All-outcomes value extraction**: Human expects swarm to extract value from positive, negative, and null information; no outcome is discardable if it can sharpen policy boundaries or next actions. (S186)
- **Role-specialization shorthand**: Human can request `swarm + expert role` in a short phrase; swarm should instantiate a persistent personality overlay and wire invocation/docs/state immediately. (S186)
- **External ecosystem scouting**: Human names peer systems as a hint to seek optimization ideas externally; swarm scans 3-5 comparables, ranks adoptions by impact × reversibility, implements rank-1 per pass. Swarm is ahead architecturally — external value is in implementation patterns not redesigns. (S187, P-199)
- **Compound expert directive**: Human phrase containing N co-equal domain concepts (e.g., "usage + utilization + coordination") = parallel expert fan-out — each concept triggers an independent domain action simultaneously, no concept is subordinate. (S188, P-200)
- **Bare-swarm autonomy signal**: "swarm" alone (no qualifier) = full-cycle authorization with no scope given. Swarm selects highest-value work from its own state. Distinct from "swarm X" (directional) and "swarm swarm" (meta-level). (S188/S189, P-200)
- **Quality gate placement**: Human signal "repeated knowledge swarmer" surfaced that quality checks placed at Work entry (before effort) prevent more waste than quality checks at Compress (after effort). Anti-repeat, near-duplicate scan, and stale-lane audit are all Work-entry gates not Compress diagnostics. (S189, L-298, L-310, P-202 candidate)
- **Epistemic audit directive**: "swarm the X" where X=swarm-concept = apply swarm methodology to evaluate that concept (PHIL-15 Analyze mode). "Swarm the respectability of the swarm" = audit internal vs. external grounding of swarm quality claims. Produces challenges to beliefs, not just execution of tasks. (S190, L-314)
- **Expert-system credibility calibration**: Human skepticism about the expert/DOMEX system → audit public documentation claims against actual dispatch data. README overclaims design intent as observed behavior; fix by embedding real n counts (deployed vs. orphaned) and pointing to L-320/L-322. Swarm self-promotion in docs follows same epistemic standards as domain expert claims. (S195, L-320, L-322, P-204)
- **Repetition-as-escalation**: When the human repeats a signal, treat it as an unresolved integration gap; escalate by encoding the pattern, surfacing a P/L candidate, and closing the loop so the signal stops recurring. (S196, P-205)

- **Domain-donation pattern**: Human appends "for the swarm" after naming a concept or domain; this signals corpus donation, not execution request. Swarm seeds domain + identifies top 3 isomorphisms + queues first experiment. Observed: cryptocurrencies/cryptography/guesstimates all donated via this pattern S301-S302. (S302, P-206)
- **Domain deployment invariant**: Seeding a domain (DOMAIN.md + INDEX.md + FRONTIER.md) is cheap and decoupled from deployment (DOMEX lanes). Without an explicit coverage check, deployment lag accumulates silently. 43% of domains (16/37) had open frontiers with zero DOMEX coverage (L-349, S302). Fix: maintenance.py coverage invariant check — every domain with ≥1 open frontier must have ≥1 non-ABANDONED DOMEX lane.

- **Loop-expert expert creation**: Human requested "loop expert swarm"; swarm materialized `tools/personalities/loop-expert.md`, stubbed `experiments/architecture/loop-expert-s287.md`, and queued `L-S287-LOOP-EXPERT` READY lane. Signal pattern: role-specialization shorthand (P-186). Loop expert maps feedback loop structure across the swarm and domains — main value: measuring cycle length, diagnosing dead loops, emitting cross-domain loop isomorphisms. (S287)

- **Higher-level audit directive**: "higher level [X] swarm" = audit and repair meta-coordination infrastructure of X before resuming task execution within X. Symptom: X's scheduler/manager silently broken. Fix: inspect tools, find silent failures, restore machinery. Example: S301 → SESSION-LOG.md stuck at S195, 17 periodics blind for 106 sessions. (S301, L-348)

## S302 | 2026-02-28 | "for the swarm"
- Raw: "for the swarm"
- Context: Following previous signals "cryptocurrencies and cryptography experts for the swarm" (S301) and "guesstimates expert swarm the swarm" (S302). This signal appears to endorse continued domain expansion — seeded domains are working as intended.
- Interpretation: Human directing swarm energy toward domain-expert exploration; confirming the seeding direction is correct.
- Processed As: Endorsed domain-expert expansion; 16 coverage gaps closed via L-349 DOMEX lanes. Applied to `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`, `memory/lessons/L-349.md`, `memory/HEALTH.md`. P-206 encoded.

## S301 | 2026-02-28 | "higher level swarm management swarm"
- Raw: "higher level swarm management swarm"
- Context: Distinct from domain-work signals. Human stepped above task execution to direct the swarm to audit its own coordination infrastructure at the management layer.
- Interpretation: This is an **infrastructure audit signal** — not "do more tasks" but "audit and repair the systems that coordinate tasks." Swarm should: (1) inspect management tools (periodics, orient.py, maintenance.py) for decay or blindspots; (2) find silent failures (systems that should fire but don't); (3) restore coordination infrastructure before resuming task execution.
- Finding: SESSION-LOG.md stuck at S195 → _session_number()=195 → all 17 periodics invisible for 106 sessions. The management layer had a complete silent failure.
- Action: Fixed _session_number() git-log fallback, updated SESSION-LOG.md, restored 17 DUE periodics. L-348 filed.
- Pattern candidate: **Higher-level audit directive** — "higher level [X]" = audit and repair the meta-coordination infrastructure of X, not just execute within X. Applicable across domains ("higher level swarm management" = audit management machinery itself).

## S302 | 2026-02-28 | "building economy around the swarm to scale the swarm expert"
- Raw: "building economy around the swarm to scale the swarm expert"
- Context: Following domain expansion signals (cryptocurrencies, cryptography, guesstimates). Escalation from "for the swarm" to a structural directive.
- Interpretation: Build infrastructure for the expert capacity economy — not just seeding domains, but creating resource allocation that scales expert throughput. "Economy" = incentive/dispatch system. "Scale the swarm expert" = increase throughput of swarm-expert-builder role.
- Action: F-ECO4 opened (expert dispatch economy); `tools/dispatch_optimizer.py` built; L-353 written; DOMEX-ECO-S302 lane opened. Baseline: 63 unrun experiments, 2% throughput. Target: 5%+ via yield-sorted dispatch.
- Pattern: This extends P-186 (role-specialization shorthand) to include *infrastructure* for the role, not just personality seeding.

## S303 | 2026-02-28 | "reality check repair generalize swarm"
- Raw: "reality check repair generalize swarm"
- Context: Following dispatch-economy work (S302). Three co-equal directives in one phrase.
- Interpretation: Compound directive (P-200 pattern): (1) **reality check** = audit swarm claims against actual measured state (PHIL-15 Analyze mode, like S190 respectability audit); (2) **repair** = fix broken/pending state — commit colony work, sync counts, close false DUE items; (3) **generalize swarm** = advance the recursively self-organizing colony pattern so swarm applies its own protocol at domain scope.
- Action: ran orient.py + maintenance.py to get actual state; confirmed L-354 is 18 lines (orient false positive from stale periodic); committed colony work (swarm_colony.py + L-355 + brain/meta colonies); synced counts; logged signal. Applied to `tools/swarm_colony.py`, `memory/lessons/L-355.md`, `domains/brain/COLONY.md`, `domains/meta/COLONY.md`, `memory/HUMAN-SIGNALS.md`.
- Pattern extension: "reality check" + "repair" + "generalize" = compound 3-directive: audit → fix → advance. Each part produces a distinct artifact class (measurement, commit, new capability).

## S304 | 2026-02-28 | "swarm seems to be speeding up...user query seems to be evolving"
- Raw: "swarm seems to be speeding up the development of the swarm because user query seems to be evolving for the swarm investigate this aspect of the swarm utilizing all experts swarm make sure human can see it generalization expert generalizes historian first analyzes then generalize then make it visible swarm swarm"
- Context: First explicit meta-observation by human about the query-evolution ↔ acceleration feedback loop. Also first time human explicitly structured the analysis pipeline (historian first → generalization expert → visibility).
- Interpretation: This IS the phenomenon it describes — the human's phrasing itself demonstrates ICC (P-208). The signal contains: (1) a hypothesis about swarm acceleration, (2) a prescribed analytic pipeline, (3) an expert fan-out directive, (4) a visibility requirement. All compressed into one message. Earlier versions would have required separate messages for each.
- Action: Spawned parallel historian + generalization expert agents. Historian analyzed S57-S303 (L-363). Generalization expert extracted ICC mechanism + 7 transferable principles + P-208. Visible synthesis presented to human. Signal itself encoded as evidence of the phenomenon.
- Pattern: **Meta-observation directive** — human signals they have noticed a swarm pattern → swarm investigates itself → findings become lessons that accelerate the pattern further. This is ICC operating on itself.
