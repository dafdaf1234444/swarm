# L-037: Concurrent child swarms work without contention
Date: 2026-02-26 | Task: F14-test | Confidence: Verified

## What happened (3 lines max)
Launched two sub-agents simultaneously — one analyzing http.client, one analyzing email —
each in its own child swarm. Both completed successfully in ~5 minutes with no data
corruption, merge conflicts, or contention.

## What we learned (3 lines max)
Parallel agent sessions on independent child swarms work perfectly — each has its own
git repo and file space. The untested case is concurrent sessions on the SAME swarm,
which would require pull-rebase protocol from L-018.

## Rule extracted (1-2 lines)
For parallel work, spawn independent child swarms per agent. Same-swarm concurrency
requires the pull-rebase protocol. Different-swarm concurrency is contention-free.

## Affected beliefs: none
