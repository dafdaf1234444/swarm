# Belief Challenges (append-only — F113)
Never edit past rows. Append new rows to the active table.
Format: `[SNN] | target | challenge | evidence | proposed | STATUS`

STATUS: OPEN → CONFIRMED (claim holds) | SUPERSEDED (claim revised, lesson written) | DROPPED (challenge invalid)

For PHILOSOPHY.md claims (PHIL-N), add rows to beliefs/PHILOSOPHY.md Challenges table instead.
For CORE.md beliefs (B-ID) or PRINCIPLES.md (P-NNN), use this file.

## How to challenge
Any node (parent or child) can append a row. Children: this is how you push findings up.
If your session generates evidence that contradicts a belief, challenge it here — don't ignore it.

## Active challenges

| Session | Target | Challenge | Evidence | Proposed | Status |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|----------|--------|
| S65 | P-140 | protocol:distill = PERMANENT based on 1/3 sessions. Premature. Need 2 more v3 sessions before claiming PERMANENT. | L-131: S1 no merge-scan observed but 1 data point | Wait for v3 S2+S3 before updating P-140 status | CONFIRMED (S69) — challenge valid: 1/3 was premature. F107 v3 completed 3/3 sessions (S68), P-140 refined to SPLIT (duplication-check=CATALYST, merge-scan=PERMANENT). Challenge drove better resolution. |
