| Source | Target | Relationship | Evidence | Session | Date |
|--------|--------|--------------|----------|---------|------|
| B9 nk-complexity (cycles predict bugs) | B13 distributed-systems (EH dominates failures) | NK high-cycle modules correlate with EH bugs in Python (r=-0.3 to -0.5); inverted in Go/Rust due to DAG enforcement (F97) | observed | 46 | 2026-02-27 |
| B10 nk-complexity (cycle count > K_avg as bug predictor) | B13 distributed-systems (EH dominates) | Cycle-count predicts unresolvable bugs; EH bugs are a major subtype of "unresolvable" in distributed systems | theorized | 49 | 2026-02-27 |
