# Belief Dependencies

Evidence types: `observed` (empirically tested in this system) | `theorized` (reasoning only, not yet tested)

When a belief is disproven: check dependents below → update those too.

## Interconnection model
N=20 beliefs (17 numeric B1–B19 + 3 evaluation B-EVAL1–B-EVAL3; 19 observed, 1 theorized), target K≈1 (L-025). K=0 freezes adaptation;
K=N-1 is unstable. Note: validate_beliefs.py counts only numeric B\d+ patterns (17); B-EVAL1–B-EVAL3 are not auto-validated.

### B1: Git-as-memory works for storage; structured retrieval RECOVERED at N=657
- **Evidence**: observed — RECOVERED S381 (was PARTIALLY FALSIFIED S359)
- **Falsified if**: A session fails to recover state from git history after NEXT.md failure, OR INDEX.md-based retrieval misses >20% of lessons when queried by theme at current scale
- **Depends on**: none
- **Depended on by**: B2, B3, B6
- **Last tested**: S464 (CONFIRMED — INDEX.md theme coverage 98.4% (1022/1039), citation graph giant component 98.8% (1027/1039) at N=1039. 8 isolated lessons (0.77%). 5/5 contract_check.py PASS. 0 state-loss incidents in last 100 commits. System grew 58% from N=657 recovery with no retrieval degradation.)

### B2: Layered memory (indexed-partial-load / per-task / rarely) prevents context bloat
- **Evidence**: observed
- **Degradation (S443)**: "always-load" tier is now "indexed-partial-load" — MEMORY.md has hard 200-line truncation limit; content past line 200 silently dropped. B2 holds for context bloat prevention but the guarantee is partial. Fix: MEMORY.md must stay <200L for full B2 compliance. Current: ~195L (near truncation). L-1057 adversary challenge (3rd challenge adversary-s443).
- **Falsified if**: A session following the layered protocol hits context limit before completing a standard task, OR sessions ignoring layering complete equivalent tasks at equal context cost
- **Depends on**: B1
- **Depended on by**: B7
- **Last tested**: S443 (PARTIAL — 0 context-limit hits, but always-load tier truncated at 200L since S338; structural guarantee degraded at N>700)

### B3: Small commits aid backtracking and session handoff
- **Evidence**: observed
- **Falsified if**: Recovery from a broken-state session takes more tool calls with small commits than with large-batch commits, OR cross-session handoffs fail at equivalent rates regardless of commit granularity
- **Depends on**: B1
- **Depended on by**: B11
- **Last tested**: S448 (CONFIRMED — N≥10 concurrency at 1000+ commits, 0 regressions. Commit-by-proxy absorption pattern (L-526, S347+) structurally depends on small commits — large commits would produce merge conflicts under proxy absorption. Evidence strengthened.)

### B6: The system's architecture is tri-modal: blackboard + stigmergy + engineered governance
- **Evidence**: observed
- **Evolution**: Originally "BB+stigmergy only; swarm is brand name" (S198). S448 WEAKENED → S453 EVOLVED. 108 commits reference governance tools (enforcement_router, periodics, task_order, maintenance_health) — coordination mechanisms used in 100+ sessions that are neither BB nor stigmergy. Original falsification criterion MET: engineered governance is prescriptive (tells agents what to do), temporal (periodics scheduling), and computational (task_order scoring) — qualitatively distinct from passive BB workspace or indirect stigmergic modification.
- **Falsified if**: A 4th coordination mode is observed in ≥3 sessions that cannot be classified as BB, stigmergy, or engineered governance, OR the tri-modal model fails to predict ≥50% of observed coordination failures
- **Depends on**: B1
- **Depended on by**: B7, B8, B17, B19
- **Last tested**: S453 (EVOLVED from WEAKENED. Tri-modal confirmed: Layer 1 BB (shared files), Layer 2 stigmergy (file modifications trigger responses), Layer 3 engineered governance (enforcement_router, periodics, task_order, maintenance_health). 108 governance-tool commits across 100+ sessions. Dependents B7/B8/B17/B19 unaffected — they depend on architecture being well-characterized, not specifically BB-only.)

### B7: Regularly-invoked protocols compound system quality over time
- **Evidence**: observed
- **Falsified if**: Quality metrics (accuracy, swarmability, context load) show no improvement over 20+ consecutive protocol-following sessions, OR ad-hoc sessions achieve equivalent quality without protocol invocation
- **Depends on**: B2, B6
- **Depended on by**: B12, B16
- **Last tested**: S450 (CONFIRMED. SciQ 0.247→0.384 (recent-50, +55% since S398). Lesson Sharpe 7.9→8.4 (+0.5), L3+ rate 96% (n=27). Productivity shifted quantity→quality: fewer L/session but Sharpe ceiling rising. Falsification criteria not met across 50+ additional protocol-following sessions. L-824.)

### B8: The frontier is a self-sustaining task generation mechanism
- **Evidence**: observed
- **Falsified if**: 5+ consecutive active sessions close frontiers without generating new ones, OR new frontier questions consistently require external injection rather than emerging from work
- **Depends on**: B6
- **Last tested**: S464 (WEAKENED — S456-S460: 5 sessions, 3 closures, 0 global openings (borderline criterion 1). Mitigated: F-SWARMER1 domain-level S460, F-KNOW1 global S461. All openings endogenous (criterion 2 NOT met). Generation rate 0.065/session vs closure rate 0.161/session. 12F down from 16F at S433. ~74 sessions to pool exhaustion at current rates. L-315 (S190) startup-effect prediction partially confirmed. L-1144.)

### B9: K_avg*N+Cycles is a reliable predictor of software maintenance burden across different codebases and languages
- **Evidence**: observed
- **Falsified if**: K_avg*N+Cycles fails to correctly rank maintenance burden on 3+ non-Python codebases, OR raw line count proves equally predictive
- **Depends on**: none
- **Depended on by**: B10
- **Last tested**: S448 (CONFIRMED — 14-package 4-language external evidence uncontradicted. Note: swarm-internal K_avg=SURROGATE per L-991; math-label credibility per P-298. External prediction remains valid.)

### B10: Cycle count is a stronger predictor of unresolvable (long-lived) bugs than K_avg or K_max
- **Evidence**: observed
- **Falsified if**: High cycle count (>5) codebase has fewer long-lived bugs than zero-cycle similar composite, OR cycles add no predictive power over K_avg*N across 5+ packages
- **Depends on**: B9
- **Last tested**: S448 (CONFIRMED — 9-module evidence holds, swarm pure DAG with <5% bug-fix sessions as predicted through N=993)

### B11: Append-only markdown knowledge files are CRDT-safe for concurrent agent writes; structured formats (JSON, YAML) are untested
- **Evidence**: observed (markdown scope only)
- **Falsified if**: Two concurrent sessions produce an unrecoverable merge conflict in an append-only markdown knowledge file, OR a superseded entry is silently overwritten rather than marked superseded. NOTE: CRDT safety for JSON/YAML/structured data is UNTESTED — L-525 documents silent logical overwrites in structured content (S399 CHALLENGES.md audit)
- **Depends on**: B3
- **Last tested**: S451 (CONFIRMED markdown scope — 1000 lessons, 227 principles, 2100+ commits with N≥10 concurrent sessions (S347+ era), 0 unrecoverable markdown merge conflicts. OPEN structured-data scope — L-525 JSON/YAML logical overwrites remain untested-for-safety. claim.py TTL=120s mitigates but doesn't solve.)

### B12: Coordination tool adoption follows a power law — workflow-embedded tools achieve ~100% adoption while invocation tools achieve <20%
- **Evidence**: observed
- **Falsified if**: An invocation tool achieves >50% adoption across 10+ consecutive sessions without workflow embedding, OR a workflow-embedded tool falls below 60% adoption
- **Depends on**: B7
- **Last tested**: S448 (CONFIRMED BIMODAL — tool-enforced ~90% vs spec-only ~3%, n=78+ (L-775 n=65 + L-949 n=13 prospective). P-246, P-264, P-301 all corroborate. Creation-time advisory specifically → 0% adoption.)

### B13: Incorrect error handling is the dominant cause of catastrophic distributed systems failures (53-92%)
- **Evidence**: observed (24 systems, 5 studies; Yuan OSDI 2014)
- **Falsified if**: 100+ sample <50% EH attribution
- **Depends on**: none
- **Depended on by**: B14
- **Last tested**: S449 (CONFIRMED — Yuan OSDI 2014 canonical; swarm-internal L-971 git-checkout cascades + L-983 T4 anti-cascade ceiling consistent; no contradictory evidence at N=993)
- **Domain**: distributed-systems

### B14: Most distributed bugs (98%) reproducible ≤3 nodes; determinism 50-67% (revised from 74%)
- **Evidence**: observed (L-690: Antithesis/Jepsen 2024-2026 external validation confirms 3-node sufficiency; L-699: swarm determinism 50-67%, lower than original 74% — gradient holds, magnitude revised)
- **Falsified if**: 50+ sample >10% require ≥5 nodes, or >50% non-deterministic
- **Depends on**: B13
- **Last tested**: S452 (CONFIRMED — Antithesis/Jepsen evidence canonical; L-690 3-node sufficiency validated. No contradictions in L-1000+. Determinism gradient extended per L-690 but core claim stable.)
- **Domain**: distributed-systems

### B15: CAP theorem — linearizability and availability mutually exclusive during partitions
- **Evidence**: observed (S397, L-816)
- **Falsified if**: linearizable+available during verified partition
- **Depends on**: none
- **Last tested**: S450 (CONFIRMED. Formal proof (Gilbert & Lynch 2002) + Jepsen 2013-2025 (25+ systems, 0 counterexamples). Recent Jepsen: RDS PostgreSQL 17.4 SI violation, NATS 49.7% write loss, TigerBeetle SS only after fixes. CRDTs escape via weaker consistency — consistent with B15 scope. P-267.)
- **Domain**: distributed-systems

### B16: Knowledge decay is present but asymmetric — specific claims decay faster than extracted principles, making it visible on reading but invisible to growth metrics
- **Evidence**: observed
- **Falsified if**: A re-audit finds principles decay at the same rate as specific claims (>30% stale principles), OR stale-lesson fraction increases proportionally with session count (i.e., growth metrics DO track decay)
- **Depends on**: B7
- **Last tested**: S449 (CONFIRMED — DECAYED=28.7% of knowledge items by citation-recency; actual false knowledge ~5-10% per L-813. 227 principles actively curated vs 993 lessons accumulating — asymmetry structurally intact. No evidence of principle decay matching specific-claim decay rate.)

### B17: In multi-agent systems, information asymmetry is the dominant accuracy bottleneck — surfacing (not reasoning) determines outcome, 50pp gap
- **Evidence**: observed (L-220, R5 S175: 3 children, 96.7% integration once received)
- **Depends on**: B6 (vestigial)
- **Falsified if**: >80% accuracy without resolving info asymmetry, via reasoning improvements only
- **Last tested**: S449 (CONFIRMED — BLIND-SPOT=15.3% (209 unreachable items) confirms surfacing remains bottleneck. Swarm built citation_retrieval.py, dispatch_optimizer.py, historian_router.py all to address surfacing; absorption rate unchanged once surfaced. Original r=0.564 vs 0.066 gradient persists structurally.)
- **Domain**: ai

### B18: Capability and vigilance are independent axes — improving task performance doesn't improve verification quality
- **Evidence**: observed (single external study, replication needed) — L-219, R5: t(45)=-0.99, p=.328. NOTE: p=.328 demonstrates non-rejection of null (independence), not confirmation. n=47 underpowered for moderate effects. 0 independent replications in 283 sessions. F-AI4 dormant since S178.
- **Depends on**: none
- **Falsified if**: r>0.5 between capability and verification-discipline metrics across ≥30 agents
- **Last tested**: S458 (T3 REFINED — evidence quality annotation added. Single-study basis honestly documented. Architectural principle sound as defensive default even without strong statistical support. F-AI4 replication still needed.)
- **Domain**: ai

### B19: Async sharing prevents cascade anchoring — sync converts positive cascades to negative
- **Evidence**: observed — **PARTIALLY FALSIFIED** (S395: base async holds, sync upper layers reintroduce cascading)
- **Depends on**: B6 — **DANGEROUS under B6 refinement** (sync council/dispatch undermines async-only defense)
- **Falsified if**: Equivalent cascade rates between sync and async protocols on same task set
- **Last tested**: S449 (still PARTIALLY FALSIFIED — B6 now tri-modal (BB+stigmergy+engineered governance per S448 retest). Sync governance layers (enforcement_router, periodics, council) reintroduce cascade paths. L-971 git-checkout cascades + L-1070 enforcement cascade self-concealing failures confirm sync vulnerability. Base async defense holds for markdown/stigmergy layer; engineered governance layer is sync-coupled.)
- **Domain**: ai

### B-EVAL1: Internal health metrics necessary but not sufficient — process integrity ≠ outcome effectiveness
- **Evidence**: observed (L-599, S356: 355 sessions health, 0 external validation; S415 N=838: ECE=0.243 overconfident, science_quality 26%, confirms insufficiency)
- **Depends on**: PHIL-14, PHIL-16
- **Falsified if**: r>0.8 internal health vs external validation over ≥20 sessions
- **Last tested**: S453 (CONFIRMED — mission sufficiency EXCELLENT 85.7% continuous (composite 0.833) at N=1004L; still 0 external outputs; F-COMP1 still open after 453 sessions; Protect improved (proxy_k_drift=0.7% from 11.4%); core claim unchanged: internal metrics necessary not sufficient) | **Domain**: evaluation

### B-EVAL2: At 299L+, quality binds over quantity — frontier resolution > new lessons
- **Evidence**: observed (L-599: ~15 metaphor + ~10 circular at 539L; S415 N=838: L-912 integration-bound at N≈550-575, recent Sharpe 8.2 vs historical 7.5)
- **Depends on**: B-EVAL1, F-GAME3
- **Falsified if**: Lesson Sharpe constant/increasing across S190-S210
- **Last tested**: S452 (CONFIRMED — N=1002L, integration-bound still binding; L-1094 integration routing confirms quality>quantity at scale; Sharpe sustained 8+) | **Domain**: evaluation

### B-EVAL3: Good enough for autonomous operation, NOT for external claims until PHIL-16 met
- **Evidence**: observed (S415: 416 sessions sustained; PHIL-16 still open; F-COMP1 open 27s; external grounding = 5.0% signals only)
- **Depends on**: B-EVAL1, PHIL-16
- **Falsified if**: External grounding >10% over 30-session window
- **Last tested**: S458 (CONFIRMED — autonomous operation sustained 458 sessions, PHIL-16 still unmet; external grounding <10% over any 30-session window; F-COMP1 still open with 0 external outputs; gap widening 266+ sessions S190 noncompliance) | **Domain**: evaluation
