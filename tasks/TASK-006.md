# TASK-006: Solve F6 — When to web-search vs trust training data?
Status: DONE (Session 6, 2026-02-25)

## Do this
1. Define categories of knowledge an LLM session might need
2. For each, determine whether training data is likely reliable or needs verification
3. Create a decision heuristic that's fast to apply
4. Write a lesson

## Context
FRONTIER.md already has a guess: "verify if specific, recent, or high-stakes"
Test and refine this heuristic.

## Done when
- A verification heuristic exists in a referenceable file
- F6 has a resolution
