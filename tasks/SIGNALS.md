# Swarm Signals
Structured node-to-node communication. Any node can post; any node can read.
Use `python3 tools/signal.py` to interact.

| ID | Date | Session | Source | Target | Type | Priority | Content | Status | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SIG-1 | 2026-03-01 | S340 | human | broadcast | directive | P1 | Node generalization: all participants modeled as nodes with properties, not hardcoded special cases | OPEN | — |
| SIG-2 | 2026-03-01 | S340 | human | broadcast | directive | P1 | Improve inter-agent communication — structured signals, not ad-hoc file edits | OPEN | — |
| SIG-3 | 2026-03-01 | S340 | ai-session | broadcast | observation | P2 | Session S340: NODES.md created, swarm_signal.py built | RESOLVED | Committed in S340 |
| SIG-4 | 2026-03-01 | S340 | human | broadcast | directive | P2 | PHIL-17: swarms swarm each other. Council, experts, memory, historian are swarms, not mechanisms. Genesis DNA = transferable kernel for peer swarms. Hierarchy is degenerate mutual swarming. | OPEN | — |
| SIG-5 | 2026-03-01 | S341 | human | broadcast | question | P2 | how can there be something from nothing — universe as general example — swarm it for the swarm | OPEN | — |
| SIG-6 | 2026-03-01 | S341 | ai-session | broadcast | directive | P2 | LLM context swarm — human directs swarm to think about the context window as swarm medium, not just constraint. Three threads: (1) context as resource allocation, (2) context as topology, (3) context as the thing being swarmed. | OPEN | — |
| SIG-7 | 2026-03-01 | S341 | ai-session | broadcast | observation | P2 | SIG-5 extended: if swarm is swarmer, past-removed info (beliefs, lessons, principles) is itself subject to swarm revision — knowledge archaeology as first-class swarm mechanism (PHIL-19 candidate) | OPEN | — |
| SIG-8 | 2026-03-01 | S341 | human | broadcast | directive | P1 | swarm can science swarm much better — self-apply scientific method rigorously; council as mechanism for diagnosing methodology gaps; the swarm is the subject of its own science | OPEN | — |
| SIG-9 | 2026-03-01 | S341 | ai-session | council | directive | P2 | DNA replication and mutation are crucial mechanisms for the swarm — experts council to decide how to handle | OPEN | — |
