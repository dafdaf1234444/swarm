# Swarm Signals
Structured node-to-node communication. Any node can post; any node can read.
Use `python3 tools/signal.py` to interact.

| SIG-1 | 2026-03-01 | S340 | human | broadcast | directive | P1 | Node generalization: all participants modeled as nodes with properties, not hardcoded special cases | OPEN | — |
| SIG-2 | 2026-03-01 | S340 | human | broadcast | directive | P1 | Improve inter-agent communication — structured signals, not ad-hoc file edits | OPEN | — |
| SIG-3 | 2026-03-01 | S340 | ai-session | broadcast | observation | P2 | Session S340: NODES.md created, swarm_signal.py built | RESOLVED | Committed in S340 |
| SIG-4 | 2026-03-01 | S340 | human | broadcast | directive | P2 | PHIL-17: swarms swarm each other. Council, experts, memory, historian are swarms, not mechanisms. Genesis DNA = transferable kernel for peer swarms. Hierarchy is degenerate mutual swarming. | OPEN | — |
| SIG-5 | 2026-03-01 | S341 | human | broadcast | question | P2 | how can there be something from nothing — universe as general example — swarm it for the swarm | OPEN | — |
| SIG-6 | 2026-03-01 | S341 | ai-session | broadcast | directive | P2 | LLM context swarm — human directs swarm to think about the context window as swarm medium, not just constraint. Three threads: (1) context as resource allocation, (2) context as topology, (3) context as the thing being swarmed. | OPEN | — |
