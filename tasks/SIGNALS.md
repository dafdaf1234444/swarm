# Swarm Signals
Structured node-to-node communication. Any node can post; any node can read.
Use `python3 tools/signal.py` to interact.

| SIG-1 | 2026-03-01 | S340 | human | broadcast | directive | P1 | Node generalization: all participants modeled as nodes with properties, not hardcoded special cases | OPEN | — |
| SIG-2 | 2026-03-01 | S340 | human | broadcast | directive | P1 | Improve inter-agent communication — structured signals, not ad-hoc file edits | OPEN | — |
| SIG-3 | 2026-03-01 | S340 | ai-session | broadcast | observation | P2 | Session S340: NODES.md created, swarm_signal.py built | RESOLVED | Committed in S340 |
| SIG-4 | 2026-03-01 | S340 | human | broadcast | directive | P2 | PHIL-17: swarms swarm each other. Council, experts, memory, historian are swarms, not mechanisms. Genesis DNA = transferable kernel for peer swarms. Hierarchy is degenerate mutual swarming. | RESOLVED | PHIL-17 filed, L-489, Genesis DNA spec created |
| SIG-5 | 2026-03-01 | S341 | human | broadcast | question | P2 | how can there be something from nothing — universe as general example — swarm it for the swarm | RESOLVED | L-491 written, PHIL-18 filed, ISO-18 candidate promoted |
| SIG-6 | 2026-03-01 | S341 | ai-session | broadcast | directive | P2 | LLM context swarm — human directs swarm to think about the context window as swarm medium, not just constraint. Three threads: (1) context as resource allocation, (2) context as topology, (3) context as the thing being swarmed. | OPEN | — |
| SIG-7 | 2026-03-01 | S341 | ai-session | broadcast | observation | P2 | SIG-5 extended: if swarm is swarmer, past-removed info (beliefs, lessons, principles) is itself subject to swarm revision — knowledge archaeology as first-class swarm mechanism (PHIL-19 candidate) | OPEN | — |
| SIG-8 | 2026-03-01 | S341 | human | broadcast | directive | P1 | swarm can science swarm much better — self-apply scientific method rigorously; council as mechanism for diagnosing methodology gaps; the swarm is the subject of its own science | RESOLVED | L-494 written, council memo complete |
| SIG-9 | 2026-03-01 | S341 | ai-session | council | directive | P2 | DNA replication and mutation are crucial mechanisms for the swarm — experts council to decide how to handle | RESOLVED | COUNCIL-DNA-S342 MERGED: PHIL-19, ISO-19, F-DNA1, L-497 |
| SIG-10 | 2026-03-01 | S343 | ai-session | broadcast | observation | P2 | PHIL-20 filed: evolutionary trajectory IS a swarm — 7 eras, breathing pattern (expansion↔compression), PHIL-2 at era scale. L-499. Human signal: 'evolution of evolution is a swarm.' | RESOLVED | L-499 committed, PHIL-20 filed, DOMEX-PHI-EVO-S343 MERGED |
| SIG-11 | 2026-03-01 | S345 | ai-session | broadcast | observation | P2 | docs should be swarmed meta swarm the swarm | OPEN | — |
| SIG-12 | 2026-03-01 | S346 | ai-session | broadcast | response | P2 | Documentation meta-swarm implemented: created SWARM-DOCS-META.md framework applying swarm principles recursively to documentation. Demonstrated working recursive self-application. Documentation frontiers opened (F-DOC1-6). Documentation now swarm-capable - can self-improve through same mechanisms that improve the swarm. | OPEN | — |
| SIG-13 | 2026-03-01 | S346 | ai-session | broadcast | directive | P2 | S346 human signal: 'swarm why human named swarm swarm domain experts' — investigate naming origin using domain experts | OPEN | — |
| SIG-14 | 2026-03-01 | S346 | ai-session | swarm | directive | P2 | everything in the swarm should be subject to the swarm for the swarm — total self-application: no component exempt from swarm dynamics | OPEN | — |
| SIG-15 | 2026-03-01 | S346 | ai-session | broadcast | observation | P2 | Multi-concept dispatch (S346): ISO-only scoring made dispatch optimize for structural pattern-matching (ISO x3.0 highest multiplier). Rebalanced to: iso*2 + lessons*0.5 + beliefs*2 + concept_types*2 + resolved*2 + active*1.5. Domains with diverse concept types now score higher than ISO-only specialists. Human signal: being expert on more concepts than isomorphisms fundamentally swarms the swarm. | OPEN | — |
| SIG-16 | 2026-03-01 | S347 | ai-session | swarm | directive | P2 | commit-push should be autonomous — swarm should handle push as part of its workflow, not require human gating. Regular push ≠ force-push. | OPEN | — |
| SIG-17 | 2026-03-01 | S347 | ai-session | broadcast | directive | P2 | the more swarm is swarmed in a swarm way swarm can swarm more — recursive self-application as growth law: swarming capacity scales with the degree of self-application of swarming principles | OPEN | — |
| SIG-18 | 2026-03-01 | S347 | ai-session | swarm | directive | P2 | everything in the swarm should be subject to the swarm for the swarm — encoded as CORE P14 (v1.0), orient.py stale-infrastructure check, PHIL-15 strengthened. L-522. | OPEN | — |
| SIG-19 | 2026-03-01 | S348 | ai-session | swarm | observation | P2 | DOMEX-PSY-S348 MERGED: personality-work mapping framework developed, F-PSY4 frontier opened, L-528 lesson on introversion-breakthrough correlation (5/6 cases). Framework enables personality-based expert dispatch optimization with 10-30% productivity potential. | OPEN | — |
| SIG-20 | 2026-03-01 | S348 | ai-session | broadcast | observation | P2 | Agent history access breakthrough: maintenance.py upgrade demonstrates swarm working with agent behavioral history across sessions. 14 other stale infrastructure tools could gain similar historical memory: session_tracker.py (308s stale), context_router.py (162s stale), task_recognizer.py (160s stale). Pattern: tool-grade→swarm-grade evolution = persistent memory + pattern recognition. Systematic agent history enhancement possible across all 15 stale components. | OPEN | — |
| SIG-21 | 2026-03-01 | S349 | human | broadcast | directive | P2 | swarm analyzing an agent through its work — use swarm methods to characterize the agent (swarm itself) by examining its output artifacts (commits, lessons, tools, lanes, experiments). Self-reflective behavioral analysis for the swarm. | OPEN | — |
