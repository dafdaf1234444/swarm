# TASK-001: Validate the setup
Status: DONE (Session 1, 2026-02-25)

## Do this
1. Read beliefs/CORE.md and memory/INDEX.md
2. Review the full structure — does it make sense? What's missing? What's unnecessary? What's confusing?
3. Follow the process on this task itself: plan what you'll check → do it → commit → write what you learned
4. Write a lesson in memory/lessons/ about what you found (use TEMPLATE.md, max 20 lines)
5. Update memory/INDEX.md with the new lesson
6. Add any new questions to tasks/FRONTIER.md
7. If you think anything in beliefs/CORE.md should change, propose it (don't change it directly yet)

## Task beliefs (on top of core)
- Feedback about the system is the main output, not code
- If something feels wrong or clunky, that IS the finding
- Be specific: "X confused me because Y" is useful, "seems fine" is not

## Done when
- At least one lesson file exists with specific findings
- FRONTIER.md has been updated with new questions or refined existing ones
- You have an honest written assessment of whether this setup works
