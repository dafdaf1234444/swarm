# TASK-003: Solve F4 — How do we measure system improvement?
Status: DONE (Session 3, 2026-02-25)

## Do this
1. Define what "improving" means for this system
2. Propose measurable indicators (must be extractable from git + files alone)
3. Create a lightweight health check that any session can run
4. Write a lesson

## Constraints
- Metrics must be cheap to compute (no external tools needed)
- Must work with git as the only infrastructure
- Should detect both growth (good) and bloat (bad)

## Done when
- A HEALTH.md file exists with runnable checks
- F4 has a resolution or refined next step
