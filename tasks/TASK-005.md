# TASK-005: Investigate F3 — Is "swarm" the right model?
Status: DONE (Session 5, 2026-02-25)

## What was done
Researched 6 coordination models against our actual architecture.
Conclusion: system is a blackboard+stigmergy hybrid. "Swarm" is technically inaccurate
but pragmatically fine as a brand name. Updated B6, wrote L-005.

## Decision
Keep the name "swarm" for recognition, but update B6 to reflect the actual model.
