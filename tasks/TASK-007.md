# TASK-007: Solve F5 — Work vs meta-work ratio
Status: DONE (Session 7, 2026-02-25)

## Do this
1. Define "work" vs "meta-work" in this system's context
2. Assess current ratio and whether it's appropriate for this phase
3. Propose a phase-dependent ratio
4. Write a lesson

## Context
Initial guess in FRONTIER.md: 70/30 (work/meta).
Current reality: 0/100 (all meta-work). This is expected in genesis but must shift.

## Done when
- A guideline exists for balancing work vs meta-work
- F5 has a resolution
