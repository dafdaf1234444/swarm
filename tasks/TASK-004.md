# TASK-004: Solve F7 — Belief conflict resolution protocol
Status: DONE (Session 4, 2026-02-25)

## Do this
1. Identify the types of conflicts that can arise between sessions
2. Design a lightweight resolution protocol using only git + file conventions
3. Add the protocol to an appropriate location
4. Write a lesson

## Key insight
Git handles *text* merges. The problem is *semantic* merges — two sessions updating the same belief in contradictory ways, or one session's lesson contradicting another's.

## Done when
- A conflict resolution protocol exists
- F7 has a resolution
