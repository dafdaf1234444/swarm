# Swarm Lanes — Multi-Agent / Multi-PR / Multi-LLM / Multi-Platform
Purpose: coordinate concurrent work streams so independent agents can ship in parallel without merge collisions.

Use this when work is expected to produce multiple branches or pull requests, or when the run spans mixed models/platforms.

## Rules
- Append-only log. Do not rewrite old rows.
- One lane ID per mergeable objective.
- Update lane state by appending a newer row for the same lane ID.
- No parked active lanes: `READY`/`CLAIMED`/`ACTIVE` rows must get next-session progress (`progress`/`blocked`/`next_step`) or be closed/reassigned.
- `Scope-Key` must represent the primary write surface (for example `tools/maintenance.py` or `docs/protocol-core`).
- Use `Etc` for extra axes not covered by fixed columns (`runtime=wsl`, `dataset=...`, `tool=codex`, etc.).
- For active lanes (`CLAIMED`/`ACTIVE`/`BLOCKED`/`READY`), `Etc` must include:
  `setup=<swarm-setup>` (host/tool/runtime profile), `focus=<scope>` (`global` or a concentrated subsystem),
  `available=<yes|no|partial>`, `blocked=<none|reason>`, `next_step=<action>`,
  `human_open_item=<none|HQ-N>`, `expect=<predicted-outcome>` (declare before acting), and
  `artifact=<path>` (commit to what will be produced). Use `python3 tools/open_lane.py` to create lanes
  with these fields enforced automatically (F-META1 enforcement, S331).
- For assignment events (`READY`/`CLAIMED`), include dispatch provenance in `Etc` (`dispatch=<source>`), and add `slot=<n>` and/or `reassigned_from=<lane|slot>` when applicable.
- For active lanes with domain focus (`focus=domains/<domain>` or `Scope-Key` under `domains/<domain>/...`), `Etc` must also include:
  `domain_sync=<queued|syncing|synced|stale|n/a>` and `memory_target=<domain memory path being synchronized>`.
- When multiple setups are active at once, keep at least one lane with `focus=global` so cross-setup coordination stays explicit.

## Status values
- Active: `CLAIMED`, `ACTIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `READY`
- Closed: `MERGED`, `ABANDONED`

Expect Gini <0.45 over S358-S368 window. Coverage restored to >80%.; actual=Visit Gini WORSENED 0.459→0.827 in S358-S368. Coverage 28.6% (12/42 domains). Meta 30% of visits despite saturation penalty. Dispatch compliance 75% top-3 but meta ranks #1 in most sessions — penalty coefficient too low. Score improvement did NOT translate to behavioral improvement.; diff=Expected Gini <0.45 and coverage >80%. Got Gini 0.827 and coverage 28.6%. Prediction WRONG by large margin. Score-behavior gap is the binding constraint, not the scoring formula itself.; artifact=experiments/economy/f-eco5-coverage-remeasure-s368.json; progress=active; available=yes; blocked=none;  human_open_item=none; domain_sync=queued; memory_target=domains/economy/tasks/FRONTIER.md, progress=closed, next_step=none | MERGED | F-ECO5 ADVANCED (NEGATIVE): score-behavior gap — saturation penalty insufficient.

Alterity ratio <20%. Level-1 modeling only.; actual=Alterity ratio 5.5% (3/55 genuine other-modeling). Self-projection 76.4%. Key asymmetry: sessions document concurrent awareness in actual/diff but produce self-projecting predictions. Format IS the mechanism (P-218).; diff=Expected <20% alterity, got 5.5% — even lower. Expected self-projection >80%, got 76.4% (close). Did NOT predict the actual/diff → Next: propagation gap: sessions learn about concurrency but don't encode it in predictions.; artifact=experiments/empathy/f-emp4-alterity-measurement-s368.json; progress=active; available=yes; blocked=none;  human_open_item=none; domain_sync=queued; memory_target=domains/empathy/tasks/FRONTIER.md, progress=closed, next_step=none | MERGED | F-EMP4 CONFIRMED: alterity 5.5% (3/55). Format produces self-projection. L-672. Successor: add context markers to Next: format + re-measure S390. |
