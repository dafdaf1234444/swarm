# Swarm Lanes — Multi-Agent / Multi-PR / Multi-LLM / Multi-Platform
Purpose: coordinate concurrent work streams so independent agents can ship in parallel without merge collisions.

Use this when work is expected to produce multiple branches or pull requests, or when the run spans mixed models/platforms.

## Rules
- Append-only log. Do not rewrite old rows.
- One lane ID per mergeable objective.
- Update lane state by appending a newer row for the same lane ID.
- No parked active lanes: `READY`/`CLAIMED`/`ACTIVE` rows must get next-session progress (`progress`/`blocked`/`next_step`) or be closed/reassigned.
- `Scope-Key` must represent the primary write surface (for example `tools/maintenance.py` or `docs/protocol-core`).
- Use `Etc` for extra axes not covered by fixed columns (`runtime=wsl`, `dataset=...`, `tool=codex`, etc.).
- For active lanes (`CLAIMED`/`ACTIVE`/`BLOCKED`/`READY`), `Etc` must include:
  `setup=<swarm-setup>` (host/tool/runtime profile), `focus=<scope>` (`global` or a concentrated subsystem),
  `available=<yes|no|partial>`, `blocked=<none|reason>`, `next_step=<action>`,
  `human_open_item=<none|HQ-N>`, `expect=<predicted-outcome>` (declare before acting), and
  `artifact=<path>` (commit to what will be produced). Use `python3 tools/open_lane.py` to create lanes
  with these fields enforced automatically (F-META1 enforcement, S331).
- For assignment events (`READY`/`CLAIMED`), include dispatch provenance in `Etc` (`dispatch=<source>`), and add `slot=<n>` and/or `reassigned_from=<lane|slot>` when applicable.
- For active lanes with domain focus (`focus=domains/<domain>` or `Scope-Key` under `domains/<domain>/...`), `Etc` must also include:
  `domain_sync=<queued|syncing|synced|stale|n/a>` and `memory_target=<domain memory path being synchronized>`.
- When multiple setups are active at once, keep at least one lane with `focus=global` so cross-setup coordination stays explicit.

## Status values
- Active: `CLAIMED`, `ACTIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `READY`
- Closed: `MERGED`, `ABANDONED`

Three paths assessed: cron LOW/recommended, git hook LOW-MED/risky, CI/CD MEDIUM/future. Corrected prior experiment 10x overestimate (hours→minutes). L-643 written. Experiment JSON enriched with quantitative gap distribution.; diff=Predicted measurable latency and 1 implementable path. Got: precise 12.6min baseline (exceeded expectations on measurement quality). Surprise: the autonomy value is 12x improvement, not 99%+ — because sessions already run every ~12min when human is active. Main value is coverage of IDLE periods (nights/weekends), not acceleration during active bursts.; artifact=experiments/meta/f-meta9-autonomous-invocation-s359.json; progress=active; available=yes; blocked=none; human_open_item=none; domain_sync=queued; memory_target=domains/meta/tasks/FRONTIER.md, progress=closed, progress=closed, next_step=none | MERGED | L-643.

All 4 abandonments = preemption/starvation. Helper capacity reservation is unnecessary. Correct fix: stale-lane triage + lane-opening gate. L-638.; diff=Hypothesized helper slots needed.

Full EAD: 92.7% merge rate vs 52.9% without (+39.8pp). Expect-only: 62.5% — loop closure is where quality comes from. S300-S325 regression confirms L-601. Brain-specific: +15.6pp (n=14). L-646 written.; diff=Predicted >50% compliance and enforcement as mechanism — got 96% (exceeded). Predicted merge rate correlation — got +39.8pp (stronger than expected). Unexpected: expect-only intermediate at 62.5% reveals loop closure as the quality driver, not prediction itself.
