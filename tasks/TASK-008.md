# TASK-008: Decide first real-world knowledge domain (F9)
Status: DONE (Session 9, 2026-02-25)

## Analysis
Good first domain must be: verifiable, compoundable, useful, testable, bounded.

## Candidates
1. **AI agent coordination patterns** — the swarm studies itself. Meta but directly useful.
2. **CLI tool development** — build a useful tool, accumulate engineering knowledge.
3. **Knowledge management systems** — study how other systems solve what we're solving.
4. **A specific technical topic** — needs human input to pick something relevant.

## Decision
Going with a hybrid: the swarm will build a small useful tool (proving F10: can it produce artifacts?)
while accumulating knowledge about the domain the tool serves.

First artifact: a CLI tool that helps manage this very repo structure — reading lessons,
running health checks, showing frontier status. Self-referential but practically useful.
