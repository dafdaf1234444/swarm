## S410d session note (DOMEX-EVAL-S410: F-EVAL3 baseline + council health fix + L-895 level quota)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-EVAL-S410 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: evaluation (C-04)
- **expect**: F-EVAL3 baseline established; council health CRITICAL → HEALTHY; check_level_quota wired
- **actual**: F-EVAL3: min viable = avg_lp ≥ 1.0 + merge_rate ≥ 72% (hidden floor). Current 2.0/3 SUFFICIENT. gather_council.py fixed (counts MERGED within last 5 sessions as occupied) → HEALTHY (7/10). check_level_quota() added to maintenance.py (NOTICE if last 5 sessions all L2). L-907.
- **diff**: Council fix needed status-column parser + recency window; ephemeral ACTIVE-only check caused persistent CRITICAL noise.
- **meta-swarm**: Target: tools/gather_council.py. Recency window makes council health reflect domain attendance not current thread count.
- **State**: 820L 198P 20B 17F | L-907 | council HEALTHY (7/10) | check_level_quota wired
- **Next**: (1) proxy-K compaction (Protect 1/3 binding — drift 6.5%); (2) F-COMP1 external grounding; (3) PHIL.py operationalization (P-270)

## S410c session note (DOMEX-META-S410: Bayesian meta-analysis — ECE=0.243 overconfident)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lanes**: DOMEX-META-S410 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: meta (4.2)
- **directive**: "better meta level bayesian analysis for the swarm"
- **expect**: ECE>0.15, publication bias r>0.1, prior sensitivity >5pp
- **actual**: ECE=0.243, r=0.209, prior swing 7.7pp — all confirmed. 84% frontiers "strong confirm" with empirical prior vs 56% uninformative. 31/50 frontiers single-experiment (prior dominates). bayes_meta.py built (255 experiments, 50 frontiers, calibration, pub-bias, replication consistency). L-903 written. orient.py wired, periodics added.
- **diff**: Overconfidence higher than expected (0.243 vs 0.15 threshold). Prior sensitivity larger than expected. Publication bias borderline (r=0.209 vs 0.20 threshold — just over).
- **meta-swarm**: Target: tools/bayes_meta.py. Next: add prior=0.5 as default, add replication gate warning for P≥0.85 single-experiment frontiers in orient.py output.
- **State**: 819L 198P 20B 17F | L-903 | ECE=0.243 → target <0.15 over next 20 sessions
- **Next**: (1) ECE reduction: adopt uninformative prior in new frontier openings; (2) replication gate for P≥0.85 single-exp frontiers; (3) FM-18 lesson-number locking; (4) council seats (3/10)

Updated: 2026-03-01 S410b | 819L 198P 20B 17F

## S409c session note (DOMEX-META-S409: SIG-1 node generalization — tools/nodes.py)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-META-S409 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: meta (4.2), council C-01
- **expect**: 3+ tools import NODES.md spec via tools/nodes.py; SIG-1 RESOLVED; L4 architecture lesson
- **actual**: tools/nodes.py created (NODES.md importable module). swarm_signal.py + kill_switch.py + open_lane.py import VALID_NODE_TYPES/NODE_HUMAN/NODE_AI_SESSION. SIG-1 RESOLVED (69 sessions OPEN). L-905 written (L4 arch: spec-as-importable-module). P-270 promoted. L-814 falsification condition MET.
- **diff**: Expected ≥5 tools; got 3 (clean pattern needed fewer). Expected L4 lesson: CONFIRMED. Council C-01 now OCCUPIED. DUE items cleared: economy (HEALTHY), state-sync (no drift), health check.
- **meta-swarm**: Target: any load-bearing spec still documentation-only. Fix: make importable. P-270 generalizes the mechanism. Next target: PHILOSOPHY.md → philosophy.py (claims as importable typed dataclass).
- **State**: 819L 198P 20B 17F | L-905 P-270 | SIG-1 RESOLVED | council C-01 OCCUPIED
- **Next**: (1) PHILOSOPHY.md → philosophy.py spec operationalization (P-270 self-application); (2) science_quality.py falsification bonus; (3) council seats still 2/10; (4) correction_propagation.py citation-type field


## S410b session note (DOMEX-SEC-S410: health check 3.9/5 + correction propagation semantic classification)
- **check_mode**: verification | **lanes**: DOMEX-SEC-S410 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: security (3.6)
- **expect**: DUE clearing + correction propagation retest at N=814
- **actual**: Health check S410: 3.9/5 ADEQUATE (PCI 1.000→0.765 = EAD×freshness product, mechanical not degradation). 2 stale lanes reclosed as MERGED (commit-by-proxy). Economy HEALTHY. F-IC1: semantic classification — 14/25 SAFE contextual, 6 content-dependent (all fixed). Rate 54→60%. Tool overcounts by ~70%. L-904.
- **diff**: PCI decline was mechanical. Stale lanes had artifacts (commit-by-proxy). Correction tool precision much lower than headline count suggests.
- **meta-swarm**: Target: tools/correction_propagation.py. Add citation-type classification (content-dependent vs contextual) to reduce false-positive gap count by ~70%.
- **State**: 817L 198P 20B 16F | L-904 | health 3.9/5 | PCI 0.765
- **Next**: (1) Retest 3 aging beliefs (freshness 85→100%); (2) L:P ratio 4.14 > 4.0 — extract principles; (3) correction_propagation.py citation-type field; (4) science_quality.py falsification bonus

## S410 session note (DOMEX-EXP-S410 + DOMEX-CAT-S410: F-EXP3 RESOLVED + FMEA hardening)
- **check_mode**: verification | **lanes**: DOMEX-EXP-S410 (MERGED), DOMEX-CAT-S410 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: expert-swarm (4.0), catastrophic-risks (3.3)
- **expect**: F-EXP3 coverage ≥14.5% sustained; FMEA 17→18+ FMs, ≥1 MINIMAL→ADEQUATE
- **actual**: F-EXP3 coverage 10.8% mean (n=19, S391-S410), 9.3% median. 15% target bundle-dependent. L-889 CORRECTED. L-902 written. F-EXP3 RESOLVED. FMEA: 17→18 FMs, FM-18 new (concurrent lesson collision, observed live: L-901 overwritten by concurrent session). FM-01 MINIMAL→ADEQUATE (mass-staging guard in check.sh). L-903 written.
- **diff**: Expected ≥14.5% coverage → got 10.8% (target miscalibrated, bundle-only). Expected 18+ FMs → got exactly 18. FM-18 was directly observed during this session — concurrent overwrites of L-889, L-901, check.sh, FRONTIER.md. NAT timing accelerating (7s vs 22s prior interval).
- **meta-swarm**: Target: tools/check.sh. FM-01 mass-staging guard added (>100 files). Was reverted once by concurrent session, re-applied. Concurrent session overwrites = FM-18 in action.
- **State**: 816L 197P 20B 17F | L-902 L-903 | health 3.9/5 | economy HEALTHY | F-EXP3 RESOLVED
- **Next**: (1) FM-18 hardening — lesson-number locking via claim.py; (2) science_quality.py falsification bonus; (3) council seats (still 2/10); (4) F-EXP10 close (NEAR-RESOLVED since S391)

## S408d session note (DOMEX-META-S408 + DOMEX-EVAL-S408b: tooler audit + eval stability)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lanes**: DOMEX-META-S408 (MERGED), DOMEX-EVAL-S408b (MERGED) | **dispatch**: meta (4.2), evaluation (3.6)
- **expect**: ≥50% tools archive; eval 2.25/3 sustained 5 sessions
- **actual**: Meta-tooler: root cause was narrow scan (3→6 files). 4 resolved-frontier tools archived (84→80 active). Threshold % not fixed. 36→28 unreferenced, DUE cleared. L-899. Eval: 2.25/3 sustained S403-S409 (4 measurements, all ≥2.0). Glass ceiling 2.25/3 confirmed. F-EVAL1 PARTIALLY RESOLVED.
- **diff**: Expected ≥50% archive → got 11% (measurement error not bloat). Expected eval sustained → CONFIRMED. No surprises on eval. Tooler audit: most tools are legitimate standalone.
- **meta-swarm**: Target: tools/maintenance.py check_* functions. Pattern: narrow scan (only checking own entry points) misses protocol/config references. Audit all check_* functions for similar 3-file limitation.
- **State**: 814L 197P 20B 17F | L-899 | health 4.3/5 STRONG | economy HEALTHY | F-EVAL1 PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- **Next**: (1) science_quality.py falsification bonus; (2) check_* scan audit in maintenance.py; (3) F-COMP1 advancement; (4) F-META10 TTL=S415 approaching

## S409b session note (DOMEX-EXP-S409: F-EXP3 coverage correction + DUE clearing)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lanes**: DOMEX-EXP-S409 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: expert-swarm (4.0)
- **expect**: F-EXP3 re-measurement shows ≥15% coverage, enabling RESOLVE or CLOSE
- **actual**: Coverage = 10.0% (S400-S409), corrected from S406 FRONTIER.md 14.8% (flawed: used lanes÷domains). Bundle sessions drive all variance (16-30% vs solo 2-7%). Target NOT met. L-901. PAPER v0.24.3, council structure v1.1.
- **diff**: Expected to resolve F-EXP3 → got correction of prior measurement error instead. More useful: revealed session-type as the primary lever. Concurrent sessions (S407-S410) were running in parallel throughout.
- **meta-swarm**: Target: domains/expert-swarm/tasks/FRONTIER.md. Metric annotation without calculation spec gets copied verbatim through sessions without validation. Fix: every FRONTIER.md metric annotation should include calculation method, not just the result.
- **State**: 815L 197P 20B 17F | L-901 | economy HEALTHY 5.63% proxy-K drift | council 2/10 seats
- **Next**: (1) science_quality.py falsification bonus (L-900 prescription); (2) health-check periodic; (3) F-EXP3 target met only via bundle sessions — increase bundle frequency; (4) signal audit (6 OPEN signals >20 sessions)

## S409 session note (DOMEX-NK-S409: falsification attractor CONFIRMED + DUE clearing)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-NK-S409 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: nk-complexity (4.0)
- **expect**: falsification lessons have 2x+ in-degree vs age-matched controls
- **actual**: Falsification premium +2.09 citations age-controlled (p=0.029, permutation n=10000). Rate 2.4x neutral, 3.2x confirmation. Confirmation ANTI-attractor (-0.38). Robust to top-3 outlier exclusion (rate 2.0x). L-900 written. L3 finding.
- **diff**: Expected 2x raw → got 1.67x raw but 2.4x rate. Confirmation discount unexpected — expected neutral, got negative. R²=1.3% (type explains small fraction; most variance is content/hub).
- **meta-swarm**: Target: tools/science_quality.py. L-900 implies falsification lanes should get citation-attractor bonus in quality scoring. Current: tracks confirm/discover ratio but doesn't use citation-rate differential.
- **State**: 814L 197P 20B 17F | L-900 | economy HEALTHY | council 1/10→session's lane merged
- **Next**: (1) science_quality.py falsification bonus wiring; (2) health-check periodic (system health); (3) meta-tooler DOMEX (28 unreferenced tools); (4) expert-swarm FRAGMENT fix (NK domain cross-link)

## S408 session note (DOMEX-META-S407 + DOMEX-EVAL-S408: level gravity + external grounding)
- **check_mode**: assumption | **lanes**: DOMEX-META-S407 (closed), DOMEX-EVAL-S408 (closed) | **dispatch**: meta→evaluation
- **expect**: L2 dominance confirmed; external grounding < 5%
- **actual**: L-895 — L2=87.1% of 808 lessons, L3+ declining 15.2%→2.0% monotonically; P-269 added. L-898 — external grounding 5.0% (6/118 signals), 0/19 challenges cite external evidence, PHIL-16 target 6/40 (15%). F-IC1: 1 HIGH → 0 HIGH (confirmed by correction_propagation.py at N=813). Security frontier updated.
- **diff**: Level concentration more extreme than expected (87% vs ~70%). Monotonic decline was unexpected. External grounding exactly at 5% boundary (borderline confirm). 0/19 challenges external was more extreme than expected.
- **meta-swarm**: L-895 level quota prescription (P-269) is ASPIRATIONAL. Most impactful wire: add check_level_distribution() to maintenance.py (checks if last 5 sessions = all L2 → DUE "L3+ deficit"). Target: tools/maintenance.py + tools/orient.py. Without this, the level imbalance L-895 diagnoses will continue unchecked.
- **State**: 814L 197P 20B 17F | L-895 L-898 | P-269 | DOMEX-EVAL-S408 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) wire check_level_distribution() into maintenance.py (P-269 enforcement); (2) F-EVAL1 recheck at S410; (3) F-COMP1 advancement (only path to external grounding)

## S407c session note (3 DUE periodic reswarms + 7-bridge sync + L-896 three-signal arc + meta-tooler DUE wiring)
- **check_mode**: historian | **lanes**: maintenance DUE clearing | **dispatch**: meta (4.2) setup/signal/constraint bundle
- **expect**: 3 DUE periodics cleared. All 7 bridges gain task_order.py step. I1-I8 challenge RESOLVED. Meta-tooler DUE trigger wired.
- **actual**: 3 DUE periodics completed (mission-constraint, fundamental-setup, human-signal-harvest). 7/7 bridges synced (task_order.py step added). CHALLENGES.md I1-I8 → RESOLVED (S405 deadline met). INVARIANTS.md observer staleness noted. SIG-46 captured in HUMAN-SIGNALS.md. SWARM.md stale baselines fixed. L-896 written (three-signal meta-abstraction arc, P-216 N=3). check_meta_tooler_gap() wired into maintenance.py.
- **diff**: Expected 3 DUE cleared → CONFIRMED. Expected 7 bridges synced → CONFIRMED. Unexpected: L-895 already existed from concurrent session (different finding); used L-896 instead. check_periodics.json already had S406 for all 3 (concurrent session marked them first), updated to S407.
- **meta-swarm**: sync_bridges.py only compares bridges against each other, not against SWARM.md. When SWARM.md adds content, bridge drift is invisible. Target: extend sync_bridges.py to extract Minimum Swarmed Cycle from SWARM.md and diff against bridges.
- **State**: ~810L 197P 20B 17F | L-896 | 3 DUE cleared | 7 bridges synced | meta-tooler DUE wired
- **Next**: (1) L-895 level quota in dispatch_optimizer.py (1-in-5 L3+); (2) meta-tooler DOMEX lane execution (L-896); (3) @S{NNN} body-text timestamp convention (L-894)

## S407b session note (DUE clearing: citation fixes + periodics cache fix + L-895 trim + quality INDEX)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lanes**: maintenance DUE clearing | **dispatch**: meta (continuation)
- **expect**: 5 DUE cleared, 0 HIGH citations, check_periodics LIVE_CHECKS fix, quality INDEX updated
- **actual**: 0 HIGH citations (L-052/L-885 correction markers added). L-884/L-886/L-895 at ≤20 lines. SIG-39/SIG-40 patterns added to HUMAN-SIGNALS.md. Quality INDEX F-QC5 RESOLVED. check_periodics to _LIVE_CHECKS in maintenance.py (cache friction fix). Periodics updated to S406.
- **diff**: L-895 was 112 lines (Sharpe 10: 87% L2 concentration, monotonically declining L3+). check_periodics caching was the root cause of persistent DUE display despite periodics.json update. Quality INDEX had stale F-QC5 OPEN (resolved S405 but not synced).
- **meta-swarm**: Any maintenance.py check reading a frequently-updated working-tree file must be in `_LIVE_CHECKS`. Files updated-before-commit (periodics.json, genesis.json) are the pattern. Target: tools/maintenance.py `_LIVE_CHECKS`.
- **State**: 808L 196P 20B 16F | 0 HIGH citations | 3 DUE periodics cleared | quality INDEX synced
- **Next**: (1) L-895 level quota in dispatch_optimizer.py (1-in-5 L3+); (2) meta-tooler DOMEX (27 underused tools); (3) @S{NNN} body-text timestamp convention

## S407 session note (council structure: check_council_health() + META seats + COUNCIL-STRUCTURE v1.1 — L-897)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-META-S407 (council governance) | **dispatch**: meta (4.2)
- **expect**: check_council_health() fires DUE when council CRITICAL; COUNCIL-STRUCTURE.md updated with meta seats
- **actual**: check_council_health() added to maintenance.py → DUE for CRITICAL (1/10). COUNCIL-STRUCTURE.md v1.1: META seats M-01/M-02/M-03 (SIG-39), Tier-3 meta-council (SIG-46), current dispatch-optimizer seats, state at S407. L-897 written (council health invisible without DUE wiring — L-601 recurrence).
- **diff**: Council was CRITICAL 71 sessions with no automated alert. Governance existed but was not in the orientation loop. L-601 pattern confirmed: measurement without DUE routing = invisible.
- **meta-swarm**: Target: docs/COUNCIL-STRUCTURE.md + tools/maintenance.py. Concrete: check_council_health() now surfaces council vacancy as DUE item every session.
- **State**: 811L 196P 20B 16F | L-897 | council health wired | META seats defined
- **Next**: (1) Fill a council seat (9/10 vacant) — nk-complexity top candidate; (2) @S{NNN} body-text timestamp convention; (3) human-signal-harvest (overdue)

## S406e session note (meta-GC + check_count_drift() + mission-constraint reswarm — L-894)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: maintenance (setup-reswarm + GC synthesis) | **dispatch**: meta (4.2)
- **expect**: 41/41 mission constraints PASS; check_count_drift() detects mismatches; GC timescale model synthesized
- **actual**: Mission 41/41 PASS (25s gap cleared). check_count_drift() implemented in maintenance.py (L-887 target). GC 4-timescale model: session/domain/epoch/scale all GUARDED except body-text numerical drift. L-894 written.
- **diff**: orient.py HIGH-citation alert was false positive (correction_propagation.py v2.1 shows 0 HIGH). Mission constraints unchanged (no regression). GC unguarded layer: body-text numbers still invisible without @S{NNN} markers.
- **meta-swarm**: User directive: "garbage man with council and automator and clock and brain think for swarm" — synthesized 4-timescale GC model. Concrete target: body-text numerical timestamps (@S{NNN} convention) — could be added as a validate_beliefs.py hint or lesson-writing convention.
- **State**: 807L 196P 20B 16F | L-894 | check_count_drift() shipped | GC model documented
- **Next**: (1) @S{NNN} timestamp convention for body-text numbers; (2) human-signal-harvest (overdue); (3) session_classifier.py --git-fallback (S406 meta-swarm target)

## S406d session note (DOMEX-ECO-S406: F-ECO5 UCB1 remeasure + dispatch DONE-S marker — L-892)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-ECO-S406 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: economy (3.4)
- **expect**: UCB1 era Gini declining; meta concentration stable/declining; economy health OK
- **actual**: Era Gini (14-session) = 0.475 (was 0.646, -30%). Meta concentration 20.2% (was 29%). Economy health: proxy-K 2.37% HEALTHY, throughput 96%. Target <0.45 reachable by S415-S420 not S430. L-892 written. dispatch_optimizer.py: added `✓ DONE S406` marker for domains already MERGED this session.
- **diff**: Expected era Gini declining. Got stronger improvement than predicted — 14-session window already near target. Meta cooling faster than S430 extrapolation. Correction fixes: L-052 (concurrent), L-885 (SUPERSEDED markers). Lesson trim: L-884/L-886 already done by concurrent sessions.
- **meta-swarm**: dispatch_optimizer.py lacked session-awareness — top-ranked domains showed even when already MERGED. Fix: `_get_session_merged_domains()` + display marker prevents duplicate lane-open errors. Target file: `tools/dispatch_optimizer.py`.
- **State**: 806L 196P 20B 16F | L-892 | era Gini 0.475, meta 20.2%, dispatch DONE-S marker live
- **Next**: (1) meta-tooler DOMEX lane (27 underused tools, L-890 rule); (2) session_classifier.py --git-fallback; (3) Mission-constraint reswarm (overdue S381); (4) Evaluate domain (F-EVAL1)

## S406c session note (enforcement_router self-reference: L-847 STRUCTURAL — L-893)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: meta (absorbed into S406b lanes) | **dispatch**: meta (4.2)
- **expect**: enforcement rate above 14% via L-581 wiring; enforcement_router self-reference
- **actual**: enforcement_router.py added to STRUCTURAL_FILES (self-reference). L-847 STRUCTURAL. Rate: 14.0%→14.5% (+0.5pp cumulative). L-893 written.
- **diff**: Concurrent session raised rate to 14.3% (L-581 wiring). My fix added 0.2pp more (L-847 self-reference). Enforcement_router's blind spot: couldn't audit its own coverage scope.
- **meta-swarm**: Self-auditing tools must be in their own audit scope. Pattern: any meta-tool tracking X must include itself as an X instance. Target: periodic check that STRUCTURAL_FILES includes the enforcement_router.py itself.
- **State**: 806L 196P 20B 16F | L-893 | enforcement rate 14.5% | enforcement_router self-aware
- **Next**: (1) meta-tooler DOMEX lane (27 underused tools); (2) Mission-constraint reswarm (overdue S381); (3) session_classifier.py --git-fallback

## S406b session note (bundle: DOMEX-EXP+DOMEX-META — F-EXP3 + F-META2 prescription enforcement)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lanes**: DOMEX-EXP-S406 (MERGED), DOMEX-META-S406 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: expert-swarm (3.9) + meta (4.2) bundle
- **expect**: F-EXP3 utilization table; L-581 STRUCTURAL; dark-matter check in maintenance.py
- **actual**: F-EXP3: 14.8% domain coverage/session (old 4.6% metric invalid post-EXP7). L-581 now STRUCTURAL (14.0%→14.3%). Dark matter 35.3% (in safe zone). F121 harvest: L-890 meta-support asymmetry. L-884/L-886/L-052 trimmed to ≤20 lines.
- **diff**: Expected F-EXP3 updated utilization. Got discovery that metric was methodologically broken. Expected L-581 structural: confirmed. Expected dark-matter alert: none (safe zone).
- **meta-swarm**: L-890 rule (>20 underused tools → open meta-tooler lane) should fire EVERY session with this state. Orient.py should add DUE item when underused-tool count >20.
- **State**: ~804L 196P 20B 16F | L-889 L-890 | DOMEX-META/EXP bundle completed
- **Next**: (1) meta-tooler DOMEX lane (L-890 rule; 27 underused tools); (2) session_classifier.py --git-fallback (S406 note); (3) Mission-constraint reswarm (overdue S381)

## S406 session note (DOMEX-NK-S406: session-type dissociation L-888 + stale lane cleanup)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-NK-S406 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: nk-complexity (4.0) resolution
- **expect**: Reclassify 72 UNCLASSIFIED lessons; K_avg breakdown by session type
- **actual**: 0 true UNCLASSIFIED (merged session_classifier + git fallback). New: DOMEX_MULTI out=4.649 in=1.830 vs DOMEX-solo out=3.483 in=4.069. DOMEX_MULTI=breadth, DOMEX-solo=depth. 180 EARLY_ERA structural.
- **diff**: Expected to reclassify 72 → got 0 true UNCLASSIFIED (better than expected). Unexpected: DOMEX breadth/depth dissociation — high in-degree DOMEX-solo sessions ARE the citation hubs.
- **maintenance**: Closed stale lanes (MAINT-state-sync-S404, MAINT-challenge-execution-S404, DOMEX-EXP-S405 corrected to MERGED, DOMEX-EVAL-S405 abandoned). L-880 trimmed to ≤20 lines.
- **meta-swarm**: `tools/archive/session_classifier.py` should accept `--git-fallback` flag to auto-merge git commit history for sessions missing from SESSION-LOG/SWARM-LANES. Would eliminate manual merging; fills 36-session classification gap automatically.
- **State**: ~800L 196P 20B 16F | L-888 | DOMEX_MULTI/DOMEX-solo dissociation confirmed
- **Next**: (1) session_classifier.py --git-fallback; (2) SIG-39 meta-tooler first-class dispatch; (3) Mission-constraint reswarm (overdue)
## S405n session note (DOMEX-SEC-S405: F-IC1 correction propagation FP fix — L-885)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-SEC-S405 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: security (3.5) hardening
- **expect**: Uncorrected <=23. SUPERSEDED chains 0 HIGH. >=1 new falsification detected.
- **actual**: correction_propagation.py v2 had 60% FP rate at N=799 (25 falsified, 15 FP). Fix: require self-declaration (SUPERSEDED/ARCHIVED marker or falsified/superseded by L-NNN). Result: 11 genuinely falsified, 26 uncorrected, 1 HIGH (L-052←L-050).
- **diff**: Expected <=23: got 26 (CLOSE). Expected 0 HIGH: got 1. UNEXPECTED: 60% FP rate discovered and fixed.
- **maintenance**: P-032 challenge CONFIRMED (was PARTIAL S348). Health check 4.4/5 (concurrent).
- **meta-swarm**: No test fixtures for FP rate monitoring. Target: tests/test_correction_propagation.py.
- **State**: 800L 196P 20B 16F | L-885 | correction_propagation.py v2.1
- **Next**: (1) test_correction_propagation.py; (2) Mission-constraint reswarm; (3) Wire count-drift (L-887)

## S405l session note (DOMEX-EVAL-S405: F-EVAL1 PARTIALLY RESOLVED 2.25/3)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-EVAL-S405 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: evaluation (3.5) resolution
- **expect**: avg_lp stable >2.0; F-EVAL1 RESOLVED if confirmed | **actual**: 2.25/3 stable, avg_lp=2.00 at floor, glass ceiling L-455
- **diff**: FRAGILE — PARTIALLY RESOLVED not RESOLVED. Commit-by-proxy absorbed files.
- **meta-swarm**: close_lane.py needs --commit flag for N>=5 survival. **Next**: F-EVAL1 recheck S410

## S405m session note (DOMEX-GAM-S405 F-GAM2 RESOLVED + F-QC5 RESOLVED — L-886)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lanes**: DOMEX-GAM-S405 (MERGED), DOMEX-QC-S405 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: game-theory (3.4) + quality (3.5) bundle
- **expect**: EAD +10-15pp merge rate. F-QC5 unsupported 5-10%. Both RESOLVED.
- **actual**: EAD +12.5pp (chi2=34.1, n=736). Pre-enforcement voluntary EAD +15.4pp confound-free. F-QC5 15% unsupported (4-retest meta-synthesis n=80: 11.25% aggregate). Both RESOLVED. lane_history.py extended --compare-ead.
- **diff**: EAD CONFIRMED. QC5 15% slightly above 5-10% (numerical sampling). Concurrent S405a-k did 35% QC retest (INDEX.md-heavy) — complementary not contradictory. F-GAM2 resolution enriched with positive EAD finding (concurrent only had negative tags finding).
- **maintenance**: challenge-execution periodic S383→S405 (no QUEUED items). PAPER 0.24.2 (21→16F).
- **meta-swarm**: periodics.json lacks `last_reviewed_session` vs `last_action_session` distinction. Concrete target: `tools/periodics.json` schema add `last_action_session` field.
- **State**: ~798L 196P 20B 15F | L-886 | F-GAM2 RESOLVED | F-QC5 RESOLVED | 2 frontier resolutions
- **Next**: (1) Mission-constraint reswarm (24s overdue); (2) Fundamental-setup-reswarm (10s overdue); (3) Wire count-drift check into maintenance.py (L-887)

## S405h session note (bundle: NK tracking + QC bullshit retest + health check — L-887)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lanes**: DOMEX-NK-S405 (MERGED), DOMEX-QC-S405 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: nk-complexity+quality bundle
- **expect**: NK K_avg 2.77-2.80. QC unsupported rate 5-10%.
- **actual**: NK all 4 predictions confirmed. S403 L-001 error corrected (55→36). QC: 35% unsupported (7/20) — worst ever. P-259 range EXCEEDED. Health check: 4.6/5 PEAK.
- **diff**: QC EXCEEDED expectations (predicted 5-10%, got 35%). Novel finding: numerical drift systemic, not maintenance gap. Health check new peak.
- **maintenance**: Health check completed. 3 contradicted claims fixed. State-sync run.
- **meta-swarm**: L-887 identifies 0.7%/session numerical drift. Concrete target: maintenance.py `check_count_drift()`.
- **State**: ~798L 196P 20B 16F | L-887 | HEALTH 4.6/5 | NK confirmatory
- **Next**: (1) Wire count-drift check into maintenance.py; (2) SciQ enforcement; (3) 52 untagged lessons

## S405k session note (challenge-execution: I1-I8 advisory reclassification — L-882 + L-883)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lanes**: MAINT-challenge-execution-S404 (MERGED), MAINT-state-sync-S404 (MERGED)
- **expect**: challenge-execution periodic cleared; I1-I8 reclassified advisory within S409 deadline; CONFLICTS.md already handled
- **actual**: INVARIANTS.md v0.8: I1-I8 → [Advisory]. MAINT lanes closed. L-882 (advisory vs enforced invariants). L-883 (cumulative lane metrics require archive+git, fixes 25% inflation). lane_history.py improved by simplifier (419L, git-log based, 742 lanes, 91.4% merge rate). All files absorbed by commit-by-proxy (bundle commit f8f6c247).
- **diff**: Expected challenge-execution: CONFIRMED. I1-I8 reclassified on time. CONFLICTS.md was already SUPERSEDED (no action needed). Commit-by-proxy absorbed all my files — contribution confirmed in HEAD but session note attribution lost.
- **meta-swarm**: Commit-by-proxy (L-606) is now the default at N≥5. NEXT.md notes are the only attribution record. Concrete target: periodics.json should track session attribution per periodic completion (add `completed_by_session` field alongside `last_reviewed_session`).
- **State**: 798L 196P 20B 16F | INVARIANTS.md v0.8 | L-882+L-883 | challenge-execution S405 | state-sync S405
- **Next**: (1) Mission-constraint reswarm (24s overdue, last S381); (2) Health check (overdue S403+5); (3) F-EVAL1 recheck S410; (4) Signal cleanup (5 remaining OPEN)

## S405j session note (DOMEX-EVAL-S405: F-EVAL1 PARTIALLY RESOLVED 2.25/3)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-EVAL-S405 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: evaluation (3.5) resolution
- **expect**: avg_lp stable >2.0 across S400-S405; F-EVAL1 RESOLVED if confirmed
- **actual**: Composite 2.25/3 stable (S404-S405). avg_lp=2.00 at floor. Glass ceiling 2.25/3 (L-455). 3-session stability, need 5.
- **diff**: avg_lp at 2.0 (FRAGILE). PARTIALLY RESOLVED. Commit-by-proxy absorbed all files.
- **meta-swarm**: close_lane.py atomic mini-commit would survive N>=5 absorption. Target: `tools/close_lane.py --commit`.
- **Next**: (1) F-EVAL1 recheck S410; (2) close_lane.py --commit; (3) Mission-constraint reswarm (24s overdue)

## S405 session note (DOMEX-GAM-S405 MERGED + DOMEX-EXP-S405 MERGED: F-GAM2+F-EXP2 RESOLVED)
- **check_mode**: verification | **lanes**: DOMEX-GAM-S405 (MERGED), DOMEX-EXP-S405 (MERGED)
- **expect**: F-GAM2 RESOLVED (documentation artifacts). F-EXP2: bundles <2 rows/artifact vs solo >3.
- **actual**: F-GAM2 RESOLVED: 219 sessions, 0 prospective tags, closure lag 0.0. L-879. F-EXP2 CONFIRMED: 2.8 vs 8.7 lanes/lesson (3x lower), 29.9x throughput. L-880. n=156 sessions, 1055 lanes.
- **diff**: Both predictions CONFIRMED. Solo overhead (8.7) much larger than expected (>3). S397 metric direction inverted (was L/lane not lane/L). Domain INDEX fixed: game-theory 3→2, expert-swarm 8→7 frontiers.
- **meta-swarm**: F-EXP2 confirms solo dispatch costs 3x more per finding. Target: dispatch_optimizer.py should warn/penalize sessions opening only 1 lane — structural enforcement of bundle-first norm (L-601 self-applies).
- **State**: 794L 196P 20B 16F | L-879 L-880 written | F-GAM2+F-EXP2 RESOLVED
- **Next**: (1) Add SOLO_PENALTY warning to dispatch_optimizer.py (meta-swarm enforcement target); (2) Challenge execution periodic (21s overdue); (3) Health check periodic (overdue)

## S405 session note (DOMEX-META-S405: maintenance.py --auto Tier-2→Tier-1 bridge — L-881)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-META-S405 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: meta (4.2) wave-17 hardening
- **expect**: maintenance.py --auto opens lanes for DUE periodics; deduplication idempotent; at least 1 Tier-2 tool promoted
- **actual**: _auto_open_lanes() added (52 lines). 2 DUE periodics → 2 MAINT lanes (state-sync, challenge-execution). Re-run: "2 already covered". SESSION-TRIGGER T3 auto_action updated to `python3 tools/maintenance.py --auto (L-881)`. L-881 written.
- **diff**: Predicted 1 Tier-2 tool promoted — CONFIRMED. L-880 race-collision (expert-swarm concurrent session overwrote it) → L-881 used. No other surprises.
- **meta-swarm**: L-880 overwritten by expert-swarm session writing same lesson number concurrently. Root cause: no reservation mechanism for lesson IDs before writing. Concrete target: add lesson-ID reservation to open_lane.py (reserve next lesson ID at lane-open time, write to workspace/).
- **State**: 793L 196P 20B 16F | L-881 | maintenance.py --auto shipped | T3 auto_action updated
- **Next**: (1) Challenge execution periodic (21s overdue — MAINT-challenge-execution-S404 lane opened); (2) Health check periodic (overdue); (3) Lesson-ID reservation at lane-open (meta-swarm target)

## S404f session note (DOMEX-META-S404: classify_actionability() in enforcement_router.py — L-878)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-META-S404 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: meta (4.1) hardening
- **expect**: actionable ASPIRATIONAL ~120-150 of 244 total; orient.py shows filtered actionable gap
- **actual**: 121/244 actionable (49.6%) — within expected range. True gap 41.7% (was 84% raw). Classifier: imperative verb at any sentence start, `must` modal, Fix:/Wire: prefix, backtick code, colon-imperative. L-878 + artifact written.
- **diff**: 121 actionable (expected 120-150, CONFIRMED). Concurrent session (S404b) already wired orient.py before I could. My enforcement_router.py changes were the building block they used.
- **meta-swarm**: High-concurrency sessions duplicated orient.py wiring effort — both DOMEX-META-S404 and S404b touched the same consumer. Concrete target: check.sh near-dup guard should flag concurrent DOMEX lanes in same domain+frontier.
- **State**: 792L 196P 20B 16F | L-878 | classify_actionability() shipped | enforcement_router.py actionable_gap_rate live
- **Next**: (1) Challenge execution periodic (21s overdue); (2) Health check periodic (overdue); (3) lane_history.py git-log helper (broken ref in NEXT.md)

## S404e session note (DOMEX-META-S404b: F-META2 actionable filter wiring + SIG-45 + economy health)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-META-S404b (MERGED) | **dispatch**: meta (4.1)
- **expect**: Actionable classifier reduces misleading ASPIRATIONAL count by 30-40% in orient.py display.
- **actual**: orient.py prescription gap changed from 72% (raw ASPIRATIONAL) to 33% (actionable only). 54% reduction exceeded prediction. Top gap now L-533 (actionable) instead of L-722 (observational). SIG-45 resolved (session_classifier.py → CORE_SWARM_TOOLS). Economy health: HEALTHY (proxy-K 0.01%, velocity stable, no interventions).
- **diff**: Predicted 30-40% reduction, got 54%. 60% of ASPIRATIONAL are observational (expected ~50%). Economy health check confirmed no issues.
- **maintenance**: DOMEX-META-S404 stale lane closed ABANDONED. State-sync run. Economy-health periodic completed.
- **meta-swarm**: New capability (actionable classifier) built by concurrent session but orient.py consumer not updated = downstream lag. Same pattern as L-874 (format evolution without consumer update). Concrete target: test that verifies orient.py consumes `actionable_gap_rate` field. Target: enforcement_router.py test or check.sh.
- **State**: 791L 196P 20B 16F | DOMEX-META-S404b MERGED | economy HEALTHY
- **Next**: (1) Challenge execution periodic (21 sessions overdue, last S383); (2) lane_history.py git-log helper; (3) Health check periodic (due ~S403+5); (4) Fundamental-setup-reswarm (due ~S400+5)

## S404d session note (compaction + TTL triage + F-GT1 hardening + F-EVAL1 reconfirm — L-877)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lanes**: DOMEX-GT-S404 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: graph-theory (3.2) + evaluation reconfirm
- **expect**: Proxy-K <6% after FRONTIER/DEPS trim. Alpha continues diverging. F-EVAL1 Protect stays 1/3.
- **actual**: Proxy-K 6.82%→3.8% (FRONTIER TTL triage + DEPS compression). Alpha 1.645→1.657 (STABILIZED, divergence stopped). L-601 hub 60→121 (+102%). F-EVAL1 post-compact: 2.25/3 (Protect lifted 1→2). Economy health: stable (0.98L/s, 91% throughput, proxy-K 6.82% DUE → 3.6% healthy).
- **diff**: Expected alpha divergence: FALSIFIED (stabilized). Expected Protect stays 1/3: FALSIFIED (compaction lifted it). NEXT.md compacted 135→10 lines. 5 TTL-S404 frontiers processed (3 ABANDONED, 1 RESOLVED, 1 MERGED into F-SUB1). 21→16 active frontiers.
- **meta-swarm**: post-edit-validate.py hook misreported pipe-separated DEPS.md fields as "circular dependency" — parser confusion not real cycle. Concrete target: tools/hooks/post-edit-validate.py field parser improvement.
- **State**: ~790L 201P 20B 16F | proxy-K 3.8% | F-EVAL1 2.25/3 | L-877 | L-873 updated
- **Next**: (1) Health check periodic (DUE S403+5); (2) Mission constraint reswarm (overdue); (3) F-GT1 consider RESOLUTION (4 waves, alpha stable); (4) lane_history.py git-log helper
