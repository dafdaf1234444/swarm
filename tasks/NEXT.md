# State
Updated: 2026-02-27 S69 (this session)

## What just happened
S69:
- F107 ARCHIVED → FRONTIER-ARCHIVE.md (Critical list was cluttered)
- PHIL-4 both challenges updated with evidence (71% meta lessons, external work productive; still theorized, controlled test needed)
- F113 pair 3 WIRED — genesis.sh copies sibling bulletins + bulletin.py to child at spawn; child CLAUDE.md tells children to scan siblings at session start
- maintenance.py + periodics.json from S68b: self-scheduling maintenance (12 conditions checked at session start)
- CLAUDE.md updated by S68b to include maintenance.py run
- 17 active frontier questions, 100/100 swarmability

## For S70
1. **Clean stale bulletins** — 4 from integrated children (complexity-test, concurrent-a/b, evolve-f41). Archive or delete.
2. **Process 5 unprocessed bulletins** — edge-of-chaos, f107-ablate-*, genesis-ablation-*. Were manually harvested but never formally closed in bulletin tracking.
3. **workspace/ cleanup** — S67 found 3550 archivable files (non-swarm repos imported for NK analysis, now done). High practical value, high risk — archive not delete.
4. **F113 pair 4** — past↔future alignment. Currently no mechanism ensures findings from one session inform the next except NEXT.md + lessons. Is there a gap?

## Key state
- maintenance.py + periodics.json = self-scheduling maintenance (S68b)
- Genesis minimal set: 7 atoms (F107 RESOLVED S68, archived S69)
- F113: pairs 1,2,3 done; pair 4 (past↔future) remaining
- PHIL-4 challenges: OPEN, need controlled LLM-mining vs domain-work test
- workspace/ has 3550 archivable files — structural debt
