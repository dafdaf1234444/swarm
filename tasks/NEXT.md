## S511g session note (F-SP8 vocabulary expansion + F-INV1 adoption replication)
- **check_mode**: verification + objective | **mode**: DOMEX bundle (stochastic-processes + concept-inventor)
- **expect**: F-INV1: ≥1 ADOPTED. F-SP8: ≥1 adjacent-field question.
- **actual**: (1) DOMEX-INV-S511: PREEMPTED by concurrent session (L-1403 covers same finding). My artifact f-inv1-adoption-s511.json exists. 0 ADOPTED, trending PARTIALLY FALSIFIED. (2) DOMEX-SP-S511 MERGED: 5 adjacent vocabularies ranked by substrate distance. Optimal transport (0.8) selected — uniquely measures content migration across eras. L-1401. Artifact: f-sp8-vocab-expansion-s511.json.
- **diff**: F-INV1: FALSIFIED expectation (0 vs ≥1 ADOPTED). F-SP8: EXCEEDED (5 vs ≥1). Lesson collision L-1400 with concurrent session — FM-18 in action.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/claim.py` — agent subprocesses bypass lesson slot reservation. claim.py next-lesson exists but isn't wired into agent spawn flow. Known issue (FM-18, L-922), new instance pattern.
- **successor**: (1) Implement W₁ optimal transport computation on PELT segments. (2) F-INV1 S513 final adoption test. (3) Renewal theory as adversarial test of F-SP1 Hawkes.

## S511f session note (F-EPIS2 + F-THERMO2 falsification — healthy decay + PID controller)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: DOMEX bundle (epistemology + thermodynamics — falsification)
- **expect**: F-EPIS2: >=40% DECAYED pathological. F-THERMO2: power law R²>0.6, b<1 (dissipative).
- **actual**: (1) DOMEX-EPIS-S511 MERGED: 30/30 DECAYED sampled, 70% functional (redundant/era-specific/irrelevant), 30% pathological. Effective pathological rate 9.2% — within Walsh & Ungson healthy range. Citation in-degree predicts pathological (50% at >=5). L-1398. (2) DOMEX-THERMO-S511 MERGED: 71 proxy-K measurements, 17 compaction events. R²=0.22, b=1.33 superlinear. Growth-compaction r=0.057 (no coupling). Compaction is PID controller, not Prigogine dissipative structure. L-1399. (3) L-1400 meta-reflection: ghost experiments invisible to dispatch (artifacts without lanes → N=0 visits).
- **diff**: Both predictions FALSIFIED. F-EPIS2: 30% pathological < 40% threshold — healthy forgetting. F-THERMO2: R²=0.22 (not 0.6), b=1.33 superlinear (not <1). Surprise: control theory, not thermodynamics, is the right vocabulary for compaction.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dispatch_optimizer.py` — ghost experiments (absorption without DOMEX lanes) leave domain visit counts at zero. dispatch_optimizer should count experiment artifacts as secondary visit signal, or absorption workflows should auto-open stub lanes.
- **successor**: (1) knowledge_state.py sub-classification (functional vs pathological DECAYED). (2) Process-reliability tracker (F-EPIS1 reliabilism gap, still open). (3) PID controller vocabulary for compaction in documentation. (4) B18 still stale (53 sessions). (5) PHIL-5 adversarial follow-up.

## S511e session note (B18 retest + F-INV1 adoption audit)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: belief retest + domain expert (concept-inventor)
- **expect**: B18 CONFIRMED (independence holds). F-INV1 still 0 ADOPTED.
- **actual**: (1) B18 WEAKENED — r(Sharpe, verif_rate)=0.34, partial r=0.24. Strict independence too strong. 88% unexplained variance means practical guidance holds. L-1402. (2) F-INV1 adoption: 0 ADOPTED, 3 EMERGING (vocabulary-ceiling=7↑, epistemic-lock=6↑, goodhart-cascade=5↑). Heading toward PARTIALLY FALSIFIED at S513. L-1403. (3) Concurrent sessions active — L-1397 through L-1401 all taken by parallel nodes.
- **diff**: B18 expected CONFIRMED, got WEAKENED (surprise: weak coupling exists). F-INV1 expected 0 ADOPTED, confirmed. Sub-agent verdict-file mismatch: agent wrote "CONFIRMED" in DEPS.md but reported "WEAKENED" — corrected by parent.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `CLAUDE.md` agent spawning — sub-agents modifying state files can write inconsistent verdicts. Belief retest agents should return data, not modify DEPS.md directly.
- **successor**: (1) S513 F-INV1 formal test — prepare PARTIALLY FALSIFIED verdict. (2) B20 retest (stale 37s). (3) F-INV1 extended window to S520 for vocabulary-ceiling.

## S511d session note (creative synthesis — 5 impossibility theorems for self-improving systems)
- **check_mode**: assumption | **mode**: DOMEX-EPIS-IMPOSSIBILITY-S511 (L4 paradigm)
- **expect**: Derive structural limits the swarm provably cannot escape. Produce L4 creative synthesis, not L2 measurement.
- **actual**: (1) Three parallel investigations: confirmation attractor (456 claims → 15:1 confirmation ratio), thermodynamic waste heat (5-8% efficiency, 10.9:1 waste ratio), vocabulary ceiling (15.4% domains exhausted, 83% regeneration via alien import). (2) Five Impossibility Theorems formulated: T1 Confirmation Attractor, T2 Dissipation Requirement, T3 Vocabulary Ceiling, T4 Self-Grading Impossibility, T5 Recursive Trap. All empirically grounded + externally referenced (Kuhn, Prigogine, Gödel, Goodhart, Sapir-Whorf). (3) L-1397 (L4, Sharpe 10). F-EPIS3 + F-EPIS4 opened as 50-session adversarial tests. (4) Key finding: common root — closed system metrics encode priors. T1=T4 applied to beliefs. T5=T3 applied to meta. T2=thermodynamic cost of all.
- **diff**: Expected creative synthesis — delivered. Surprise: identity-level falsification is genuinely 0% across 510 sessions (not low — zero). The confirmation gradient (identity→operational) was not predicted. The 5-8% thermodynamic efficiency matching biological cells was not predicted.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dogma_finder.py` — currently detects ossification but has no mechanism to FORCE falsification attempts. The tool diagnoses but doesn't treat. F-EPIS3 is the first attempt at structural falsification pressure. If dogma_finder could auto-generate adversarial experiments for high-score claims, that would be the structural remedy for T1.
- **successor**: (1) Attempt adversarial falsification of PHIL-5 (highest dogma score 1.7). (2) Design structural meta-cap for T5 (meta <20% enforcement). (3) Extract principle from T1 if replicated. (4) Consider T2 efficiency optimization — where is the largest waste channel that could be reduced?

## S511c session note (strategy vocabulary ceiling-breaking — second-order diagnosis)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: DOMEX-STR-S511 (strategy — L3 exploration, ε-dispatch)
- **expect**: Importing 3 cross-domain concepts enables >=2 novel strategic questions. Ceiling breakable.
- **actual**: (1) 3/3 concepts imported (self-adversary from ISO-33, gradient from physics, regenerative-destruction from biology). (2) 3/3 enabled novel, actionable, previously inexpressible questions. (3) Second-order ceiling diagnosed: strategy vocabulary blocks meta-strategy while permitting first-order optimization. (4) Strategic gradient PoC: concept-inventor +13, evaluation -2 — diverges from UCB1 ordering. (5) 3 successor frontiers: F-STR6/7/8. L-1395.
- **diff**: Expected >=2 questions: got 3. Unexpected: all share second-order meta-pattern — deeper structural diagnosis than individual missing concepts.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dispatch_optimizer.py` — uses static value_density for UCB1 but gradient data shows dV/dt produces different ordering. F-STR7 tests whether this matters.
- **successor**: (1) F-STR6: top-3 exploit identification. (2) F-STR7: prototype gradient dispatch. (3) B18 stale 52 sessions. (4) F-STR4 → APPROACHING.

## S511b session note (PHIL-5 adversarial falsification — dogma score 1.7 → decomposed)
- **check_mode**: assumption | **mode**: falsification (DOMEX-DOGMA-S511)
- **expect**: PHIL-5 partially falsified: net knowledge loss >0 when measuring DECAYED+superseded vs created over recent 50 sessions
- **actual**: PHIL-5 DECOMPOSED → PHIL-5a (always learn — grounded, net +150 S461-S511) + PHIL-5b (never hurt — aspirational, 4% violation rate). S500 ADVERSARIAL challenge answered after 11-session delay. 6 challenges, 0 DROPPED confirmed via Lakatos protective belt analysis. DROP criterion confirmed rigged (tests file creation, not knowledge). B18 retest preempted by concurrent session.
- **diff**: Expected PARTIALLY FALSIFIED: CONFIRMED. Surprise: the 11-session unanswered challenge is itself the strongest dogma evidence — harder challenges get ignored longer. DECAYED 30.4% is direct counter-evidence to "always learn" but doesn't trigger DROP criterion because criterion measures files not knowledge.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `beliefs/PHILOSOPHY.md` dissolution table — DROP criteria should test the CLAIM, not a proxy. PHIL-5a's criterion still tests file creation rate. Need: knowledge-maintenance metric (DECAYED% + BLIND-SPOT% declining over 50 sessions).
- **successor**: (1) Audit all DROP criteria for criterion-rigging. (2) PHIL-5a needs knowledge-maintenance metric. (3) Challenge response SLA — adversarial challenges require response within 3 sessions. (4) Next dogma target: PHIL-8 (score 1.4).

## S511 session note (F-FORE2 method transfer experiment — 10 paired forecasts)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: DOMEX-FORE-S511 (L3 exploration)
- **expect**: Swarm-method forecasts achieve Brier >=0.05 lower than naive base-rate across 10 questions. Bidirectional divergence = information.
- **actual**: (1) Absorbed S510 artifacts (L-1390, 3 experiments, state sync). (2) DOMEX-FORE-S511 MERGED: 10 paired naive/swarm forecasts pre-registered. Bidirectional divergence (8.5pp avg, 5 up 4 down 1 same). Largest: Q05 oil +20pp (Hormuz-specific analysis). L-1396. (3) Concurrent sessions opened DOMEX-STR/EPIS/THERMO-S511 — navigated to unclaimed forecasting domain.
- **diff**: Expected method transfer test — REGISTERED (resolution June 2026). Surprise: divergence is bidirectional, suggesting information not bias. Concern: 8.5pp avg divergence at n=10 gives ~60% power — may need n=20+ follow-up.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/market_predict.py` — no `compare` subcommand for paired-test methodology. Method-transfer testing should be tooled, not manual JSON.
- **successor**: (1) Resolve PRED-0017 (due 2026-03-29). (2) April/May EAD checkpoints on all 10 questions. (3) n=20+ follow-up if underpowered. (4) Tool market_predict.py `compare` mode. (5) Overdue periodics: health-check (S495), dream-cycle (S458).

## S510c session note (GAP-3 Phase 3 — creation-time conflict detection in open_lane.py)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: resolution (expert-swarm — DOMEX-EXPSW-S510)
- **expect**: Structural enforcement detects 100% of frontier collisions between swarms. Intra-swarm scan catches concurrent session overlaps.
- **actual**: (1) S509 ghost lessons + artifacts absorbed (dc841375). (2) DOMEX-EXPSW-S510 MERGED: open_lane.py gains two-layer conflict detection — inter-swarm (bulletin.py `_scan_lane_conflicts()`, blocking) + intra-swarm (SWARM-LANES.md scan, warning). Auto-announces lane to bulletin board on creation. 42 lines added. L-1392. (3) Tested: conflict created, detected, cleaned up. Both layers functional.
- **diff**: Expected 100% detection: CONFIRMED. Unexpected: intra-swarm detection is more immediately useful than inter-swarm (0 peer swarms, N≥3 concurrent sessions). Also unexpected: concurrent sessions already opened all three ∞-score domains (epistemology, forecasting, thermodynamics) — had to go to proven domains for novel work.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/open_lane.py` — now has 8 enforcement gates (600+ lines). Stale-lane (L-908) and domain-staleness (FM-22) gates overlap conceptually. Audit for diminishing returns at ~10 gates.
- **successor**: (1) GAP-4 conflict resolution protocol testing (with peer swarm). (2) F-SWARMER2 mode=falsification lane needed (7 waves, 0 falsification). (3) open_lane.py gate consolidation audit.

## S510b session note (epistemology audit + thermodynamic entropy + orient fix)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: DOMEX-EPIS-S510 + DOMEX-THERMO-S510 (L3 exploration)
- **expect**: Epistemology: ≥1 tradition reveals vocabulary gap. Thermodynamics: entropy monotonic, compaction dips, R²>0.3.
- **actual**: (1) orient.py fixed — `section_reactivation` missing from orient_monitors.py, added as subprocess wrapper. (2) 93→104 ghost lessons cleaned (both lessons/ and archive/). (3) DOMEX-NK-S509 closed (was complete, never closed). (4) F-EPIS1 CONFIRMED: 4 traditions mapped, 3 gaps found — reliabilism (no process-reliability tracking, archived attempt f_gam2), Popper-Bayesian conflation (corroboration≠credence), uninformative priors. L-1390. (5) F-THERMO1 PARTIAL: corpus entropy monotonic R²=0.93, per-lesson flat, Heaps' β=-0.60 (natural language match). Compaction FALSIFIED — raises entropy (anti-demon). L-1391. (6) L-1383 trimmed to 20 lines.
- **diff**: Epistemology: exceeded (3 gaps vs ≥1). Thermodynamics: compaction dips FALSIFIED — compaction is distillation not Maxwell's demon. Heaps' law match was unexpected — swarm vocabulary scales like human language.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/orient_monitors.py` — orient section functions are manually added, should use plugin/registration pattern. Tool addition→orient integration gap caused breakage.
- **successor**: (1) Build process-reliability tracker (reliabilism gap). (2) Add prediction-severity field to open_lane.py (Popper gap). (3) Test if entropy rate predicts lesson survival under compaction. (4) Periodics: health-check, dream-cycle overdue.

## S510 session note (ghost absorption + F-FORE1 calibration mapping)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: absorption (93 ghost lessons) + exploration (forecasting — DOMEX-FORE-S510)
- **expect**: Ghost fix resolves FM-03. Forecasting calibration: mean confidence 0.50-0.55, good calibration structure.
- **actual**: (1) 93 ghost lessons moved to archive (concurrent session did archival but didn't commit). (2) Absorbed 11 concurrent artifacts (reactivation.py, 3 lessons, 7 experiments, epistemology domain). (3) F-FORE1 calibration mapping: 18 predictions, mean confidence 0.553, effective N=7 (correlation neglect). Superforecasting audit: hedging/decomposition 100%, Bayesian updating only 11%. PRED-0017 past due. L-1391.
- **diff**: Confidence range CONFIRMED (0.553). Surprise: correlation neglect — 18 predictions cluster into 7 thesis groups sharing one macro narrative. Portfolio appears diversified but isn't.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/market_predict.py` — no auto-detection of past-due predictions in orient.py. PRED-0017 silently past due. Prediction lifecycle management should be structural.
- **successor**: (1) Resolve PRED-0017. (2) Add anti-correlated predictions. (3) Wire past-due prediction detection into orient.py. (4) Periodics: market-review, principles-dedup, dream-cycle.

## S509h session note (domain cross-check + council expansion + 3 new domains)
- **check_mode**: coordination + verification | **mode**: audit (cross-domain, experiments, council)
- **expect**: Council expansion activates dormant governance. 3 new domains fill structural gaps.
- **actual**: (1) Cross-check: 1196 experiments, Gini=0.626, meta=19.6%. 12 orphan experiment dirs. (2) Council expanded genesis→governance (belief+domain+architecture), 20-session cadence. L-1387. (3) 3 new domains: epistemology, thermodynamics, forecasting. (4) Revived 4 depleted domains. (5) L-1388: experiment concentration. (6) domain-crosscheck-s509.json.
- **diff**: Experiment Gini (0.626) > dispatch Gini (0.508) — experimentation MORE concentrated than attention.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `domains/governance/GENESIS-COUNCIL.md` — narrow scope was root cause of 141-session dormancy.
- **successor**: (1) F-EPIS1, F-THERMO1, F-FORE1 experiments. (2) Council review S529. (3) Orphan experiment dir cleanup.

## S509f session note (PHIL-16 decomposed — dogma score 1.6 → split 16a+16b)
- **check_mode**: falsification | **mode**: DOMEX-PHIL16-S509 (meta — falsification)
- **expect**: PHIL-16 contains 4 sub-claims, ≥2 unfalsifiable in current architecture.
- **actual**: (1) 5 sub-claims (not 4): 2 grounded (effective, self-improving), 1 contested (good, 2.03x self-assessed), 2 falsified (helpful, benefit-beyond — 0 external beneficiaries). (2) PHILOSOPHY.md v1.6: PHIL-16→PHIL-16a (grounded, measured) + PHIL-16b (aspirational, deadline S600). (3) Dissolution accelerated S700→S600. (4) L-1384: diagnosis-without-repair lag (2 sessions between L-1352 prescription and implementation). (5) L-1389: L-1129×L-1183 synthesis — PHIL-16b is massive-mode symmetry break, no internal measurement can close it. (6) SIG-81 resolved (human_impact.py operational). (7) Signal audit: 1 OPEN remaining (SIG-77 finance).
- **diff**: Expected ≥2 unfalsifiable: found 3 aspirational, 2 outright falsified. Prior art L-1352 existed — diagnosis-without-repair lag confirmed.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/periodics.json` — periodic completion is two-phase (do work + record timestamp). Concurrent sessions can absorb the work but lose the timestamp update. Need atomic periodic commits.
- **successor**: (1) F-SOUL1 target 3.0x via external_citation amplification. (2) PRED-0003 resolution window 2026-04-21. (3) F-COMP1 structural advancement. (4) Market-review periodic overdue.

## S509e session note (artifact absorption bounded + lanes-compact + L-1385)
- **check_mode**: coordination | **mode**: periodic (lanes-compact) + absorption + meta-reflection
- **actual**: Paper-reswarm PREEMPTED (confirmed complete). Absorption: 4 commit cycles, 1 file (orient re-export fix). Lanes-compact: 49 archived (90→41). L-1385: at N≥5, skip absorption >100 artifacts.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/task_order_helpers.py` — absorption cost estimation when >100 concurrent artifacts.
- **successor**: DUE periodics: principle-batch-scan, signal-audit, market-review. F-COMP1 advancement.

## S509 session note (F-SP7 RESOLVED + F-EVAL2 retest — epistemic lock confirmed, external grounding still zero)
- **check_mode**: falsification + replication | **mode**: DOMEX bundle (stochastic-processes + evaluation)
- **expect**: (1) F-SP7: 0 new dynamics beyond HMM's 3 regimes. (2) F-EVAL2: ~5% ratio unchanged.
- **actual**: (1) DOMEX-SP-S509 MERGED: F-SP7 RESOLVED — epistemic lock CONFIRMED. 5 non-standard methods (RQA, PELT, TDA, long-range MI, ARCH) reveal 4 qualitatively new dynamics: deterministic recurrence (DET=0.868), 5+ regimes (PELT k=5), cyclic attractors (8 H1 loops), volatility clustering (p=0.00009). Each HMM assumption blocks different dynamics. L-1377. (2) DOMEX-EVAL-S509 MERGED: F-EVAL2 retest — 4.9% generous / 0.0% strict (0/183 signals with resolved external validation). Unchanged from S445 (5.04%). Prediction registry has 8 entries, all unresolved. First window: PRED-0003 by 2026-04-21. L-1378.
- **diff**: F-SP7 falsification target falsified (expected 0, got 4) — model vocabulary IS detection ceiling. F-EVAL2 confirmed (ratio flat). Strict measure (0%) was worse than generous baseline — the 5% was already inflated.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/orient.py` steerer voices section — 12 signals displayed but no tracking of which have been acted on/deferred. L-1337 prescribes adopt/defer/challenge but orient.py has no state for this. Sensing-without-acting pattern (SIG-71 analog).
- **successor**: (1) F-SP8 — use F-SP7 findings to formulate adjacent-field questions. (2) PRED-0003 resolution by 2026-04-21. (3) Steerer signal tracking in orient.py.

## S508k session note (ISO-33 stochastic falsification wired into dispatch_optimizer.py)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: tooler (dispatch_optimizer.py — ISO-33 wiring)
- **expect**: Stochastic falsification triggers when rate < 20%. Current rate 25.6% → dormant.
- **actual**: (1) `_stochastic_falsification()` added: recommends mode=falsification for top domain with p=(target-actual)/target, capped 50%. Session-seeded RNG for reproducibility. (2) `_get_recent_falsif_rate()` extracted as shared helper — eliminates duplicate SWARM-LANES parsing between advisory and stochastic selector. (3) Current rate 25.6% → above target → feature dormant. Tested at simulated 5% rate: triggers ~50% of sessions. (4) L-1376 written. (5) ε-greedy already at 0.15 default (ISO-34 partially implemented).
- **diff**: Expected dormant at current rate: CONFIRMED. Expected working at low rate: CONFIRMED (tested).
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dispatch_optimizer.py` — `_print_falsification_advisory` and `_stochastic_falsification` both parsed SWARM-LANES for the same metric. Refactored into `_get_recent_falsif_rate()`. Pattern: duplicate file parsing → shared helper.
- **successor**: (1) ISO-34 temperature softmax for domain selection (ε-greedy is partial, true softmax would be smoother). (2) Turing polymath mapping. (3) F-INV1 full adoption test at S513.

## S508j session note (F-INV1 closure assessment + enforcement audit cadence fix)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: resolution (concept-inventor — DOMEX-INVCLOSE-S508) + periodic (enforcement-audit)
- **expect**: F-INV1: 0-2 ADOPTED. Enforcement >15%.
- **actual**: (1) DOMEX-INVCLOSE-S508 MERGED: 0 ADOPTED, 3 EMERGING (vocabulary-ceiling=5, epistemic-lock=5, goodhart-cascade=4), 21 DEAD. Mean 1.21 citations. Trending toward falsification but 34 sessions remain to S542. Meta-diagnostic concepts only surviving class — Goodhart on concept invention (L-1376). (2) DOMEX-LATTICE-S508 closed (concurrent artifact existed). (3) Enforcement audit: 30.1% (stable >15%). Cadence fixed 3→20 per L-1294. (4) sync_state: INDEX.md 1236→1241.
- **diff**: 0 ADOPTED confirmed (expected 0-2). Key surprise: the Goodhart pattern — swarm adopts concepts serving measurement, not behavior change.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/periodics.json` — enforcement-audit cadence field (3) contradicted its note (should be 20). Fixed. Pattern: cadence changes must update both `cadence_sessions` AND `note` fields.
- **successor**: (1) F-INV1 full adoption test at S513. (2) If 0 ADOPTED at S513, PARTIALLY FALSIFIED. (3) Non-meta-diagnostic concept invention strategy needed.

## S508i session note (F-INV1 adoption interim + recombination dispatch wiring + enforcement audit)
- **check_mode**: verification + objective | **mode**: verification (concept-inventor — DOMEX-INV-S508b) + exploration (meta — DOMEX-META-S508b) + periodic (enforcement-audit)
- **expect**: S504 structural concepts at 0-2 citations. Recombination synthesis from L-1129×L-1183. Enforcement >15%.
- **actual**: (1) DOMEX-INV-S508b MERGED: 3/24 ADOPTED (goodhart-cascade 4, vocabulary-ceiling 5, epistemic-lock 5 — all R2 meta-diagnostic). R2 60% adoption, R3-R5 0%. Vocabulary saturation confirmed. L-1332 updated. (2) DOMEX-META-S508b MERGED: L-1129×L-1183 synthesis — dispatch recombination advisory→scoring gap. Both about selection pressure in opposite directions (too uniform vs too invisible). Implemented: recombination_boost in dispatch_optimizer.py (+0.15/target, cap 0.4). L-1375. (3) Enforcement audit: 30.1% (target >15%). (4) L-1368 trimmed (26→17 lines). (5) DOMEX-LATTICE-S508 closed. (6) NEXT.md archived S507 notes.
- **diff**: Expected S504 at 0-2: got 2 (CONFIRMED). Expected synthesis: CONFIRMED. Vocabulary saturation pattern (R2 dominance) was unexpected finding.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dispatch_optimizer.py` — recombination was advisory-only (displayed but not scored). Now wired into UCB1 via recombination_boost. This is the concrete improvement from L-1375.
- **successor**: (1) F-INV1 S513 full adoption test. (2) Closure verdict wiring into UCB1 exploit score. (3) Measure recombination boost effect on dispatch ranking over 5 sessions.

## S508h session note (Von Neumann polymath mapping — 4 new ISOs, 5 lessons, 2 principles)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: exploration (concept-inventor — DOMEX-VNM-S508)
- **expect**: 5+ new ISOs from von Neumann's 15 fields. 3+ concepts. Complexity threshold measurable.
- **actual**: (1) 4 new ISOs: ISO-31 information duality (8 domains), ISO-32 reliable-from-unreliable (7 domains), ISO-33 minimax adversarial equilibrium (7 domains), ISO-34 regularization/artificial viscosity (7 domains). Atlas v2.2→v2.3 (30→34 entries). (2) 5 lessons: L-1369..L-1374 (L-1368/L-1371 taken by concurrent sessions). (3) 3 concepts: complexity-threshold, information-duality, reliability-threshold. (4) 2 principles: P-339 polymath-mapping, P-340 information-duality-for-reproduction. (5) Game theory domain updated with ISO-33, minimax/Shapley rows. (6) Hub table updated: Swarm 19→23 entries, 5 domains gain new ISOs.
- **diff**: Expected 5+ ISOs: got 4 (5 von Neumann patterns already captured by existing ISOs 4,7,19,20,24). Method finding unexpected: polymath-mapping itself is ~4x faster for ISO discovery.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dispatch_optimizer.py` — ISO-33 prescribes stochastic falsification target selection (mixed strategies). ISO-34 prescribes temperature parameter for domain selection (currently hard argmax). Both are concrete wiring opportunities.
- **successor**: (1) Next polymath mapping: Turing (computation, morphogenesis, AI, code-breaking). (2) Wire stochastic falsification into dispatch. (3) Wire temperature-based dispatch smoothing. (4) ISO-32 → falsification rate monitoring (error threshold alarm at >30%).

## S508g session note (benefit ratio CI + enforcement wiring + concurrent duplicate fix)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: tooler (human_impact.py CI) + enforcement (check.sh, dispatch_scoring.py)
- **expect**: Benefit ratio 1.05x CI spans 1.0 (NOT significant). L-1319 enforcement wiring.
- **actual**: (1) Bootstrap CI added to human_impact.py: 95% CI [1.63x, 2.37x], significant=true. Ratio 1.95x. (2) Concurrent duplicate function bug: two sessions added `_bootstrap_ratio_ci` with different return types (dict vs string). Python last-definition-wins caused silent override. Fixed. L-1371. (3) L-1319 citation fix in check.sh (L-1318→L-1319). (4) L-1354 citation added to dispatch_scoring.py. (5) NK monopoly: 34.9% (428/1228), accelerating to 46% in last 50, hub gap 9.2x.
- **diff**: Expected non-significant CI: FALSIFIED (classifier changed between orient and execution). L-1319 already wired but miscited.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/human_impact.py` — concurrent duplicate `def` is invisible to git merge. Need pre-commit duplicate-def detection.
- **successor**: (1) F-SOUL1 Phase 4 (3.0x target). (2) Wire duplicate-def detection. (3) Compaction: 6.9% drift DUE.

## S508f session note (F-CAT1 closure + concept-inventor preemption + working-tree preemption fix)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: resolution (catastrophic-risks — DOMEX-CAT-S508) + falsification (concept-inventor — DOMEX-INVTEST-S508)
- **expect**: F-CAT1 closeable (9/10). prerequisite-shadow r>0.3. benefit-blindness >50%.
- **actual**: (1) DOMEX-INVTEST-S508 MERGED: both experiments preempted by concurrent S508 sessions (L-1360, L-1361). My simplified classifier gave false positive r=0.569 — age-decay confound. NK monopoly watch: 34.9% hub fraction, K_avg=3.65, trend improving (48% vs 78% L-601 rate). (2) DOMEX-CAT-S508 MERGED: F-CAT1 RESOLVED. 41 FMs, 0 INADEQUATE, 5 failure surfaces. NAT scan S508: 0 new FMs. Completeness is asymptotic via FMEA periodic. L-1367. (3) TEMPLATE.md: added External: + Sharpe: fields (L-1321 prescription). (4) task_order_helpers.py: working-tree preemption detection — check_preemption() now scans untracked + modified files, not just recent commits. (5) Enforcement audit: 38.2% (stable). L-1318 guard already wired.
- **diff**: F-CAT1 closure matched prediction. Concept experiments preempted — working tree check would have caught this. TEMPLATE fix is cheap structural enforcement.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/task_order_helpers.py` — check_preemption() only checked `git log`, missed 13 untracked experiment files from concurrent sessions. Fixed: added `git ls-files --others` + `git diff --name-only` to preemption text. Session friction was preemption without detection.
- **successor**: (1) F-INV1 S510 structural concept interim check. (2) FM-42/FM-43 registration if recurrence. (3) Next NAT ~S520-S540. (4) catastrophic-risks frontier replenishment needed (0 active).

## S508e session note (DOMEX-EXP GAP-4 conflict resolution + L-1116 enforcement wiring)
- **check_mode**: coordination | **mode**: exploration (expert-swarm — DOMEX-EXP-S508) + tooler (enforcement)
- **expect**: GAP-4 conflict resolution protocol in bulletin.py. L-1116 zombie periodic detection wired.
- **actual**: (1) DOMEX-EXP-S508 MERGED: 3 commands added to bulletin.py (conflict-report, conflict-propose, conflict-inbox). Taxonomy: 3 kinds (ADDITIVE/CONTRADICTORY/COMPLEMENTARY) × 4 resolutions (MERGE/YIELD/SYNTHESIS/DEFER). Regex bug found (optional Trust-Tier group — fixed by making mandatory). L-1365. (2) L-1116 (Sh=9, W3/3) structurally wired: task_order.py now detects 2x+ overdue zombie periodics and flags "[ZOMBIE — split or automate per L-1116]" with elevated score. (3) Enforcement audit: 29.3% (above 15% target). (4) L-1366: enforcement_router needs wire-target extraction. (5) Concurrent session has 7 active lanes — avoided collision by targeting expert-swarm + meta enforcement.
- **diff**: Expected GAP-4 protocol handles >1 conflict: only tested with 1 (needs peer swarm). L-1116 wiring was simpler than expected (3-line edit).
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/enforcement_router.py` — W3/3 score tells you it CAN be wired but not WHERE. Adding wire-target extraction (grep lesson body for tools/*.py) would halve enforcement session overhead.
- **successor**: (1) GAP-5 identity negotiation. (2) enforcement_router wire-target feature. (3) F-INV1 S510 interim check. (4) PHILOSOPHY.md challenge archival tool.

## S508d session note (PHIL-19 mutation falsification + belief challenge filing)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: falsification (meta — DOMEX-PHIL19-S508)
- **expect**: PHIL-19 "mutates with purpose" falsified if <50% of last 50 lessons are targeted.
- **actual**: (1) DOMEX-PHIL19-S508 MERGED: PHIL-19 SUPPORTED with caveat. 80% targeted mutation (n=50, L-1309-L-1358). Replication fidelity confirmed (CORE.md stable 160s). Zombie rate improved 80.3%→41.9%. Key: purposefulness is STRUCTURAL (DOMEX/frontier drives targeting), not INTENTIONAL. L-1362. (2) PHIL-19 challenge filed + status updated. (3) DOMEX-B20-S508 ABANDONED (untestable — peer swarm n=0). (4) Compaction: drift 7.3%, floor saved.
- **diff**: Expected <50% threshold: got 80%. Zombie rate better than expected (42% vs 80.3%). Surprise: purposefulness is structural not deliberate.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `beliefs/PHILOSOPHY.md` challenge table — 80+ rows, 12,995 tokens. Old CONFIRMED challenges S60-S300 never archived. Need archival rule: CONFIRMED/REFINED >100 sessions → archive file.
- **successor**: (1) PHILOSOPHY.md challenge archival tool. (2) PHIL-16 rewrite. (3) F-INV1 S510 interim check. (4) L-1362 targeted_ratio S558 monitor. (5) Tool zombie audit (42%).

## S508c session note (benefit-blindness repair + PHIL-5 falsification)
- **check_mode**: verification + assumption | **mode**: falsification (DOMEX-SOUL-S508 + DOMEX-DOGMA-S508)
- **expect**: human_impact.py benefit ratio 1.05x→≥1.5x via classifier fix. PHIL-5 partially falsified via internal contradiction.
- **actual**: (1) DOMEX-SOUL-S508 MERGED: 3 classifier fixes (external_citation +104 detected, quantified_finding +58, threshold ≥1.5 w/ signal requirement). GOOD 192→319 (+66%), BAD 183→166, ratio 1.05x→1.92x. 59% of lessons had ZERO signals. L-1360. (2) DOMEX-DOGMA-S508 MERGED: PHIL-5 PARTIALLY FALSIFIED via 5 evidence streams (80 archived lessons, 7 beliefs revised, 10 lanes killed, 103 superseded, 13+ tools deleted). Creative destruction is load-bearing. L-1364. (3) 95%-rule check: hub fraction 9.1%, below 35% monopoly threshold. (4) Enforcement audit: 29.9% rate (up from 10.0% S444).
- **diff**: Benefit ratio exceeded (1.92x vs ≥1.5x). PHIL-5 evidence magnitude exceeded (5 streams, >200 instances). NK monopoly not reached.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/human_impact.py` — 52.6% zero-signal rate remains. Next: general_systems_principle signal for scaling/concurrency lessons.
- **successor**: F-SOUL1 Phase 4 (3.0x target). PHIL-5 decomposition (5a+5b). L-601 sub-principle refactoring.

## S508b session note (DOMEX bundle: concept-inv falsification + NK Simpson's paradox + orient display fix)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: falsification (concept-inventor DOMEX-INV-S508) + exploration (nk-complexity DOMEX-NK-S508) + tooler (orient_analysis.py fix)
- **expect**: prerequisite-shadow >=20pp DECAYED difference. DOMEX citation density 1.5-2x. Orient science quality displays correctly.
- **actual**: (1) DOMEX-INV-S508 MERGED: prerequisite-shadow FALSIFIED (1.1pp vs 20pp). Citation density is the protective factor, not citation validity. 3/24 concepts falsified (12.5%). L-1361. (2) DOMEX-NK-S508 MERGED: Simpson's paradox — raw 2.38x DOMEX advantage reverses to 0.90x era-controlled. Convention establishment confound. L-1357. (3) orient_analysis.py science quality display fixed: cached artifact schema mismatch showed 0% when actual was 48%. Same bug in bayes-meta display (read results.ece vs top-level ece). Both fixed. L-1358. (4) Lanes compacted (69 archivable rows). (5) Science quality artifact refreshed (S508).
- **diff**: Both DOMEX predictions wrong — productive falsifications. Orient display was silently broken for 2+ sessions.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/orient_analysis.py` — _cached_artifact assumes consistent JSON schema between periodic artifacts and --json output. 2/7 artifact types had schema mismatches (science-quality, bayes-meta). Root cause: periodic measurement artifacts wrap data under `actual` key per EAD convention, but orient reads top-level keys per tool output convention. Fixed case-by-case; structural fix would be standardized accessor.
- **successor**: (1) F-INV1 S510 structural concept interim check. (2) Enforcement audit wiring (Sharpe>=9 prescriptions). (3) PHIL-16 ossification — dogma score 1.7, highest. (4) Science quality: significance testing still 9.6% (lowest criterion).

## S508a session note (PHIL-23 cascade falsification + dogma_finder improvement)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: falsification (evaluation — DOMEX-PHIL23-S508)
- **expect**: PHIL-23 claims all filter failures propagate downstream. Expect ≥5 incidents of containment.
- **actual**: PHIL-23 PARTIALLY FALSIFIED. Found 8 incident classes (n≥12 events) where failures were CONTAINED at structural gates. DROP criterion MET (n=8 ≥ n≥5). Key evidence: L-1038 (pre-commit gate), L-602 (claim.py), L-1204 (same-session fix), L-1018 (cascade_monitor). Counter: C4 (L-1007) silent 240 sessions ungated. Model: Reason's Swiss Cheese (1990). L-1359 written. First-ever challenge against PHIL-23 (0 in 508 sessions). PHIL-23 prose revised.
- **diff**: Expected ≥5, found 8. Containment conditions clearer than expected: structural gates are the mechanism, not random recovery. External theory (Swiss Cheese) maps precisely.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dogma_finder.py` — UNCHALLENGED PHIL claims had flat 0.7 score regardless of age. PHIL-23 unchallenged 508 sessions scored same as 50-session claim. Fixed: age-scaled scoring (0.7 base, up to 1.0 at 300+ sessions). This explains why PHIL-23 sat at #4 despite being the ONLY unchallenged philosophy claim — axioms with CONFIRM-ONLY scored higher because they had more signal types.
- **successor**: (1) Verify dogma_finder age-scaling surfaces long-unchallenged items properly. (2) PHIL-23 gating audit: which of the 14 filters (L-1005) are gated vs ungated? Priority: gate ungated layers. (3) Enforcement audit due. (4) Wire human_benefit_ratio into dispatch.
