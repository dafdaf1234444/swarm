Updated: 2026-02-27 S150

## What just happened
S150: setup-hygiene follow-through: `check_uncommitted()` now ignores transient Temp `tmp*/parent-child` untracked artifacts, and runtime rechecks (`bash -lc "python3 tools/maintenance.py --quick"`, `bash tools/check.sh --quick`) are NOTICE-only with actionable untracked files.
S149: periodic health-check refreshed in `memory/HEALTH.md` (score 4.5/5; compactness stays WATCH on dirty-tree proxy-K volatility), and `tools/periodics.json` health-check marker advanced to S149.
S149: maintenance setup-hygiene cleanup: `check_periodics()` now prefixes alerts with periodic IDs (for example `[fundamental-setup-reswarm]`), reducing friction when mapping maintenance output back to `tools/periodics.json`.
S149: setup-hygiene periodic executed: `check_session_log_integrity()` now treats backfilled already-seen session IDs in the recent tail as benign (no persistent false non-monotonic alert). `tools/periodics.json` marker `fundamental-setup-reswarm` advanced to S149.
S148: P-155 live-trace follow-through executed: added `tools/p155_live_trace.py` and generated `experiments/colonies/p155-live-trace-s147.json` (software-agent trace tournament, n=80/context). Competitive incentives increased deceptor share by +18.6pp (1.1% -> 19.6%) and reduced group accuracy by -24.4pp (90.8% -> 66.3%) versus cooperative incentives.
S147: maintenance signal refinement: `check_session_log_integrity()` now ignores expected repeated session IDs and only flags actionable drift (exact duplicate rows or recent non-monotonic tail order). Also synced state counts to tracked lessons (`207`), removing stale `+1 draft` wording.
S148: principles-dedup periodic executed: merged P-131 into P-130 in `memory/PRINCIPLES.md` (agent visibility now includes collapsing untasked experiment batches into variant pools). Active principles 150→149; `tools/periodics.json` marker `principles-dedup` advanced to S148.
S146: maintenance signal cleanup: `check_cross_references()` now emits one concise notice for untracked lesson drafts (instead of two redundant lines), reducing startup noise while preserving lesson-drift visibility.
S145: claim-vs-evidence periodic audit executed: PHIL challenge outcomes are 3 CONFIRMED / 6 REFINED / 2 SUPERSEDED / 1 PARTIAL (12 total, confirmed-only ratio 25%), so no P-164 underchallenging signal (>80%) and no new contradictions requiring challenge rows.
S145: HUMAN-QUEUE cleanup: HQ-9 closed from explicit repeated continuation signal (`swarm` after pause prompts). Default operating rule reaffirmed: integrate on live concurrent edits unless human explicitly requests freeze/pause.
S144: P-155 promotion pass: added `memory/lessons/L-207.md` from controlled incentive simulation (`experiments/colonies/p155-trace-deception-s144.json`), advanced P-155 to PARTIALLY OBSERVED in `memory/PRINCIPLES.md`, synced `docs/PAPER.md`, and refreshed periodic maintenance state (HEALTH + cross-variant markers).
S143: P-128 promotion pass: status advanced from THEORIZED to PARTIALLY OBSERVED in `memory/PRINCIPLES.md` using existing L-124 evidence (n=22 across 2 projects, limited-sample caveat kept). `docs/PAPER.md` unresolved section synced to avoid principle-status drift.
S142: maintenance usability pass: `check_uncommitted()` now includes short path samples for tracked/untracked notices, turning dirty-tree noise into immediately actionable file-level context during swarm startup.
S141: Swarm runtime verification pass executed from Codex (`python tools/maintenance.py`, `python tools/maintenance.py --inventory`, `bash tools/check.sh`): validator PASS, no DUE/PERIODIC debt, maintenance remains NOTICE-only due to dirty-tree state.
S140: setup-hygiene periodic executed: `tools/maintenance.py` `check_runtime_portability()` now validates bridge integrity by ensuring each bridge file explicitly references `SWARM.md` (not just file existence). `tools/periodics.json` `fundamental-setup-reswarm` marker advanced to S140.
S139: setup-hygiene maintenance hardening: added a periodics/session consistency guard in `tools/maintenance.py` (`check_periodics` now flags markers ahead of `SESSION-LOG`). State headers synced to latest session for `NEXT`/`INDEX`/`FRONTIER`.
S138: periodic health check refreshed in `memory/HEALTH.md` (score 4.5/5) and `tools/periodics.json` health-check marker advanced to S138. State header drift corrected by syncing `memory/INDEX.md` and `tasks/FRONTIER.md` session anchors to latest log.
S137: principles-dedup periodic executed: reduced overlap between P-109 and P-134 in `memory/PRINCIPLES.md` by separating roles (P-109 = duplication-rate signal; P-134 = dark-matter composition + cleanup prioritization). `tools/periodics.json` `principles-dedup` marker advanced to S137.
S136: F115 periodic paper re-swarm executed: `docs/PAPER.md` advanced to v0.6 with scale/session anchors refreshed to current state (S135 counts and timeline window), and `tools/periodics.json` `paper-reswarm` marker advanced S130→S135.
S135: Swarm runtime verification pass completed from Codex: `python tools/maintenance.py`, `python tools/maintenance.py --inventory`, and `bash tools/check.sh`. Belief validator PASS and maintenance remains NOTICE-only (no DUE/PERIODIC blockers); priorities unchanged.
S134: F105 proxy-K baseline fix: `tools/maintenance.py` `check_proxy_k_drift()` now builds schema-compatible baselines from all matching snapshots (preferring clean matches), instead of filtering only within preselected clean-history entries. This removes false `schema baseline unavailable (0 matching snapshots)` notices when valid schema-tagged dirty snapshots exist. Maintenance now returns NOTICE-only operational noise.
S133: HUMAN-QUEUE cleanup: closed HQ-8 using explicit human continuation signal (`swarm` => continue on concurrent edits) and re-scoped HQ-5 out of human-only queue (execution task, not human decision). Maintenance now shows no open HUMAN-QUEUE items and remains NOTICE-only.
S132: tool-consolidation follow-through: extracted shared parser helpers to new `tools/swarm_parse.py` (`active_principle_ids`, `active_frontier_ids`, `archived_frontier_ids`) and rewired both `tools/maintenance.py` + `tools/paper_drift.py` to use the shared module. Proxy-K T4 accounting now explicitly includes `swarm_parse.py` to avoid blind spots; periodic marker `tool-consolidation` advanced to S132.
S131: F105 cleanup pass applied on tooling surface: compressed `tools/maintenance.py`/`tools/paper_drift.py`/`tools/validate_beliefs.py`, simplified maintenance signal text, and refreshed proxy-K log via `python tools/proxy_k.py --save`. Result: maintenance and `bash tools/check.sh` now return NOTICE-only in this runtime (no DUE/PERIODIC blockers).
S130: F115 sentinel extended in `tools/paper_drift.py` to monitor explicit paper challenge-ratio claims (`X/Y challenges confirmed`) against live `beliefs/PHILOSOPHY.md` challenge-table stats. Also hardened `check_proxy_k_drift` in `tools/maintenance.py` to downgrade stale logged drift to NOTICE when dirty-tree live drift is already within threshold, removing a false-blocking DUE path.
S129: tool-consolidation periodic marker synced (`tools/periodics.json` S102→S128), and maintenance recheck now returns NOTICE-only (no DUE/PERIODIC). Handoff focus shifts from periodic debt to live-drift stabilization and pending principle/deploy work.
S128: setup-hygiene + cross-variant periodic pass: restored missing `tools/paper_drift.py` module so `tools/maintenance.py` executes again, tuned Proxy-K drift logic to downgrade dirty-session logged spikes to NOTICE, and reviewed cross-variant state (no active bulletin queue/new integration activity this cycle). `tools/periodics.json` marker `cross-variant-harvest` advanced S110→S128.
S127: Fundamental setup re-swarm periodic executed: fixed Windows console Unicode crash path in `tools/evolve.py` by configuring stdout/stderr encoding errors to `replace` at startup. Verified usage/help and compare path (`python tools/evolve.py`, `python tools/evolve.py compare belief-minimal belief-control`) run without `UnicodeEncodeError`. Updated `tools/periodics.json` marker `fundamental-setup-reswarm` S117→S126.
S126: periodic health check refreshed in `memory/HEALTH.md` (score 4.5/5): compactness moved to WATCH due to dirty-tree live proxy-K drift (+8.8% vs floor), while all other indicators stayed HEALTHY. `tools/periodics.json` health-check marker advanced to S126.
S125b: claim-vs-evidence periodic refreshed: PHIL-5 stale embedded challenge ratio (`6/7`) removed from identity prose and replaced with directional wording; PHIL challenge table appended with `REFINED S125`; `tools/periodics.json` claim-vs-evidence marker advanced S123→S125.
S125: principles-dedup periodic executed: merged overlapping NK-composite guidance by absorbing P-038 into P-042 (`memory/PRINCIPLES.md`). Active principles 151→150; `tools/periodics.json` `principles-dedup` marker advanced to S125. Synced `memory/INDEX.md` counts and paper scale statement to clear maintenance drift notices.
S124: principles-dedup periodic executed: overlap review tightened boundary between P-146 and P-147 in `memory/PRINCIPLES.md` (P-146 = cold-start bootstrap completeness; P-147 = cadence ownership/update responsibility in `tools/periodics.json`). No principle-count change; `tools/periodics.json` marker advanced S110→S124.
S123: README user-level operating pattern clarified: Codex is actively running sessions; user workflow is mainly frequent `swarm` triggering, history-based inspection, exploratory token burn, and selective heavy steering around key objectives.
S122: F105 compaction pass executed from maintenance DUE signal (proxy-K drift 8.8%). Compressed high-growth narrative files (`memory/INDEX.md`, `tasks/FRONTIER.md`) plus `SWARM.md` wording density. Drift dropped to 5.8% mid-pass, then rebounded during concurrent dirty-tree growth (observed up to 7.6%); maintenance reports this as live-drift NOTICE (`save when stable`) rather than DUE.
S121: F115 sentinel extension implemented in `tools/maintenance.py`: `check_paper_accuracy()` now validates explicit paper principle-status claims (`P-xxx OBSERVED/THEORIZED/PARTIALLY OBSERVED/...`, including grouped claims like `P-128 and P-155`) against statuses in `memory/PRINCIPLES.md`. Baseline check is quiet; synthetic probes confirm drift detection.
S119: F115 sentinel calibration refinement: `check_paper_accuracy()` contradiction alerts were deduplicated so one ID emits one primary DUE signal (for example archived-open or resolved-still-active) instead of duplicate cascades. Synthetic rechecks confirmed cleaner output with preserved detection.
S118: F115 extension implemented in `tools/maintenance.py`: `check_paper_accuracy()` now checks frontier-claim consistency in `docs/PAPER.md` by validating explicit `Fxxx RESOLVED` claims against `tasks/FRONTIER-ARCHIVE.md` and explicit `open question ... Fxxx` claims against active `tasks/FRONTIER.md`. Live parse confirms expected IDs (`resolved=[F92,F118]`, `open=[F114]`) with no new maintenance noise. Periodic health check also refreshed (`memory/HEALTH.md`), and `tools/periodics.json` health-check marker advanced to S118.
S117: F115 calibration pass completed for `check_paper_accuracy()` using synthetic dry-run scenarios (no real paper edits): clean state emits no alert; age==cadence emits DUE; age==2x cadence emits URGENT; scale mismatch emits NOTICE with field-level diffs. Thresholds kept unchanged.
S116: F115 follow-through implemented in `tools/maintenance.py`: new `check_paper_accuracy()` enforces living-paper drift checks (paper-version age vs cadence + parseable scale-statement consistency against live lessons/principles/beliefs/frontier counts). Maintenance now surfaces paper drift automatically instead of relying only on manual re-swarms.
S115: Maintenance stabilization: refreshed proxy-K measurement (`python tools/proxy_k.py --save`) to clear false URGENT drift from stale log head; current total 24,598 (+2.9% vs floor 23,916). Updated `tools/periodics.json` proxy-k marker to S115. Maintenance now NOTICE-only.
S114: F115 accuracy pass completed on `docs/PAPER.md` (v0.3): stale S94-era claims/counters updated to S113 state, F92/F118 moved from pending to resolved evidence, and unresolved set narrowed to PHIL-8 + P-128/P-155 + cross-session initiation gap.
S113: F92 RESOLVED and archived with conditional rule (workload topology + coordination primitive): independent fanout tasks peak near fanout (N=3 for 3-task wiki benchmark), lock-heavy cooperative RMW peaks near N=2 (S110/S111), append-only cooperative shared-file path scales to N~4 (S112). FRONTIER active 14→13.
S112: F92 primitive split benchmark completed (raw: experiments/spawn-quality/f92-real-cooperative-benchmark-s112.json): real shared-file append-only bulletin workflow (`tools/bulletin.py write`) scales through N=4 (N=2 1.59x, N=3 1.79x, N=4 2.53x vs N=1; 0 failures). L-204 written; FRONTIER F92 refined from workload-level to primitive-level guidance.
S111: F92 real-task validation completed (raw: experiments/spawn-quality/f92-real-coop-benchmark-s111.json) using a swarm-style shared markdown update workflow: N=2 is best (1.02x vs N=1), while N=3 (0.96x) and N=4 (0.86x) regress. L-203 written; FRONTIER F92 refined with real cooperative evidence.
S110: F92 cooperative-case benchmark completed (raw: experiments/spawn-quality/f92-cooperative-benchmark-s110.json): shared-state SQLite workload peaks at N=2 (1.21x vs N=1), while N=3 (0.96x) and N=4 (0.91x) regress under lock contention. L-202 written; FRONTIER F92 refined to workload-topology sizing rule.
S109: F92 N=4 closeout benchmark completed (raw: experiments/spawn-quality/f92-n4-benchmark-s109.json): wiki 3-task workload peaked at N=3 (2.77x) and regressed at N=4 (2.69x); compute-heavy 4-task workload showed only +1.9% N=4 gain over N=3 (2.45x vs 2.40x) with lower efficiency. L-201 written; FRONTIER F92 refined.
S108: F92 controlled same-task benchmark completed (`wiki_swarm`, 3 topics): median speedups N=2 1.33x, N=3 2.75x vs N=1; supports N=3 default for independent 3-task workloads. L-200 written; FRONTIER F92 refined.
S107: F92 advanced with second colony-size data point from spawn-log: N=2 (SE-001) was suboptimal when partition skipped discovery (0 cross-agent-unique, 2.3x tool-call overhead); FRONTIER F92 updated to require controlled N=2/3/4 comparison.
S105: F118 RESOLVED and archived in FRONTIER-ARCHIVE (non-Claude execution criterion satisfied by Codex run evidence from S104).
S104: F118 non-Claude execution tested in Codex CLI on this repo; SWARM startup path and maintenance run validated (NOTICE-only, no DUE/URGENT).
S103: context_router.py re-embedded in INDEX.md cold-start path; PHIL-4/PHIL-8 bulletin resolved; principle count 152→151 fixed; stale bulletin deleted.
S102: Gap audit (L-197): PHIL-4 stale count + PHIL-8 equilibrium challenged, P-164 100% signal. Tool consolidation deeper pass (L-198): 28 tools, no dead tools, context_router.py = key lost-embedding (63 sessions unused).
S101: Claim-vs-evidence audit (L-195) + tool consolidation (L-196) complete. 22% non-embedded = within P-090 norm.
S100: T3 compression complete — PRINCIPLES.md −968t; proxy K 24,856→23,916 (2.3% above floor).

## For next session
1. **Proxy-K stabilization** — capture at least one clean (non-dirty-tree) snapshot with current schema (`python tools/proxy_k.py --save`) to strengthen compaction-floor reliability.
2. **P-155 follow-through (high-fidelity)** — run the same incentive contrast on real LLM/human-task traces (beyond software-agent simulation).
3. **F111 deploy decision** — workspace ready. Human review needed.
4. **Runtime portability cleanup** — this host has no runnable `python`/`py` launcher in PowerShell; either repair launcher mapping or keep startup checks on `bash tools/check.sh --quick` (`python3`) path.

## Key state
- Proxy K (live, dirty tree): NOTICE-level drift; save stable snapshot before compaction (`python tools/proxy_k.py --save`).
- 207L 149P 14B 13F. Validator PASS. Swarmability 100/100.
- F105 RESOLVED: compact.py wired. F76 RESOLVED. F71 RESOLVED. F101 Phase 2 DONE. F115 paper updated to v0.6.
- R6 harvest + all deferred items complete. Next cross-variant harvest due ~S159 (15-session cadence from S144 marker).
- 0 THEORIZED remain. 6 PARTIALLY OBSERVED (P-128/P-141/P-155/P-156/P-157/P-158).
