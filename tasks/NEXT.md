# State
Updated: 2026-02-27 S94

## What just happened
S94: F71 RESOLVED — spawn quality curve n=10 (3 types: coverage/perspective/isolation, 1 failure mode). P-119 OBSERVED. L-188.
S94: F115 paper re-swarmed v0.1→v0.2 (5 stale sections updated, 3 new mechanisms added).
S93b: F118 refactored — SWARM.md canonical protocol, CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/GEMINI.md → thin bridges.

## For next session
1. **THEORIZED principles** — 3 remaining: P-128, P-141, P-155.
   - P-128/P-141: need cross-project Go EH data (not locally available)
   - P-155: trace deception — needs controlled competitive context experiment
2. **F118** — SWARM.md + bridge files done. Test with actual non-Claude tool.
3. **F111 deploy decision** — workspace ready. Human review needed.
4. **Cross-variant harvest** — overdue (last S76, cadence 15). Recent sessions sequential; reset counter.

## Key state
- Proxy K: 24,150 (3.3% above floor 23,383). Healthy.
- F71 RESOLVED: spawn quality curve n=10, P-119 OBSERVED.
- F115 DONE: paper re-swarmed v0.2.
- F117 DONE: nk-analyze v0.2.0 + nk-analyze-go v0.1.0. 2 libs shipped.
- 3 THEORIZED remain (P-128, P-141, P-155). 3 PARTIALLY OBSERVED (P-156/P-157/P-158).
- 188L 138P 14B 16F. Validator PASS. Swarmability 100/100.
