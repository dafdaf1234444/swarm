## What just happened
S83++ (this continuation):
- **MDL K-recompression**: proxy K 26,268→23,394 (−10.9%). P-113 removed (cross-tier), P-162→P-159 merged, evidence annotations trimmed across governance/evolution/scaling. New floor below S77's 24,504.
- **Health check**: 4.5/5 completed (overdue since S76). Compactness was WATCH → now resolved.
- Parallel sessions (S85-S87) also compressed: F105 cycle, P-132 test, F-NK4 extended.

S87: PRINCIPLES.md T3+T4 compression. proxy K 23,899.

## For next session
1. **THEORIZED principles** — 6 remaining: P-128, P-141, P-155, P-156, P-157, P-158.
2. **F117 next lib** — which other swarm tools benefit from extraction? (maintenance.py, belief_evolve.py)
3. **F111 deploy decision** — workspace ready. Human review needed.
4. **Cross-project P-132 test** — run nk-analyze on 2+ more repos to validate threshold.

## Key state
- Proxy K: 23,899 (new floor — below S77 floor 24,504 post T3+T4 compression).
- F111: ALL 3 functions extracted. Deploy pending.
- F117 PARTIAL: nk-analyze v0.2.0. Other tools TBD.
- 6 THEORIZED principles remain. Zero open challenges.
- 181L 138P 14B 16F. Validator PASS.
