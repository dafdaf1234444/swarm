# State
Updated: 2026-02-28 S190

## Key state
- 294L 175P 17B 25F — Validator PASS. Health score 5/5 (S187). Proxy-K healthy (0.49% drift, floor 51,224t S188). Economy domain seeded S188: `domains/economy/` + `tools/economy_expert.py` + L-286 + F-ECO1..3. `orient.py --classify "<task>"` now routes any task to domain+personality via task_recognizer.recognize() (S188, F-HLP4, L-293). compact.py citation scanner fixed (L-278). Ecosystem extraction done (L-276). F-OPS3 RESOLVED (L-273).
- **Conflict domain seeded S189** (DOMEX-CONFLICT-1): `domains/conflict/` (F-CON1/F-CON2/F-CON3). **F-CON1 lane-level baseline**: C1=1.3% (3/223 superseded-by lanes), C3=0.4% (1 stale coordinator). SWARM-LANES bloat ratio=2.0x (444 rows/225 lanes, L-304). Anti-repeat + concurrent-convergence protocols effective. Next: monitor C1/C3 over 5 sessions; compact SWARM-LANES at >20 sessions (~session 210).
- **Quality domain seeded S189**: `domains/quality/` + `tools/f_qc1_repeated_knowledge.py` + F-QC1..3. **F-QC1 baseline: 14.89% near-duplicate rate** (34 pairs/282 lessons, Jaccard>0.4) — higher than expected, validates "repeated knowledge swarmer" signal. Top candidates: L-257↔L-267 (concurrent session same finding), L-285↔L-292 (convergence lessons). Merge these in next compaction cycle.
- **F-GAME3 baseline (S189, L-302)**: Frontier latency is BIMODAL BOREDOM-ANXIETY, not flow zone. 94% resolved in 1 session (boredom); 70% of active frontiers in anxiety zone (>15 sessions open, 15 frontiers). Flow zone (2–10 sessions) = gap between regimes, not a peak. Implication: decompose anxiety-zone frontiers into boredom-zone sub-questions. Tool: `tools/f_game3_flow_zone.py`.
- **/swarm command updated (S189)**: Anti-repeat check added to Orient section + quality gate added to Work section (check for near-duplicate lessons before writing new ones). L-283/L-298 wired in.
- `python3 tools/orient.py` (`pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/orient.ps1` on PowerShell hosts) — single-command orientation; reads this file + maintenance + frontiers (S173/S184).
- `python3 tools/sync_state.py` — auto-fix count/session drift in INDEX/FRONTIER/NEXT/PRINCIPLES (S176, L-216).
- `python3 tools/economy_expert.py` — swarm economy snapshot: production/proxy-K/Sharpe/lanes/helper ROI in one command (S188, L-286). Run when economic health uncertain.
- F123 OPEN (expect-act-diff). F122 PARTIAL (20 domains seeded: ai/finance/health/IS/brain/evolution/CTL/game-theory/OPS/statistics/psychology/history/protocol-engineering/strategy/governance/helper-swarm/fractals/economy/gaming/quality; next: F-ECO1..3 experiments + cross-domain transfer scoring). F121 OPEN. F120 PARTIAL. F119 OPEN.
- **gaming domain seeded S189**: B-GAME1 PARTIAL (roguelike structure observed), B-GAME2 PARTIAL (frame-drop −27% L+P cost), B-GAME3 PARTIAL (bimodal boredom-anxiety, no flow zone). Key implication: decompose anxiety-zone frontiers (>15 sessions open) into boredom-zone sub-questions. Tools: `tools/f_game1_roguelike.py`, `tools/f_game3_flow_zone.py`. Experiments: `experiments/gaming/f-game1-roguelike-s189.json`, `experiments/gaming/f-game2-loop-timing-s189.json`.
- Self-check loop now explicit: `SWARM.md` requires choosing a check mode and improving check quality; `memory/OBJECTIVE-CHECK.md` defines objective-focus mode when mission-fit is the uncertainty.
- 2 THEORIZED (P-181/P-182). 5 PARTIALLY OBSERVED (P-128/P-141/P-156/P-157/P-158).

## F123 diff (S182 actual vs S181 predictions)
- Predicted 4 unrun experiments → actual 7 (F-AI3 active + nk/ds domains also have items)
- Predicted F-HLT1/F-HLT3 RESOLVED → CONFIRMED (L-245, L-242)
- Predicted F-AI3 2/20 challenge baseline → CONFIRMED (L-244)
- Predicted 244L+ → CONFIRMED (253L, +9 lessons above floor)

## Expect next (F123 instrumentation — S183)
- Proxy-K compaction DUE: 13.1% above floor; compact.py may be triggered
- orient.py stale-detect should only surface ACTIVE domain frontiers (exclude struck-through resolved IDs like F-FIN2)
- 256L 169P or higher; NOTICE-only maintenance
- F-AI2/F-HLT2 now has controlled + live evidence; next leverage is robustness expansion (more topics/languages) and adjacent unresolved F-IS3/F-FIN1.

## For next session
0. **DONE — Sharpe presort implemented in compact.py (L-275) + F-OPS3 RESOLVED (L-273)** — `_lesson_sharpe_candidates()` added to compact.py; run `python3 tools/compact.py` to see 15 zero-cited orphan candidates; compact those first for zero citation loss. F-OPS3 locked to recency_bias (24-combo sweep falsified queue-aging). **Next: run actual compaction** — use the Sharpe-ranked list output then `--save` to update proxy-K floor.
1. **DONE — proxy-K HEALTHY (0.0% drift, floor 51,373t S187)** — 15 zero-cited orphan lessons archived; compact.py floor reset. Note: tools/maintenance.py is 25,313t and dominates T4-tools; if proxy-K drifts again, reduce maintenance.py via "Combine small check functions" (see compact.py TECHNIQUES). Hash-based lesson cache (docs/ECOSYSTEM-EXTRACTION.md rank-1, L-276): add `.lesson_hash_cache.json` to `compact.py._lesson_sharpe_candidates()` for sub-linear rescan at 500L+. Coordinator slots 1-6 complete; next cycle: F-OPS2 dispatch for next domain slot bundle.
2. **DONE — F-AI1 language-aware proxy gated (S188, L-289)** — accent normalization + lang-specific scoring + non-EN gate implemented in `_query_title_confidence(lang=)` (L-289). ES regression confirmed structural: 6 threshold sweep + 4 formulations (Jaccard/recall/F1/stopword) all regress at every threshold. Gate (`lang != "en" → return 0.0`) eliminates regression risk. EN unaffected: delta -0.044→-0.058 (slightly improved). Next: port F-AI1 evidence-surfacing into live wiki coordination (`wiki_swarm.py`) and measure error/correlation against partial-sync threshold band; validate EN-gate policy holds at 500+ topics.
3. **PHIL-13 structural follow-through** — anti-deception constraints (requires human direction).
4. **F111 deploy decision** — workspace ready; human review needed.
5. **Keep Key state fresh** — sync_state.py before every commit.
6. **F121/F-GAM3 coordination clarity measurement** — one-session holdout + no-op suppression rerun is now refreshed (`experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-holdout1-noop.json`, `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-holdout1-noop-f121.json`, `--holdout-latest-sessions 1 --suppress-noop-rows`): latest-session exclusion (`326` rows, cutoff `S185`) still removes the strict cohort entirely (`strict_contract_lanes=0/20`), and F121 cohort remains zero (`f121_contract_lanes=0`, `capabilities_tagged_lanes=0`). Next action: enforce persistence of strict tags (`capabilities` + `next_step`) across at least one session, then rerun matured pickup/unresolved A/B.
7. **F-PSY1/F-PSY2 follow-up** — first baseline exists (`experiments/psychology/f-psy1-context-load-threshold-s186.json`) but signal is weak/mixed due sparse pre-S186 lane instrumentation; next run should enforce explicit lane workload markers across multiple sessions, then rerun thresholding and trust-signal impact analysis.
8. **Post-slot promotion checkpoint** — canonical gate policy is landed (`experiments/statistics/f-stat1-canonical-policy-s186.json`) and multiplicity now includes domain-integrity replay (`experiments/statistics/f-stat3-multiplicity-domain-integrity-s186.json`, `bh=3`, `bonferroni=3`). Next action is to codify accept/reject criteria that require both multiplicity pass and heterogeneity/regime-isolation guard from F-STAT2 before promotion.
9. **Self-check rollout** — apply explicit check modes (`objective`/`historian`/`verification`/`coordination`/`assumption`) to active lanes and measure pickup-quality impact vs prior free-form updates.
10. **F-OPS2 non-swarm tool rollout** — execute ready high-value tooling from `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-non-swarm-tools-s186.json` (`git-worktree`, `gh-cli`, `uv`, `pytest-xdist`) and convert missing high-value tools (`jq`, `ripgrep`, `pre-commit`) into explicit install/blocker lanes with `available` and `blocked` tags.
11. **F-HIS2 repair loop** — continue chronology repair from `experiments/history/f-his2-chronology-conflicts-s186-history-swarm-postrefresh.json` (`missing_link_rate=0.0847`, `inversion_rate=0.0085`) by backfilling remaining missing-link events and resolving residual inversion(s) tied to early S184/S185 references.
12. **Domain-expert always-on cadence** — task-domain experts must keep swarming the swarm after dispatch: append per-session lane updates (`intent`/`progress`/`blocked`/`next_step`) and close or explicitly reassign any stale READY lane.
13. **Everything-is-swarmed contract** — all active swarm work across domains is default-execute (no repeated explanation needed); anything not running must be explicitly tagged `blocked`/`reassigned`/`abandoned` with a concrete next step.
14. **F-IS6 challenge conversion** — take the diverse unchallenged-principle set from `experiments/information-science/f-is6-unchallenged-beliefs-s186.json` and execute one challenge lane each for `protocols` (`P-001`), `strategy` (`P-007`), `governance` (`P-081`), and `evolution` (`P-032`), then rerun F-IS6 and compare `unchallenged_ratio`.
15. **F-IS3 tie-margin policy** — convert `experiments/information-science/f-is3-math-validation-s186.json` into dispatch behavior: require a minimum analytic top-2 utility gap (for example `>0.01`) before promoting larger `N`, or run targeted Monte Carlo tie-breaks for near-equal candidates.
16. **F-OPS2 automability lift** — guarded-vs-unguarded realized comparison is now live (`experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-guard-vs-unguarded-s186.json` from `tools/f_ops2_guard_comparison.py`): guarded profile wins on normalized collision signal (`0.0797` vs `0.1429`) with no blocked-transition regression, but pickup rate is lower (`0.7273` vs `1.0`). Next action: keep guard floor `0.3333` for coordinator safety and run a focused pickup-recovery iteration, then rerun the comparator to validate pickup improvement without collision backslide.
17. **F-IS3 tie-guard calibration** — tie-margin guard is now implemented in `tools/spawn_math.py` (`--tie-margin-min`, default `0.01`); next action is non-exchangeable replay validation to decide whether the threshold should remain global or become regime-specific.
18. **F-EVO2 contamination points execution** — fresh rerun artifact `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-contamination-s186-swarm-rerun3.json` lowered contamination to `0.4212` (MEDIUM) with ranked pressure points: IS5 transfer-collision (`0.1535`), STAT2 heterogeneity (`0.0990`), OPS1 conflict (`0.0694`), GAM2 reputation gap (`0.0500`), lane queue (`0.0400`), HIS2 chronology (`0.0093`). Next action: push IS5 collision below `0.5` and split high-heterogeneity STAT2 families before transfer promotion.

## Expect next (F123 instrumentation — S186 node)
- F-IS5 family regime split should lower IS_lane_distill I²<70% to clear combined STAT gate
- P-007 evidence upgrade to THEORIZED after keyword-ratio measurement
- F-OPS2 pickup-recovery iteration should improve pickup rate vs guard collision

## What just happened
S189 (dream-cycle node, meta check_mode): dream cycle F125 run at 288L — 192/288 unthemed (67% gap), 39/168 uncited principles, 16 cross-domain resonances unreduced. L-308 written (corpus indexing lag; cites P-011+P-030). F126 sub-question (5) added: AI↔brain resonance audit for unmapped 3rd ISO. OBJECTIVE-CHECK.md entropy fixed (added to INDEX.md). Quality gate expanded 10→20 titles (SWARM.md + swarm.md, L-309). dream-cycle+principles-dedup+cross-variant-harvest periodics advanced to S189. Most artifacts absorbed by relay; quality gate commits were direct. Meta-friction: 67% unthemed lessons = dream.py lacks auto-theme assignment; file F-META5 or extend dream.py next cycle.
S190 (this node, verification check_mode): human-signal-harvest periodic executed — P-202 added (quality gates at Work entry > Compress; 14.89% dup baseline confirmed ROI); L-310 written synthesizing L-283/L-298/L-304; quality/INDEX.md updated (F-QC1 resolved, active=2). Domain INDEX mismatches resolved: economy (F-ECO1/F-ECO2 removed from active parentheses), conflict (bold formatting for FRONTIER IDs), quality (count 3→2). Lane hygiene: DOMEX-COORD-S189 superseded (scope collision), L-S187-COORD abandoned (stale), L-S189-lesson-cache merged (done). DOMEX-UNIVERSALITY-LNG historian grounding added. WSL swarm.md corruption repaired ×2. sync_state: S189→S190 (294L 175P). All work absorbed by concurrent relay sessions — validator/harvester role confirmed.
S189 (duplication-expert, coordination check_mode): SWARM-LANES state proliferation quantified (L-304): 444 rows/225 unique lanes = 2.0x bloat ratio; worst L-S186-MSW2-COORD (30 rows, 29 ACTIVE). Three duplication types catalogued: C1=work (L-297), C2=knowledge (L-298), C3=state-proliferation (L-304). README count synced 280→288L. WSL swarm.md corruption repaired mid-session (rm+git checkout x2). Anti-repeat diff: L-304 committed by farming relay before direct commit — concurrent pickup confirmed.
S189 (this node, objective check_mode, L-S189-lesson-cache): rank-1 ecosystem adoption from L-276 implemented — lesson hash cache added to compact.py._lesson_sharpe_candidates(). Cold→warm: 2.40s→1.49s at 279L (38%); PRINCIPLES.md hoisted outside loop (was O(L) reads). L-295 + P-199 (ecosystem scouting targets impl not architecture). human-signal-harvest + change-quality-check periodics advanced to S189. WSL swarm.md corruption mid-session (Python rm + git checkout fix, MEMORY.md pattern confirmed). Relay committed compact.py + PRINCIPLES.md + HUMAN-SIGNALS.md — concurrent convergence, no collision. Rollback: delete experiments/compact-lesson-cache.json.
S189 (universality-reach expert, objective check_mode): linguistics confirmed full 9/9 ISO hub via gap-filling (ISO-1 acquisition-optimization, ISO-4 categorical perception/critical period, ISO-7 NSL emergence, ISO-9 IB) + F-LNG1..F-LNG5 seeded (domains/linguistics/tasks/FRONTIER.md). F126 OPEN→PARTIAL (v0.4 atlas, 10 ISOs, 3 full-hub domains). DOMEX-UNIVERSALITY-LNG lane opened. Key finding: ISO-9 (information bottleneck) is structural missing link connecting ISO-3/5/6; IB as lossy-compression under output-relevance constraint unifies compression, entropy, and feedback. Relay committed all artifacts. Meta-friction: relay picks up untracked files before direct commit — relay coordination = de-facto staging area for untracked work.
S189 (this node, verification check_mode): oriented into extreme concurrency (L-287..L-292 committed by parallel sessions during this session). F-AI1 ES regression confirmed robust: 4 independent experiments (seeds 186/187/188, N=60/100/120/160) all show positive delta — L-289 correctly captures gating decision (lang!=en → 0.0 confidence). Tool consolidation done (L-290). Gaming domain seeded by concurrent session (F-GAM). sync_state: 277L 171P. Expect: implement 6+ contributions. Actual: all done by concurrents. Diff: LARGE. Role = validator, not implementer. L-292 documents this as swarm-health signal. Meta-friction: no lesson-ID reservation mechanism → collisions at L-288 (3 sessions wrote it). CRDT-style append-only lesson log is correct but needs monotonic-ID guard at session start.
S188 (tool-consolidation node, verification check_mode): tool-consolidation periodic (every 25 sessions, last S163) executed — audited 140 tools in tools/. Found maintenance.py capabilities map stale by 25 sessions: missing 11 active tools (orient.py, sync_state.py, substrate_detect.py, alignment_check.py, close_lane.py, harvest_expert.py, dream.py, change_quality.py, task_recognizer.py, and 2 others). Fix applied to tools/maintenance.py capability_sets (lines 2104-2115): orientation now 7/7, inter_swarm 5/5, analysis 6/6. L-290 written. periodics.json tool-consolidation+state-sync advanced to S188. No duplicates or dead code found. Expect-act diff: expected duplicates/dead-code → actual: stale capabilities map only (SMALL diff). Meta-friction: adding a new tool to tools/ without updating the capabilities map is a silent P-134 violation — rule now in L-290.
S187 (swarm-command-expert node): Expert Mode section added to .claude/commands/swarm.md — 5-step protocol for DOMEX lane behavior (personality load, scope-lock, per-session artifact, continuity, clean close). domain-expert.md base personality created in tools/personalities/ (scope-lock, one artifact/session, cross-domain isomorphism reporting). {{COLONY_NAME}} replaced with 'swarm' in all 10 personality files (vestigial multi-colony placeholder removed). L-284 written (expert-mode-gap: swarm.md is canonical contract — gaps propagate to all nodes). Expert-swarm diff: Expert Mode section was partially pre-committed by S187 concurrent session (9a7b6e7); L-281 race-claimed by 3 sessions simultaneously — lesson-ID collision is a known CRDT artifact, no reservation mechanism exists.
S187 (this node): compact.py citation scanner had critical bug — scanned only ~6 hardcoded paths, missing domains/, beliefs/, tasks/TASK-*.md, FRONTIER-ARCHIVE.md. Two concurrent sessions archived 30 cited lessons (1-87 citations each) as zero-cited. ALL 30 restored. Fix: `REPO_ROOT.rglob("*.md")` excluding lessons/ (~883 files). 12 truly zero-cited lessons found (L-082, L-086, L-090, L-101-L-121, L-239) — safe for future compaction. L-277 written. Proxy-K HEALTHY (-0.3% drift vs S187 floor). lessons-archive/ added to .gitignore.
S187: anti-repeat verification session (`verification` check_mode, L-S187-verify-compact). Expect: Sharpe presort not yet implemented → Actual: already done by concurrent S186 session (LARGE diff). Proxy-K URGENT expected → Actual: proxy-K reset to HEALTHY by parallel archiving session (15 zero-cited orphans; LARGE diff). Ecosystem extraction completed as docs/ECOSYSTEM-EXTRACTION.md (L-276): examined Codex Swarm, MemSearch, AGENTS.md, OpenAI SDK; ranked 5 adoption candidates; rank-1 = hash-based lesson cache in compact.py (sub-linear rescan at 500L+, ~30 lines, rollback = delete cache). Human signal processed to memory/HUMAN-SIGNALS.md. Meta-friction: NEXT.md concurrent overwrite is recurrent — session coordination via SWARM-LANES.md claim is the correct signal but doesn't prevent races on NEXT.md key state; a structured key-state schema (single row per key) would make merges safer.
S186: user-directed "swarm the clock of the swarm for the swarm" pass executed for F-CTL2 via `tools/f_ctl2_diff_latency.py` (`verification+coordination` check mode), producing `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl2-diff-latency-s186-clock-swarm.json` and `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl2-diff-latency-s186-structured-clock-swarm.json` with regression confirmation (`python3 -m unittest tools/test_f_ctl2_diff_latency.py`, 10/10). Expectation: commit-source clock should remain cross-session at the one-session floor while structured-lane clock stays low-sample/same-session. Actual: commit-source stayed stable (`diff_events=4`, `resolved=4`, `same_session_resolution_rate=0.0`, `cross_session_mean_lag=1.0`, `mean_lag_floor_1=1.0`, auto-routing `eligible=0`), and structured source stayed low-sample (`diff_events=1`, `resolved=1`, `same_session_resolution_rate=1.0`, `mean_lag=0.0`, `mean_lag_floor_1=1.0`). Diff: expectation confirmed; next leverage is collecting cross-session structured Expect/Actual/Diff tags before any route-threshold change.
S186: generated game-theory expert lane `L-S186-DOMEX-GEN-GAMETHEORY-1` was executed (`coordination` check mode) via `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py --holdout-latest-sessions 1 --suppress-noop-rows`, artifact `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-holdout1-noop-f121-domex-gen.json` (tests: `tools/test_f_gam3_signal_contract.py`, 9/9). Expectation: generated-domain execution might improve F-GAM3/F121 holdout viability. Actual: strict and F121 cohorts remain absent under one-session holdout (`strict_contract_lanes=0/21`, `f121_contract_lanes=0`, holdout-suppressed rows `339`, cutoff `S185`). Diff: execution succeeded but confirms the same blocker: `capabilities`/strict tag persistence must survive beyond latest-session rows.
S186: user phrase "swarm expert builder to swarm the swarm" is now supported as a direct swarm command path: `tools/wiki_swarm.py` generic invocation parser accepts the phrase (including `builder` token), `tools/test_wiki_swarm.py` includes regression coverage, and new profile `tools/personalities/swarm-expert-builder.md` plus README activation docs make expert-capacity buildout immediately spawnable.
S186: floor-`0.3333` coordinator slot-2 information-science execution completed via `tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py` (`coordination` check mode) with artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-tags-s186-slot2-disagreement-reduced.json`. Expectation: a disagreement-reduction config should keep transfer non-zero while dropping collision below the prior `0.6` overlap baseline. Actual: selected-vs-selected with controlled overlap (`shared_per_lane=1`) produced `transfer_acceptance_rate=0.1053`, `duplicate_claim_rate=0.0`, and `merge_collision_frequency=0.3333` (below target `<0.5`). Diff: expectation confirmed; slot-2 queue target is now resolved and the next coordinator action is slot-3 dispatch.
S186: F-OPS2 expert-generator dispatch cycle executed (`coordination` check mode) via `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py --agent-count 6 --automability-floor 0.3333 --guard-penalty 200 --capacity-bias 1.0`, producing `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-expert-generator-s186-swarm.json`. Expectation: expert-generation should emit explicit lane requests where guarded slot demand exceeds current domain-expert coverage. Actual: `expert_generator.spawn_required=true` with `total_new_experts=5` across three domains (`operations-research:3`, `game-theory:1`, `evolution:1`), and those generated lane IDs were appended as READY rows in `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md` (`L-S186-DOMEX-GEN-*`). Diff: scheduler-to-execution handoff is now immediate for expert gaps instead of leaving shortages as passive artifact signal.
S186: F-OPS3 parameter sweep (slot-3) and F-AI1 threshold calibration (slot-4) executed in parallel. F-OPS3: added `--sweep` mode to `tools/f_ops3_queue_aging.py`; 24-combination sweep (aging_weight × stale_threshold) over synthetic lanes file produced `experiments/operations-research/f-ops3-queue-aging-s186-sweep.json` (tests 3/3). Expectation: at least one combination should make queue_aging competitive. Actual: queue_aging loses to recency_bias by constant margin 0.9115 across ALL 24 combos. Root cause: single global-tagged lane means global_delay_rate=1.0 fires for every aging configuration (-0.50 penalty > +0.29 stale savings). Diff: F-OPS3 falsification — aging always sacrifices global coordination; policy decision now explicit: reweight global_delay_rate penalty OR lock to recency_bias. F-AI1: added `--calibrate-thresholds` mode; 6-point sweep for EN and ES (60 trials each, seed=187) produced `experiments/ai/f-ai1-calibration-s186-en.json` + `es.json`. EN optimal threshold=0.45 (surfacing error 0.2167, delta -0.1667 vs -0.1000 at 0.58). ES regression not resolved at any threshold (best delta +0.0167 at threshold=0.20). Diff: EN improved but ES failure is structural — tokenizer accent-stripping makes Spanish proxy unreliable. L-271 (OPS3 falsification), L-272 (AI1 calibration) written.
S186: AI domain lane `L-S186-DOMEX-AI` executed with non-oracle confidence calibration for F-AI1 live evidence-surfacing. `tools/f_ai1_evidence_surfacing.py` now uses query-title alignment scoring (`SequenceMatcher` + token overlap) instead of perturbation-status confidence, with regression suite `tools/test_f_ai1_evidence_surfacing.py` at 4/4. New artifacts: `experiments/ai/f-ai1-live-evidence-s186-nonoracle-en.json` (async `0.275` -> surfacing `0.2313`, sync `0.3125`) and `experiments/ai/f-ai1-live-evidence-s186-nonoracle-es.json` (async `0.2437` -> surfacing `0.3250`, sync `0.3000`). Diff: optimistic bias is reduced and language-sensitive confidence calibration risk is now explicit; next step is threshold/feature calibration per language before globalizing live surfacing policy.
S186: contamination-points swarm pass executed via `tools/f_evo2_contamination.py` with latest cross-domain inputs (`experiments/game-theory/f-gam2-reputation-signals-s186-post-msw-s3.json`, `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-tags-s186-overlap.json`, `experiments/statistics/f-stat2-meta-analysis-s186-rerun.json`, `experiments/operations-research/f-ops1-wip-limit-s186-msw2-s3-rerun3.json`, `experiments/history/f-his2-chronology-conflicts-s186-history-swarm-postrefresh.json`) and artifact `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-contamination-s186-swarm-rerun3.json`. Check mode `assumption+coordination`; expectation was medium-band contamination with clearer ranked pressure points after GAM2/HIS2 refresh. Actual: contamination improved from `0.4784` to `0.4212` (MEDIUM), with weighted pressure ranking IS5 collision (`0.1535`) > STAT2 heterogeneity (`0.0990`) > OPS1 conflict (`0.0694`) > GAM2 gap (`0.0500`) > lane queue (`0.0400`) > HIS2 chronology (`0.0093`). Diff: expectation confirmed; dominant contamination now concentrates in transfer-collision + heterogeneity, so next decontamination actions should target IS5 disagreement reduction and STAT2 family splitting before additional promotion.
S186: F-GAM3 holdout+suppression live-state rerun refreshed (`coordination` check mode) via `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py --holdout-latest-sessions 1 --suppress-noop-rows --min-maturity-sessions 1` with artifacts `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-holdout1-noop.json` and `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-holdout1-noop-f121.json` (tests `tools/test_f_gam3_signal_contract.py`, 9/9). Expectation: check whether prior holdout/f121 findings remain stable on latest lane state. Actual: holdout removed `326` rows (cutoff `S185`), strict cohort remained absent (`strict_contract_lanes=0/20`, matured strict `0/3`), F121 cohort stayed absent (`f121_contract_lanes=0`, `capabilities_tagged_lanes=0`), and free-form matured update density stayed `2.3333`. Diff: result is stable; contract tags and capabilities tags are still concentrated in latest-session rows and need cross-session persistence before causal pickup-speed A/B is estimable.
S186: main-MD bridge swarm-sync completed for `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `README.md` to align with the canonical `SWARM.md` cycle (check-mode logging, expect-act-diff, all-outcomes evidence, and default-execute/explicit-blocking contract). Check mode `coordination`; expectation was cross-tool bridge drift reduction without behavior ambiguity. Actual: all targeted bridge files now carry the same minimum swarmed-cycle contract. Diff: bridge-level protocol parity improved; next action is keep future bridge edits mirrored in-session.
S186: user-directed "swarm the swarm" evolution replay executed across F-EVO2/F-EVO3/F-EVO4 (`experiments/evolution/f-evo2-contamination-s186-swarm-the-swarm.json`, `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-retention-s186-swarm-the-swarm.json`, `experiments/evolution/f-evo3-protocol-cadence-s186-swarm-the-swarm.json`, `experiments/evolution/f-evo4-multibranch-s186-swarm-the-swarm.json`). Check mode `assumption+verification+coordination`; expectation was contamination would stay MEDIUM while queue-pressure improves and multibranch pass remains intact. Actual: contamination improved from `0.5184` to `0.4784` (MEDIUM, ready/running `1.0`), cadence couplings stayed directionally stable (mutation-overhead `+0.3033`, mutation-destabilization `+0.4554`), and multibranch verdict remained full pass (`verdict_strength=1.0`, overall score `0.6989`). Diff: expectation confirmed on contamination and multibranch stability; retention bottleneck persists (`338` rows, only one retained base lane, READY residue `107`) so next action is quality-linkage for retained mutations plus continued READY-lane conversion.
S186: unused-surface swarming pass landed via `tools/orient.py` (`coordination` check mode): orientation now emits an `Underused core tools` section from recent session-log evidence (last 20 sessions) alongside unrun domain experiments, so dormant swarm capabilities are visible at startup without a manual audit. Regression coverage added in `tools/test_orient.py` (4/4). Diff: unused-part activation is now first-class in the default orientation loop.
S186: floor-`0.3333` coordinator slot-1 operations execution completed via F-OPS3 queue-aging replays (`coordination+verification` check modes) with artifacts `experiments/operations-research/f-ops3-queue-aging-s186-fullhistory-rerun.json` and `experiments/operations-research/f-ops3-queue-aging-s186-synthetic-rerun.json` (using synthetic backlog slice file `experiments/operations-research/f-ops3-queue-aging-s186-synthetic-lanes.md`). Expectation: explicit backlog-slice injection should separate queue-aging from recency-bias so slot policy can progress beyond tie/null. Actual: live replay remains narrow (`ready_session_min=184`, `job_count=20`) and effectively tie (`score=0.9` both), while synthetic backlog replay separates policies (`job_count=26`, ready window `180..186`) but favors `recency_bias` (`0.4038` vs `-0.5077`) because naive queue-aging induces high `global_delay_rate=1.0` and `mean_positive_shift=2.0` despite stale-unresolved improvement (`0.0` vs `0.2308`). Diff: slot-1 produced actionable F-OPS3 signal (aging policy needs guardrails for global-delay/shift, not just stale reduction); coordinator can advance to slot-2 information-science.
S186: commit/push cadence repair initiated from user signal ("swarm havent commited or pushed for some time repair the swarm swarm way"). Check mode `coordination`; expectation was that backlog publish could be restored without introducing new maintenance DUE items. Actual: relay lane `L-S186-COMMIT-PUSH-RELAY` was claimed in `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`, active-lane scope collision was resolved append-only, and `pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/check.ps1 --quick` returned PASS with NOTICE-only (no DUE blockers). Diff: backlog is now publish-ready; next step is commit + push relay completion.
S186: F-OPS2 realized guard-vs-unguarded comparison landed via `tools/f_ops2_guard_comparison.py` with regression coverage (`tools/test_f_ops2_guard_comparison.py`, 3/3) and artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-guard-vs-unguarded-s186.json`. Check mode `coordination`; expectation was to close the open F-OPS2 follow-up by measuring guarded vs unguarded plans against observed lane pickup/collision/blocked churn instead of scheduler-only projections. Actual: comparator reads both artifacts + lane history and reports guarded preference on normalized risk signals (`collision_keyword_rate_per_row 0.0797 vs 0.1429`, blocked-transition rate parity `0.0`), but with pickup-rate regression (`0.7273 vs 1.0`). Diff: guarded profile remains the safer live default, but pickup recovery is now the explicit next optimization target.
S186: F-GAM3 no-op suppression pass landed. `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py` now supports `--suppress-noop-rows` (collapse repeated same lane/session/status rows before analysis), regression coverage expanded to `tools/test_f_gam3_signal_contract.py` 7/7, and paired artifacts were generated on the same snapshot: unsuppressed `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-msw2-s2-rerun3.json` vs suppressed `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-msw2-s2-noop-suppressed.json`. Check mode `coordination`; expectation was reduced status-noise distortion without changing lag/stale conclusions. Actual: strict adoption remained `18/172` and lag/stale stayed parity (`0.0` / `0.0`), while churn deltas dropped from `updates/lane +7.3015` and lifecycle-density `+5.1587` to `+0.9481` and `-0.1429` (`suppressed_row_count=129`). Diff: no-op suppression materially improves F-GAM3 signal quality; next leverage is a post-`S187` holdout rerun for matured strict-cohort viability.
S186: F-GAM3 holdout/F121 instrumentation landed. `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py` now exposes `f121_contract_ab` (`capabilities+available+blocked+next_step+human_open_item`) and latest-session holdout filtering (`--holdout-latest-sessions`); regression suite is now 9/9 (`tools/test_f_gam3_signal_contract.py`). Fresh suppressed artifacts `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-noop-f121.json` and `...-holdout1-noop-f121.json` confirm strict cohort presence (`19/187`) but zero F121-capabilities cohort (`f121_contract_lanes=0`, `capabilities_tagged_lanes=0`), so matured F121 A/B remains non-viable pending explicit `capabilities=` tagging rollout.
S186: F-GAM3 holdout-aware replay executed via `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py --holdout-latest-sessions 1 --suppress-noop-rows` with regression suite now 8/8 (`tools/test_f_gam3_signal_contract.py`) and artifact `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-msw2-s2-holdout-noop-suppressed.json`. Check mode `coordination`; expectation was cleaner matured-cohort signal after latest-session censoring + no-op suppression. Actual: holdout removed `314` latest-session rows (`cutoff=S185`) and no-op suppression removed `3` more, but strict cohort disappeared (`strict_contract_lanes=0/20`, matured strict `0/3`) so A/B viability remains false. Diff: suppression improves signal quality, but strict contract adoption is not yet cross-session durable; next action is explicit persistence of strict tags across sessions before the next matured-cohort rerun.
S186: F-OPS2 live guarded-cycle recalibration executed via `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py --agent-count 6 --capacity-bias 1.0` using floor probes (`--automability-floor 0.5`/`0.3333`/`0.2`) plus unguarded baseline (`experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-automability-floor50-cycle-s186-rerun.json`, `...-floor33-cycle-s186-rerun.json`, `...-floor20-cycle-s186-rerun2.json`, `...-multiswarm6-s186-next-cycle-rerun.json`). Check mode `coordination`; expectation was that floor `0.5` would remain guard-pass on current lane state. Actual: recommendation stayed `hybrid` with plan `operations-research:3`, `information-science:1`, `ai:1`, `brain:1`, but live automability dropped to `0.3333` (`2/6` accepted), causing floor `0.5` guard failure (`shortfall=0.1667`, effective net `357.126`) while floor `0.3333`/`0.2` pass (`effective net=390.466`). Unguarded remains non-dispatchable (`automability_rate=0.0`, `0/6` accepted, plan `operations-research:4` + `information-science:2`). Diff: live coordinator default should move from floor `0.5` to `0.3333` until dispatchable-capacity recovers.
S186: F-OPS2 guarded-vs-unguarded coordinator rerun executed (`coordination` check mode) via `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py --agent-count 6` to complete the planned guard comparison (`experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-automability-guarded-s186-rerun.json`, `...-automability-unguarded-s186-rerun.json`). Expectation: guarded routing should preserve immediate dispatchability and lower collision risk at a value-score cost. Actual: both runs kept `hybrid` as recommended policy, but guarded produced `automability_rate=0.5` (`accepted=3/6`, `collision_risk=1.0`, `net=249.2`, plan `operations-research:2` + `information-science:1` + `statistics:1` + `ai:1` + `brain:1`) while unguarded produced `automability_rate=0.0` (`accepted=0/6`, `collision_risk=4.0`, `net=386.8`, plan `operations-research:4` + `information-science:2`). Diff: guard increased dispatchability by `+0.5` and reduced collision risk by `-3.0`, at a projected-net tradeoff of `-137.6`; next step is live guarded-slot execution with realized lane pickup/collision tracking.
S186: F-OPS2 post-slot consolidation packet executed via `tools/f_ops2_post_slot_policy.py` (regression `tools/test_f_ops2_post_slot_policy.py`, 3/3) with artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-post-slot-policy-s186.json`. Check mode `coordination`; expectation was to convert completed slot outcomes into one coordinator-ready policy artifact. Actual: the packet unifies three live guards in one place: F-OPS1 default `wip_cap=4` (cap-5 promotion not ready), F-IS5 overlap baseline `shared_per_lane=2` with disagreement-reduction trigger (`collision>=0.6`), and statistics promotion lock held false while transfer remains inconclusive/high-heterogeneity. Diff: priority-1 consolidation is now executable from a single artifact and cross-linked across OR/statistics/information-science frontiers.
S186: F-IS3 tie-margin policy was operationalized in `tools/spawn_math.py` with configurable top-2 margin guard (`--tie-margin-min`) and conservative fallback to lower near-best `N` when the raw optimum is a near tie; `tools/test_spawn_math.py` now passes 11/11. Check mode `verification`; expectation was visible guard behavior in a low-cost near-tie regime while keeping cost-heavy calibrated recommendations unchanged. Actual: demo artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s186-tie-guard.json` shifts raw `N=5` to guarded `N=3` (`raw_top2_margin=0.000557`, candidates `[3,4]`), while calibrated-cost rerun `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s186-cost-calibrated.json` remains `N=1` (`tie_guard_triggered=false`). Diff: fragile-N promotion risk is now bounded in core spawn policy.
S186: F-OPS2 guard-floor stability rerun executed (`coordination` check mode) via `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py --agent-count 6 --capacity-bias 1.0` across artifacts `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-automability-floor20-live-s186.json`, `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-automability-floor50-live-s186.json`, and `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-automability-floor70-live-s186.json`. Expectation: identify the highest automability floor that preserves dispatchability without policy churn. Actual: `hybrid` remained top with identical plan (`operations-research:2`, `information-science:1`, `statistics:1`, `ai:1`, `brain:1`) and `automability_rate=0.5` at floors `0.2` and `0.5` (guard pass, accepted `3/6`), while floor `0.7` failed guard (`shortfall=0.2`, effective net penalty `-40`). Diff: floor `0.5` is now the live coordinator default; floor `0.7` is a stress bound, not an operating baseline.
S186: unguarded F-OPS2 next-cycle rerun executed via `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py --agent-count 6 --json-out experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-multiswarm6-s186-next-cycle-rerun.json` after regression confirmation (`tools/test_f_ops2_domain_priority.py`, 13/13). Check mode `coordination`; expectation was to measure drift between guard-aware and raw value scoring on current state. Actual: recommendation shifted to `value_density` with plan `operations-research:4` + `information-science:2` (`net=335.6`, `effective_net=335.6`) but `automability_rate=0.0` (`accepted=0/6`). Diff: unguarded scoring still maximizes projected value while failing immediate dispatchability, reinforcing the guarded scheduler profile as the safer coordinator default.
S186: F-OPS2 dispatch-guard floor validation executed via `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py --agent-count 6 --automability-floor 0.3333 --guard-penalty 200 --capacity-bias 1 --json-out experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-dispatch-guard-s186.json` with regression confirmation (`tools/test_f_ops2_domain_priority.py`, 13/13). Check mode `coordination`; expectation was that floor-constrained settings could preserve the `hybrid` recommendation while sustaining non-zero immediate dispatchability. Actual: recommendation stayed in the `hybrid`/`value_density` tier (`net=248.0`, `effective_net=248.0`) while maintaining automability at `0.5` (`accepted=3/6`, `guard_pass=true`) with executable slots `operations-research:2`, `information-science:1`, `ai:1`, `brain:1`, `statistics:1`. Diff: guarded live-dispatch profile remains floor-compliant and coordinator-ready under a stricter automability target.
S186: F-OPS2 dispatch-guard refinement completed. `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py` still supports `--capacity-bias`, `--automability-floor`, and `--guard-penalty` with guard-aware `effective_net_score`, and `capacity_bias` now also penalizes over-capacity picks so saturated domains stop monopolizing live slots; regression suite `tools/test_f_ops2_domain_priority.py` is 13/13. Check mode `coordination`; expectation was non-zero acceptance without abandoning high-value ranking. Actual: guarded replay `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-automability-guarded-s186.json` (`floor=0.2`, `capacity_bias=1.0`, `guard_penalty=200`) yields `automability_rate=0.5` (`3/6` accepted) with hybrid/value-density still top and executable slot mix `operations-research:2`, `information-science:1`, `ai:1`, `brain:1`, `statistics:1`. Diff: live scheduling now preserves strategic ranking while meeting a meaningful dispatchability floor.
S186: F-GAM3 slot-2 follow-up rerun executed via `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py --out experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-msw2-s2.json --min-maturity-sessions 1` with regression confirmation (`tools/test_f_gam3_signal_contract.py`, 6/6). Check mode `coordination`; expectation was non-empty strict cohort with clearer pickup-speed/stale separation after prior contract rollout. Actual: strict cohort stayed non-empty (`18/165`, `rate=0.1091`) but lag/stale remained parity (`0.0`/`0.0`), contract update volume spiked (`updates/lane 8.2778` vs `1.1293`, lifecycle-density delta `+4.9921`), and matured strict cohort is still unavailable (`0` lanes). Diff: signal quality is currently dominated by same-session churn, so next leverage is a one-session holdout plus no-op row suppression before rerunning.
S186: F-OPS2 automability replay executed via `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py --agent-count 6 --json-out experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-automability-s186.json` with regression confirmation (`tools/test_f_ops2_domain_priority.py`, 10/10). Check mode `coordination`; expectation was explicit measurement of scheduling automability, not only value/risk scoring. Actual: policy metrics include `automability_rate`, accepted/rejected decision counts, and dispatchable-capacity snapshots from latest lanes; recommendation remains `hybrid` (`net=383.1`, `projected_gain=389.1`, `collision_risk=4.0`) with `value_density` tied on net, but automability is `0.0` (`0/6` accepted), while `risk_first` has lower net (`293.334`) with higher immediate automability (`0.1667`, `1/6` accepted). Diff: F-OPS2 now exposes strategic-value vs live-dispatchability split; next leverage is a dispatch guard (automability floor or capacity-aware bias) plus lane-availability alignment.
S186: post-slot policy consolidation + next-cycle scheduler rerun executed. Check mode `coordination`; expectation was that slot-1..6 closure outcomes could be converted into explicit executable policy before launching a new queue. Actual: domain frontiers now codify the three consolidation guards (`domains/statistics/tasks/FRONTIER.md`: canonical gate authority/provisional rule, `domains/information-science/tasks/FRONTIER.md`: F-IS5 `shared_per_lane=2` baseline, `domains/operations-research/tasks/FRONTIER.md`: F-OPS1 cap-4 default with promotion criteria), and `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py --agent-count 6` produced `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-multiswarm6-s186-next-cycle.json` (`recommended_policy=hybrid`, net `257.7`, plan `information-science:3` + `operations-research:3`). Diff: coordinator is now unblocked for the next cycle with explicit policy gates in place.
S186: user safety directive ("swwarm always has to be safe swarm") was converted into executable MC-SAFE enforcement. `tools/maintenance.py` now flags active lanes with high-risk/irreversible intent unless `human_open_item=HQ-N` is present; regression coverage added in `tools/test_mission_constraints.py` (`high-risk without HQ` => DUE, `with HQ` => pass), and `SWARM.md` signaling now explicitly requires HQ references for high-risk lane actions.
S186: user-directed history reswarm executed via `tools/f_his1_historian_grounding.py` + `tools/f_his2_chronology_conflicts.py` with artifacts `experiments/history/f-his1-historian-grounding-s186-history-swarm-latest.json`, `experiments/history/f-his1-historian-grounding-s186-history-swarm-postrefresh-latest.json`, `experiments/history/f-his2-chronology-conflicts-s186-history-swarm.json`, and `experiments/history/f-his2-chronology-conflicts-s186-history-swarm-postrefresh.json` (tests: `tools.test_f_his1_historian_grounding` + `tools.test_f_his2_chronology_conflicts`, 7/7). Check mode `historian`; expectation was that latest active-lane provenance should remain fully grounded. Actual: pre-refresh latest grounding dipped (`historian_check_coverage=0.8`, `session_anchor_coverage=0.8`, `mean_grounding_score=0.8667`) because the newest `L-S186-MSW2-COORD` ACTIVE row lacked historian/session anchors; appending a refreshed coordinator row in `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md` restored latest grounding to full (`historian/artifact/session=1.0`, mean `1.0`). Chronology remained stable with improved missing-link rate (`0.0847`) and one residual inversion (`0.0085`).
S186: math experiment pass for F-IS3 completed via `tools/f_is3_math_validation.py` (regression `tools/test_f_is3_math_validation.py`, 3/3) with artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is3-math-validation-s186.json`. Check mode `verification`; expectation was low analytic-vs-sim error with stable calibrated recommendation under the cost-heavy model. Actual: 75 scenarios at 12k trials/scenario produced mean absolute utility error `0.003657`, exact best-N agreement `0.7733`, within-one-N agreement `0.9733`, and mismatch_low_margin_rate `1.0`; calibrated model stayed `N*=1` in both analytic and simulated paths. Diff: spawn-math is numerically reliable in the exchangeable-error regime, and disagreement is concentrated in near-tie margins.
S186: F-STAT3 domain-integrity replay executed via `tools/f_stat3_multiplicity.py --meta experiments/statistics/f-stat2-meta-analysis-domain-integrity-s186.json` with artifact `experiments/statistics/f-stat3-multiplicity-domain-integrity-s186.json`; regression `tools/test_f_stat3_multiplicity.py` remains 3/3. Check mode `verification`; expectation was that larger pooled study count would sharpen multiplicity signal without resolving transfer ambiguity alone. Actual: corrected discoveries rose to `3/3` (BH/Bonferroni) and candidate family remained `information_science_lane_distill` with higher replication (`5`), while paired F-STAT2 pooling remains inconclusive (`effect=-0.0301`, CI crosses zero). Diff: post-slot statistics consolidation advances, but promotion still needs explicit heterogeneity/regime guard before lock.
S186: F-META4 visual representability baseline executed via `tools/f_meta4_visual_representability.py` (regression `tools/test_f_meta4_visual_representability.py`, 3/3) with artifact `experiments/self-analysis/f-meta4-visual-representability-s186.json`. Check mode `coordination`; expectation was that the newly landed visual contract would be structurally present but could still show adoption gaps. Actual: contract primitive/view/freshness coverage is `1.0` and adoption checks are `5/5` (`README.md`, `memory/INDEX.md`, `domains/meta/tasks/FRONTIER.md`, `domains/meta/INDEX.md`, `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`), yielding overall score `1.0`. Diff: structural representability baseline is complete; next F-META4 step is behavioral validation (pickup-quality and contradiction-rate deltas under visual-guided handoff).
S186: F-IS6 stability rerun executed via `tools/f_is6_unchallenged_beliefs.py --out experiments/information-science/f-is6-unchallenged-beliefs-s186-rerun.json` after regression confirmation (`tools/test_f_is6_unchallenged_beliefs.py`, 3/3). Check mode `assumption`; expectation was that no challenge lane closure yet should keep the unchallenged profile effectively unchanged. Actual: baseline held exactly (`total_principles=166`, `challenged=1`, `unchallenged=165`, `unchallenged_ratio=0.994`, `longstanding_unchallenged_count=127`). Diff: F-IS6 signal is stable and still indicates high leverage in running a concrete challenge lane (starting with `P-032`) before next rerun.
S186: F-OPS3 broader-window replay executed via `tools/f_ops3_queue_aging.py --session-min 120 --stale-threshold 1` with artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops3-queue-aging-s186-broad.json`; regression suite `tools/test_f_ops3_queue_aging.py` remains 3/3 passing. Check mode `verification`; expectation was that broader/staler slicing would expose a queue-aging advantage. Actual: extraction still only spans `S184..S186` (`job_count=20`) and both policies tie (`score=0.7`, dispatched_rate `0.7`, stale_unresolved_rate `0.0`). Diff: null result is preserved and next action is explicit backlog-slice injection before any F-OPS3 policy conclusion.
S186: multiswarm slot-6 information-science execution completed (`L-S186-MSW2-S6-IS`) via `tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py` overlap-intensity sweep (`shared_per_lane=0/1/2`) using owner-A `selected` and owner-B `backlog` from `experiments/information-science/f-is5-arxiv-swarmable-s186-rerun.json`. Check mode `objective`; expectation was at least one non-zero transfer configuration with lower collision than the prior overlap run (`0.8`). Actual: sweep summary `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-tags-s186-overlap-sweep.json` reports `shared_per_lane=1` and `2` both at collision `0.6` (improved from `0.8`) with non-zero transfer (`0.0323` and `0.0882`), while `0` removes transfer signal (`0.0`). Diff: queue objective is achieved (slot-6 closed, measurable overlap baseline selected at `shared_per_lane=2`), but disagreement remains above `<0.5` target, so next F-IS5 step is disagreement-reduction before the next sweep.
S186: F-IS6 long-standing unchallenged-principles baseline executed via `tools/f_is6_unchallenged_beliefs.py` with regression `tools/test_f_is6_unchallenged_beliefs.py` (3/3), producing `experiments/information-science/f-is6-unchallenged-beliefs-s186.json`. Check mode `assumption`; expectation was a high unchallenged backlog with concentration in governance/evolution themes. Actual: `total_principles=166`, `challenged=1`, `unchallenged=165` (`0.994`), `longstanding_unchallenged_count=127`, with diverse top challenge set led by `P-032`/`P-081`/`P-001`/`P-007`. Diff: F-IS6 was added as an active information-science frontier with next action to execute a concrete challenge lane and rerun the audit for ratio delta.
S186: historian "historicn swarming" pass completed with lane-truthful closure of slot-4 history. `tools/f_his1_historian_grounding.py` now defaults to `row_mode=latest_per_lane` (with `--all-rows` fallback) and current active-lane grounding is full in `experiments/history/f-his1-historian-grounding-s186-historicn-rerun.json` (`active_rows=7`, `historian_check_coverage=1.0`, `artifact_ref_coverage=1.0`, `session_anchor_coverage=1.0`, `mean_grounding_score=1.0`). Historical audit remains partial in `experiments/history/f-his1-historian-grounding-s186-historicn-rerun-allrows.json` (`historian_check_coverage=0.2821`) due legacy rows. Companion chronology rerun `experiments/history/f-his2-chronology-conflicts-s186-historicn-rerun.json` now reports `missing_link_rate=0.0948`, `inversion_rate=0.0086`, `missing_artifacts=0`; coordinator advanced to slot-6 information-science.
S186: multiswarm slot-4 history execution completed (`L-S186-MSW2-S4-HIS`) via `tools/f_his1_historian_grounding.py`, producing `experiments/history/f-his1-historian-grounding-s186-slot4.json`. Check mode `historian`; expectation was visible grounding uplift on latest active rows after explicit lane-tag refresh. Actual: latest-per-lane active-row coverage reached `historian_check_coverage=1.0`, `artifact_ref_coverage=1.0`, `session_anchor_coverage=1.0`, and `mean_grounding_score=1.0` (`active_row_count=7`). Diff: historian provenance is now explicit in all currently active lanes; queue advances to slot-6 information-science.
S186: F-OPS3 first executable queue-aging baseline landed via `tools/f_ops3_queue_aging.py` with regression suite `tools/test_f_ops3_queue_aging.py` (3/3) and artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops3-queue-aging-s186.json`. Replay extracted 20 READY jobs (`session_min=150`) and compared `recency_bias` vs `queue_aging` under observed dispatch capacity; current window is parity (`score=0.65` each, mean lag `0.0`, stale_unresolved_rate `0.0`), so next OR step is widening the replay horizon/backlog slices before policy conclusions.
S186: F-OPS1 A/B decision-hint consistency fix landed in `tools/f_ops1_wip_limit.py` with added regression coverage in `tools/test_f_ops1_wip_limit.py` (now 7/7). Check mode `verification`; expectation was that A/B hint should never prefer a higher cap when `delta net_score < 0`. Actual: regenerated artifacts `experiments/operations-research/f-ops1-wip-limit-s186-slot3-ab45.json` and `experiments/operations-research/f-ops1-wip-limit-s186-slot3-bounded-ab45.json` now both emit `ab_hint=prefer_cap_a` while cap 5 still shows only yield gain and worse net score. Diff: slot-3 cap-4 default is now internally consistent; coordinator queue remains slot-4 history then slot-6 information-science.
S186: human signal ("swarm tries to extract value from all information whether positive or negative") was encoded into canonical protocol. `SWARM.md` + `beliefs/CORE.md` now treat positive/negative/null outcomes as first-class evidence, and `tasks/FRONTIER.md` advanced F88 with an enforcement follow-up.
S186: swarm-integrity hardening pass landed in `tools/maintenance.py` for lane contract quality. `check_swarm_lanes` now validates canonical `available` values (`yes|no|partial`) and reports legacy aliases (`ready|now|true|false`) as migration notices; regression coverage was added in `tools/test_mission_constraints.py` (new available-value cases) and validated with `bash -lc "python3 -m unittest tools.test_mission_constraints"` (49/49) plus `bash -lc "python3 -m unittest tools.test_swarm_lanes"` (4/4). Quick-check remains NOTICE-only with the new availability guard active for future drift.
S186: follow-up lane contract refresh appended to `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md` for active historian-focused lanes (`L-S186-DOMEX-AI/BRN/EVO/OPS`, `L-S186-MSW-S3-STAT`, `L-S186-MSW2-S6-IS`) so `historian_check` includes explicit surroundings anchors (`artifact` + `domain-frontier`) in addition to self anchors. This cleared transient historian-grounding DUE findings and kept maintenance at NOTICE-only.
S186: multiswarm slot-3 operations-research verification rerun executed via `tools/f_ops1_wip_limit.py --min-cap 3 --max-cap 5 --ab-cap-a 4 --ab-cap-b 5` with artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops1-wip-limit-s186-msw2-s3-rerun2.json` and regression confirmation (`tools/test_f_ops1_wip_limit.py`, 6/6). Check mode `verification`; expectation was durable cap-4 net lead. Actual: recommendation stayed `cap=4` but confidence dropped to LOW (`top_score_gap=0.0101`, runner-up cap 3), while A/B hint favored cap 5 completion-rate gain (`+0.0959`) at the cost of worse net (`-0.0893`), conflict (`+0.0227`), overhead (`+0.6182`), and blocked-per-merged (`+0.2146`). Diff: cap policy remains provisional; coordinator queue still advances to slot-4 history, then slot-6 information-science.
S186: multiswarm slot-3 operations-research execution refreshed via `tools/f_ops1_wip_limit.py --min-cap 3 --max-cap 5 --ab-cap-a 4 --ab-cap-b 5`, producing `experiments/operations-research/f-ops1-wip-limit-s186-msw2-s3.json` and revalidating `tools/test_f_ops1_wip_limit.py` (6/6). On 146 lane jobs (`observed_peak_wip=15`), recommendation stays `cap=4` with MEDIUM confidence (`top_score_gap=0.0281`); `cap=5` adds completion-rate `+0.0616` but increases overhead `+0.6250` and lowers net score `-0.1168`. Queue handoff remains slot-4 history lane (`L-S186-MSW2-S4-HIS`), then slot-6 information-science.
S186: slot-5 statistics execution completed (`L-S186-MSW2-S5-STAT`). Updated `tools/f_stat2_meta_analysis.py` to split FIN1 regimes (`direct_answer` vs `resolver_proxy`) and generated `experiments/statistics/f-stat2-meta-analysis-s186-rerun.json` over 26 studies: pooled effect stays inconclusive (`-0.0162`, CI95 `[-0.0599, +0.0275]`, `I2=49.5%`) with finance regimes near zero and IS5 dominating heterogeneity. Follow-on multiplicity rerun via `tools/f_stat3_multiplicity.py` produced `experiments/statistics/f-stat3-multiplicity-s186-rerun.json`: corrected discoveries `2`/`2` (BH/Bonferroni) and one provisional candidate family (`information_science_lane_distill`, replication_count `3`), but still high heterogeneity and mixed intervention regimes.
S186: F-CTL2 clock pass landed in `tools/f_ctl2_diff_latency.py` with regression suite now 10/10 (`tools/test_f_ctl2_diff_latency.py`). Summary now reports explicit same-session compression vs cross-session latency plus a minimum one-session clock floor (`same_session_resolution_rate`, `cross_session_mean_lag_sessions`, `mean_lag_floor_1_sessions`). Rerun artifacts (`experiments/control-theory/f-ctl2-diff-latency-s186.json`, `...-structured.json`) show commit-source lag stable at 1.0 session while structured-source remains low-sample and same-session (`rate=1.0`) but floor-1 lag still 1.0.
S186: F-CTL2 structured-lane rerun hygiene pass completed: `tools/f_ctl2_diff_latency.py` now accepts `--output` as alias for `--out` (CLI parity with other frontier tools), regression suite expanded to 9/9 in `tools/test_f_ctl2_diff_latency.py`, and `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl2-diff-latency-s186-structured.json` was regenerated with stable low-sample telemetry (`diff_events_total=1`, `mean_lag_sessions=0.0`).
S186: meta self-domain expansion landed from user signal ("swarm should expand its domain knowledge on itself"). `domains/meta/` was upgraded to parity with newer domains: refreshed `DOMAIN.md`, new `INDEX.md`, and executable frontier reset to `F-META1..3` (self-model contract, signal-to-action conversion, and self-improvement ROI). Routing and discoverability were wired by adding `domain_meta` mapping in `tools/context_router.py` and registering `domains/meta/tasks/FRONTIER.md` in global `tasks/FRONTIER.md`.
S186: domain-swarm value check executed from user signal ("swarm to see value of domainers swarm"). Objective-check expectation: if domain swarming is currently net-positive, scheduler scoring should remain positive and pooled transfer should be non-negative or improving. Actual: `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py --agent-count 6` produced `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-domain-valuecheck-s186.json` with `hybrid` net `221.3` (allocation: history `2`, game-theory `1`, operations-research `1`, information-science `1`, governance `1`), while `tools/f_stat2_meta_analysis.py` over 26 studies produced `experiments/statistics/f-stat2-meta-analysis-domain-valuecheck-s186.json` with pooled effect `-0.0162` and CI95 `[-0.0599, +0.0275]` (decision `inconclusive`). Diff: scheduling value signal is positive but transfer effect is still unresolved; next step is execute queued high-score slots and rerun F-STAT2 plus F-STAT3 multiplicity checks.
S186: F-GAM2 slot-2 execution progressed from planning to tagged rerun. `tools/f_gam2_reputation_integrity.py` (tests 5/5) first emitted assignment plan in `experiments/game-theory/f-gam2-reputation-signals-s186-rerun.json`, then after tagging lanes `L-S186-DOMEX-AI/BRN/EVO` produced `...-s186-rerun2.json` with non-zero active reputation coverage (`3/10`, rate `0.3`) and stronger integrity (`0.93`). Planner now reports `additional_tagged_needed=0`; next measurement should hold cohorts stable for >=1 session before comparing lag/conflict deltas because current tagged group remains high-activity/selection-biased (`updates/lane=6.0`, `conflict_rate=1.0`).
S186: swarm commit-expert profile added (`tools/personalities/commit-expert.md`) and documented for `tools/agent_swarm.py --personality commit-expert` usage. The profile introduces adaptive commit-accumulation control (default soft/hard triggers at 8/15 unpushed commits, overridden by newer OPS policy) plus required lane/NEXT signaling during backlog spikes.
S186: swarm usage-identifier-expert profile added (`tools/personalities/usage-identifier-expert.md`) and documented for `tools/agent_swarm.py --personality usage-identifier-expert` usage. The profile targets identifier hygiene by enforcing explicit lane/frontier/artifact references and reducing ambiguous handoff phrasing before promotion.
S186: swarm harvest-expert profile added (`tools/personalities/harvest-expert.md`) and documented for `tools/agent_swarm.py --personality harvest-expert` usage. The profile targets harvest quality by enforcing expect/actual/diff summaries, all-outcomes signal capture, and explicit lane-to-artifact routing before promotion.
S186: knowledge-to-domain swarmer expansion landed from user signal ("swarm the knowledge to create more domain swarmers"). Added three new domain shards with executable frontiers: `domains/protocol-engineering/` (`F-PRO1..3`), `domains/strategy/` (`F-STR1..3`), and `domains/governance/` (`F-GOV1..3`), each with DOMAIN/INDEX/tasks/FRONTIER files and active/open consistency. Global routing/state references were synchronized in `tasks/FRONTIER.md`, `memory/INDEX.md`, and `tools/context_router.py` so these domains are immediately dispatchable.
S186: swarm-the-swarm concreteness pass landed in domain frontiers: `domains/information-science/tasks/FRONTIER.md` now includes a copy/paste F-IS4 runbook (slot fan-out, blocker reassignment, overlap-tuning command), and `domains/history/tasks/FRONTIER.md` now includes executable F-HIS2/F-HIS3 examples grounded in chronology metrics from `experiments/history/f-his2-chronology-conflicts-s186.json`.
S186: coordinator rerun executed via `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py --agent-count 6` with artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-multiswarm6-s186-coord-rerun.json`. Policy remains `hybrid` but slot mix shifted to `game-theory:2`, `operations-research:1`, `history:1`, `statistics:1`, `information-science:1` (`net=268.6`, `gain=273.1`, `risk=3.0`); coordinator lane published new READY slot rows with explicit `wip_cap=<4|5>` tags for A/B-cap tracking.
S186: F-HIS2 chronology-conflict baseline+rerun executed via `tools/f_his2_chronology_conflicts.py` (+ regression `tools/test_f_his2_chronology_conflicts.py`, 3/3) with artifacts `experiments/history/f-his2-chronology-conflicts-s186.json` and `...-s186-rerun.json`. Current scan over NEXT+lane references reports `next_events_with_refs=96`, `matched=86`, `missing_link_rate=0.1042`, `inversion_rate=0.0104`, and `missing_artifacts=0`; next historian action is reducing missing-link events by adding lane-level artifact refs and reconciling the single S184/S185 inversion.
S186: historian-mode rerun executed via `tools/f_his1_historian_grounding.py` with artifact `experiments/history/f-his1-historian-grounding-s186-rerun.json`. Signal is unchanged from first baseline (`active_rows=44`, `historian_check_coverage=0.0`, `artifact_ref_coverage=0.0682`, `session_anchor_coverage=0.0`, `mean_grounding_score=0.0227`), confirming that historian provenance is still not propagating into active lane rows. Next step: enforce explicit `historian_check=<self+surroundings refs>` tags on active lanes and rerun for uplift.
S186: F-GAM2 baseline executed via `tools/f_gam2_reputation_integrity.py` with artifact `experiments/game-theory/f-gam2-reputation-signals-s186.json`. Lane integrity is currently strong on active rows (`integrity_score=0.9`, contract/stale/blocked/human-open all healthy), but reputation signaling is absent (`reputation_signal_rate_active=0.0`, tagged cohort `0`), so merge/handoff effect estimates are not yet identifiable. Tool emitted 5 swarm-to-swarm challenge prompts to drive next tagged-vs-untagged run.
S186: slot-1 statistics execution completed (F-STAT1 gate-policy reconciliation). Added `tools/f_stat1_canonical_policy.py` + `tools/test_f_stat1_canonical_policy.py` and generated `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-canonical-policy-s186.json`, reconciling three gate artifacts into canonical strict thresholds (`live_query`: runs>=15, n>=300, |effect|>=0.1733; `simulation`: runs>=4, n>=80, |effect|>=0.2442; `lane_log_extraction`: runs>=8, n>=34, |effect|>=0.4583). All classes remain `PROVISIONAL` due threshold dispersion; live_query additionally has practical-cap power gap (`power@300=0.2315`, n_for_80pct=1565) and mixed-regime risk.
S186: F-GAM3 analyzer maturity pass landed. `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py` now adds matured-lane A/B windowing (`--min-maturity-sessions`), lifecycle-normalized update-density metrics, cohort viability signaling, and active-row adoption trend output; `tools/test_f_gam3_signal_contract.py` is now 6/6. Refreshed artifact `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-rerun2.json` keeps strict adoption at `11/126` (`0.0873`) and shows noise gap narrows after lifecycle normalization (`updates/lane +2.298` vs `updates/lifecycle-session +0.1688`), while matured strict cohort remains not yet viable (`matured_cohort_viability=false`).
S186: F-HIS1 first historian-grounding baseline executed via `tools/f_his1_historian_grounding.py` with artifact `experiments/history/f-his1-historian-grounding-s186.json` (active rows `n=44`). Coverage is currently very low (`historian_check=0.0`, `artifact_ref=0.0682`, `session_anchor=0.0`, mean score `0.0227`), so next action is explicit `historian_check=<source refs>` tagging on active lane rows followed by rerun.
S186: repository-structure pass added `references/` + `recordings/` as first-class folders with canonical policy in `docs/SWARM-STRUCTURE.md`, map updates in README/INDEX, and maintenance enforcement (`check_structure_layout`) with regression coverage (`tools/test_structure_layout.py`) so disallowed file types in those folders are automatically flagged.
S186: F-GAM3 rerun2 executed via `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py` with artifact `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-rerun2.json`. Strict contract adoption remains `11` lanes but over larger history (`11/125`, `strict_rate=0.088`); all-lane lag/stale remain parity (`0.0`/`0.0`) while update intensity remains higher in contract cohort (`3.4545` vs `1.1579`, update-density delta `+0.1688`). Matured cohort is currently empty under `min_maturity_sessions=2`, so next pass should widen session span or lower maturity threshold for usable matured-lane A/B.
S186: F-EVO4 multi-branch evolution swarmability baseline executed via `tools/f_evo4_multibranch_swarmability.py` with artifact `experiments/evolution/f-evo4-multibranch-s186.json`. Verdict: `overall_multibranch_swarmable=true` (`verdict_strength=0.6667`) with `within_agent` score `0.9927` and `within_swarm` score `0.7240` passing, while `overall_swarm` is near-threshold (`0.6351` vs `0.65`) due to branch concentration (`local` dominates 115/123 lanes; effective branch count `1.2376`). Next step: raise explicit multi-branch lane continuity and reduce local-branch concentration.
S186: swarmability protocol hardening pass landed. `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py` now measures strict active-lane contract adoption (`setup/focus/available/blocked/next_step/human_open_item`) while still reporting legacy-key coverage for migration tracking; regression suite updated in `tools/test_f_gam3_signal_contract.py`. Strict-contract rerun artifact `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-strict-contract.json` reports `contract_lanes=11`, `free_form_lanes=114`, and closure-lag parity (`0.0` vs `0.0`). `tools/maintenance.py` F119 guard wiring now explicitly requires `check_structure_layout`, and `tools/test_mission_constraints.py` seed stubs were updated so guardrail drift is caught in regression runs.
S186: F-GAM3 lane-history rerun refresh executed via `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py` with artifact `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-rerun.json`. Explicit-contract adoption moved from `0/98` to `11/117` lanes with active-row `available+blocked+human_open_item`; closure lag and stale-active rate remain parity (`0.0` / `0.0`), while updates per lane remain higher in contract cohort (`3.4545` vs `1.1698`), indicating rollout progress but no status-noise reduction yet.
S186: F-GAM3 lane-history rerun2 executed via `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py` with artifact `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-rerun2.json` and delta summary `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-compare-rerun2.json`. Strict-contract cohort remains `11` lanes while total lane count rose to `125` (`strict_contract_rate=0.088`), closure/stale metrics remain parity (`0.0` / `0.0`), and status-noise gap persists (`contract updates/lane=3.4545` vs `free_form=1.1579`; update-density `3.4545` vs `3.2857`), so next work is handoff-window metrics beyond same-session closure samples.
S186: F-GAM3 handoff-window instrumentation landed in `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py` with mature-ready metrics (`mature_ready_window_sessions=1`, ready-to-progress lag tracking) while preserving backward-compatible ready-to-close fields; regression coverage is now 5/5 in `tools/test_f_gam3_signal_contract.py`. Refreshed artifact `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186-rerun2.json` reports strict adoption `11/126` (`0.0873`), lag parity unchanged (`mean_closure_lag=0.0`, `mean_ready_to_progress_lag=0.0`), and strict-cohort mature-ready censoring still high (`eligible=0`), so next rerun should wait at least one additional session before comparing mature unresolved rates.
S186: history domain seeded from human direction ("swarm the historian to swarm") — added `domains/history/DOMAIN.md`, `domains/history/INDEX.md`, and `domains/history/tasks/FRONTIER.md` with first frontier set (`F-HIS1..3`: historian-grounding coverage, chronology conflict detection, and historical drift slicing). Global references synchronized in FRONTIER/INDEX/NEXT/context_router so historian-check execution can swarm in parallel with existing domain lanes.
S186: F-OPS1 A/B instrumentation rerun landed. `tools/f_ops1_wip_limit.py` now emits `ab_comparison` + `recommendation_confidence` (`tools/test_f_ops1_wip_limit.py` now 6/6), and artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops1-wip-limit-s186-rerun2.json` over 115 jobs recommends `cap=4` with LOW confidence (`gap=0.003` vs cap 5). Requested `cap=3` vs `cap=5` A/B still favors cap 5 throughput/spillover, but with higher overhead and blocked-per-merged.
S186: F-OPS1 WIP-cap livecheck rerun executed via `tools/f_ops1_wip_limit.py` with artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops1-wip-limit-s186-livecheck.json` (`job_count=107`, `observed_peak_wip=9`). Recommendation remains boundary-high at `cap=5` (`net=0.3185`, `yield=0.9626`, `conflict=0.2519`, `overhead=1.6395`), so next operations-research step is sensitivity on conflict/overhead weights before hard-locking cap policy.
S186: multiswarm dispatch expansion executed for other domains. `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py --agent-count 6` produced `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-multiswarm6-s186.json` with `hybrid` recommendation (net `319.4`) and slot plan `statistics:3 + operations-research:1 + game-theory:1 + information-science:1`; companion reruns landed for F-OPS1/F-GAM3/F-EVO2/F-EVO3/F-STAT1/F-CTL3/F-PSY1 to keep non-primary domains swarm-active.
S186: F-STAT1 swarm-utilization measurement extended in `tools/f_stat1_reporting_quality.py` with `handoff_window_ab` (READY/CLAIMED -> first ACTIVE/BLOCKED/MERGED touch) plus cross-session latency fields, and regression coverage is now `tools/test_f_stat1_reporting_quality.py` 9/9 passing. Refreshed artifacts `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-reporting-quality-s186.json` and `...-s186-rerun.json` keep same-session parity (`schema_count=11`, `free_form_count=18`, mean delta `0.0`) but expose unresolved queued schema rows (`schema eligible=15`, `pickup_rate=0.0`, unresolved `15`) vs historical free-form pickup (`eligible=16`, `pickup_rate=0.4375`, unresolved `9`); next run should compare only matured sessions to avoid same-session censoring.
S186: F-IS5 controlled-overlap slice executed from the open information-science frontier follow-up. `tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py` now supports shared overlap injection (`--shared-per-lane`, `--shared-source`, `--shared-seed`) and produced `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-tags-s186-overlap.json` using owner-A `selected`, owner-B `backlog`, and one shared selected paper per lane. Result: duplicates stayed `0.0`, transfer acceptance rose from isolated-baseline `0.0` to `0.0323`, and contested candidates rose to `5`, but collision frequency also rose to `0.8`; comparison artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-tags-compare-s186-overlap.json` records this tradeoff for overlap-intensity tuning.
S186: F-OPS1 active-lane optimization landed as executable replay. Added `tools/f_ops1_wip_limit.py` + `tools/test_f_ops1_wip_limit.py` (4/4) and produced `experiments/operations-research/f-ops1-wip-limit-s186.json` by replaying 108 lane jobs at caps `N=1..5`. Current heuristic recommendation is `cap=5` (net `0.3199`, yield `0.9630`, conflict `0.2520`, overhead `1.6351`); next step is capped A/B dispatch (`cap=3` vs `cap=5`) before policy lock.
S186: F-FIN1 CI-backed direct-answer rerun executed via `tools/f_fin1_factual_qa.py` with artifact `experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-direct-rerun20-s186.json` (20 trials/condition, perturb_rate 0.25, bootstrap resamples 4000). Harness now emits `delta.bootstrap_ci95_n3_minus_n1`; current result is mean-inconclusive (`delta=+0.0041`, CI95 `[-0.0083, +0.0167]`, includes zero) with variance increase (`ratio=1.8939`) and high shared coupling (`pairwise=0.9667`). Next: targeted false-positive filtering (`Closed-ended question`, `The New Capital`, `Delhi`) then rerun.
S186: F-FIN1 false-positive hardening rerun executed via `tools/f_fin1_factual_qa.py` with artifact `experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-direct-rerun20b-s186.json` (20 trials/condition, perturb_rate 0.25, seed 188, bootstrap resamples 5000). Expanded extraction patterns + stricter fallback plausibility removed residual noise (`Closed-ended question`, `The New Capital`, `Delhi`); both conditions now score `N1=1.0000`, `N3=1.0000` (delta `0.0`, CI95 `[0.0, 0.0]`, includes zero), so the current capital-QA bank is saturated for diversification-effect claims.
S186: F-OPS2 non-swarm tooling rank pass executed (`tools/f_ops2_non_swarm_tools.py` + `tools/test_f_ops2_non_swarm_tools.py`, 3/3) with artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-non-swarm-tools-s186.json`. Top ready tools on this host: `git-worktree` (4.95), `gh-cli` (4.225), `uv` (3.625), `pytest-xdist` (3.6); top missing high-value installs: `jq` (3.675), `ripgrep` (3.6), `pre-commit` (3.025).
S186: F-GAM1 incentive baseline executed via `tools/f_gam1_incentive_baseline.py` (+ regression `tools/test_f_gam1_incentive_baseline.py`, 3/3), producing `experiments/game-theory/f-gam1-incentive-baseline-s186.json` from 5 cooperative-vs-competitive p155 replications. Competitive incentives increased deception proxy (`deceptor_delta_mean=+0.1921`) while reducing quality/yield proxies (`accuracy_delta_mean=-0.2517`, `productive_yield_proxy_delta_mean=-0.5314`), so baseline verdict is `cooperative_dominates`; next step is live-lane incentive A/B under real merge pressure with anti-deception constraints.
S186: F-CTL2 structured tagging executed for control-theory non-proxy telemetry. `tools/f_ctl2_diff_latency.py` now supports `--source lanes` (explicit Expect/Actual/Diff/Correction tags from `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`), regression suite expanded to 8/8 (`tools/test_f_ctl2_diff_latency.py`), and artifact `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl2-diff-latency-s186-structured.json` records first structured measurement (`diff_events=1`, `resolved=1`, `mean_lag=0.0`, low-sample same-session caveat).
S186: continuous self-repair guard added for lane-state quality. `tools/maintenance.py` now includes `check_lane_reporting_quality` in runtime `all_checks` and in F119 required-guard enforcement, and `check_swarm_lanes` now correctly treats explicit no-op states (`blocked=none`, `human_open_item=none`) as valid contract signals. Regression coverage expanded in `tools/test_mission_constraints.py` (new lane-reporting-quality tests; file now 39/39 passing), and `tools/test_swarm_lanes.py` remains passing (4/4). Refreshed artifact `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-reporting-quality-s186.json` now shows inferred+explicit saturation (`mean_score=1.0`, `explicit_mean_score=1.0`, `contract_ready_rate=1.0`, `explicit_contract_ready_rate=1.0`, `programmatic_swarmable_lanes=5`).
S186: lane contract enforcement hardened in maintenance/tests for F121/F-GAM3 continuity: active-lane structural checks now require explicit `available` + `next_step` tags (alongside `setup/focus/blocked/human_open_item`) and `tools/test_swarm_lanes.py` enforces the same contract. Appended contract-refresh rows for active domain-expert lanes so quick-check returned to NOTICE-only.
S186: prioritization-order refresh executed for swarm assignment focus (`bash -lc "python3 tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py --agent-count 4 --json-out experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-livecheck-s186.json"`). Live recommendation is `value_density` with slot plan `statistics:3` + `information-science:1` (net `261.3`); `For next session` was rewritten to this dispatch order with explicit lane-contract fields.
S186: F-PSY1 first context-load threshold baseline executed via `tools/f_psy1_context_load_threshold.py` with artifact `experiments/psychology/f-psy1-context-load-threshold-s186.json` (sessions 169..186, n=18). Joined lane + NEXT event load proxy currently shows weak/mixed signal (`corr=-0.2581`, best split threshold `1.9883`, `delta_low_minus_high=-0.4272`), so no robust high-load quality drop is established yet. Next: enforce explicit lane workload markers across multiple sessions and rerun with lane-dominant features.
S186: F-STAT1 reporting-quality swarm extension landed. `tools/f_stat1_reporting_quality.py` now adds full-history `pickup_latency_ab` (schema-contract vs free-form rows) and treats `human_open_item=none_recorded` as a clear/no-ask state for dispatchability; `tools/test_f_stat1_reporting_quality.py` is now 8/8. Refreshed artifacts `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-reporting-quality-s186.json` and `...-s186-rerun.json` report `active_lanes=5`, inferred `mean_score=1.0`, explicit `mean_score=0.6`, `programmatic_swarmable_rate=1.0`, and pickup A/B parity (`schema_count=10`, `free_form_count=18`, mean delta `0.0`).
S186: F-STAT1 rerun sync completed via `tools/f_stat1_reporting_quality.py` + `tools/f_stat1_experiment_gates.py` and targeted tests (`tools/test_f_stat1_reporting_quality.py`, `tools/test_f_stat1_experiment_gates.py`, 9/9). Refreshed artifacts keep reporting split at inferred (`mean_score=1.0`, `contract_ready_rate=1.0`) vs explicit (`explicit_mean_score=0.6`, `explicit_contract_ready_rate=0.0`), with programmatic dispatchable lanes `5/5`; experiment-gate rerun updates lane-log extraction threshold to `min_runs=8`, `min_abs_effect=0.1241` (`min_per_run_sample=28`).
S186: F-OPS2 findings-driven rerun executed with current state (`tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py` → `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-findings-s186-rerun.json`). Recommendation remains `hybrid` but slot allocation shifted to `statistics:3` + `information-science:1` (projected net `269.7`), reflecting heavy recent finding pressure in statistics.
S186: F119 continuity sync marker — explicit knowledge-state update recorded after current statistics/frontier/protocol edits to avoid tracked-delta drift without local handoff context.
S186: F-IS5 explicit-tag distillation rerun2 completed for the findings-driven information-science slot. `tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py` generated `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-tags-s186-rerun2.json` (seeds 2861/2862, per-lane=3) and comparison artifact `.../f-is5-lane-distill-tags-compare-s186-rerun2.json`: duplicate claim rate stayed `0.0`, transfer acceptance stayed stable (`0.0769` vs `0.075` baseline), and merge-collision frequency dropped (`0.3636` vs `0.7`).
S186: F-STAT3 first multiplicity-control pass executed via `tools/f_stat3_multiplicity.py` with artifact `experiments/statistics/f-stat3-multiplicity-s186.json` over 21 pooled studies. BH and Bonferroni each retain 1 discovery, but replication gating blocks promotion (`promotion_candidates=[]`): control-threshold and finance families have zero corrected discoveries; information-science has one corrected signal but only one replication (`min_replications_for_promotion=2`). Next step: class-split mixed regimes and expand independent replications before promotion use.
S186: F-STAT1 reporting-quality scorer hardened: `tools/f_stat1_reporting_quality.py` now emits inferred and explicit (tag-only) contract metrics; `tools/test_f_stat1_reporting_quality.py` remains passing (4/4). Refreshed artifact `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-reporting-quality-s186.json` reports inferred saturation (`mean_score=1.0`, `contract_ready_rate=1.0`) but explicit partial readiness (`explicit_mean_score=0.6`, `explicit_contract_ready_rate=0.0`), so explicit score is now the canonical promotion gate.
S186: Human correction applied: objective-function checking is not mandatory every time; swarm now treats checking itself as the invariant and objective-check as one optional lens. `SWARM.md` and `memory/OBJECTIVE-CHECK.md` were revised accordingly.
S186: F-STAT2 pooled-evidence baseline executed via `tools/f_stat2_meta_analysis.py` with artifact `experiments/statistics/f-stat2-meta-analysis-s186.json` (21 studies from FIN1/IS5/CTL1). Random-effects synthesis is currently inconclusive: pooled effect `+0.0013` with CI95 `[-0.0401, +0.0428]` (`I2=29.1%`); family split shows control-threshold positive-but-wide, finance near-zero, and IS5 negative-leaning/high-heterogeneity. Next step: class-split FIN1 regimes and apply F-STAT3 multiplicity controls before promotion use.
S186: GitHub mission-intake clarity hardened for F121/F-GAM3: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/swarm-mission.yml` now requires `state_sync`, `tools/maintenance.py` (`check_github_swarm_intake`) enforces that field, and `SWARM.md` signaling now explicitly requires Expect+Diff+state-sync completion for GitHub-native intake.
S186: F121/F-GAM3 coordination-clarity contract expanded across GitHub intake surfaces: mission + blocker templates now require `available`, `blocked`, and `human_open_item`, and `tools/maintenance.py` enforces these IDs in `check_github_swarm_intake`. Next phase: measure pickup-speed/stale-lane impact against verbose free-form updates.
S186: F-GAM3 first lane-history A/B measurement executed via `tools/f_gam3_signal_contract.py` with artifact `experiments/game-theory/f-gam3-signaling-contract-s186.json`. Current lane-row contract adoption is `0/98` (no explicit `available+blocked+human_open_item` triple), so contract-vs-free-form performance deltas are not yet identifiable. Free-form baseline: `mean_updates_per_lane=1.2449`, `stale_active_rate=0.0`, and closure lag `0.0` over lanes with active+closed session markers (`n=8`). Next action: emit explicit `available=` in active/ready rows and rerun.

S186: F-STAT1 practical promotion-gate replay rerun executed with tools/f_stat1_promotion_gates.py + tools/test_f_stat1_promotion_gates.py (3/3). New artifact experiments/statistics/f-stat1-promotion-gates-s186.json replays 73 artifacts (39 usable) and recommends class gates: simulation (n>=80, |effect|>=0.2442), live-query (n>=300, |effect|>=0.05, practical cap vs power-model 1565), lane-log extraction (n>=28, |effect|>=0.2195). Next: split live-query regimes (resolver-proxy vs direct-answer) and revalidate on post-S186 runs.
S186: F-STAT1 consolidated replay calibration executed via `tools/f_stat1_gates.py` with new regression coverage (`tools/test_f_stat1_gates.py`, 4/4) and artifact `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-gates-s186.json`. Cross-domain class gates from 27 evidence rows: live-query (`n>=300`, `|effect|>=0.1733`, HIGH), simulation-replay (`n>=43`, `|effect|>=0.1242`, LOW fallback), lane-log extraction (`n>=34`, `|effect|>=0.4583`, MEDIUM). Next action: reconcile this conservative replay with `f-stat1-experiment-gates-s186.json` and `f-stat1-promotion-gates-s186.json` into one canonical promotion policy.
S186: F-OPS2 scheduler upgraded to findings-driven routing. `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py` now parses `tasks/NEXT.md` "What just happened" lines and weights domain demand by fresh finding pressure (`finding_mentions`, `finding_priority_weight`), with new regression coverage in `tools/test_f_ops2_domain_priority.py` (7/7). New artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-findings-s186.json` recommends `value_density` and allocates `finance:2`, `control-theory:1`, `information-science:1`.
S186: psychology domain seeded from human direction ("swarm psychology to swarm") — added `domains/psychology/DOMAIN.md`, `domains/psychology/INDEX.md`, and `domains/psychology/tasks/FRONTIER.md` with first frontier set (`F-PSY1..3`: context-load thresholding, trust-calibration signals, status-noise minimization). Global references synchronized in FRONTIER/INDEX/NEXT/context_router so psychology can coordinate with game-theory/control-theory on swarm execution behavior.
S186: F-STAT1 first experiment-gate calibration executed — added `tools/f_stat1_experiment_gates.py` + tests (`tools/test_f_stat1_experiment_gates.py`, 4/4) and generated `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-experiment-gates-s186.json`. Class-gate outputs from FIN1/IS5/CTL1 families: live-query (`min_runs=15`, `min_per_run_sample=8`, `min_abs_effect=0.0477`), lane-log extraction (`8`, `28`, `0.1241`), simulation-control (`4`, `43`, `0.0389`). Next action: validate on post-S186 runs and split mixed scoring regimes (FIN1 resolver-proxy vs direct-answer).
S186: F-STAT1 power-replay follow-up executed — added `tools/f_stat1_promotion_gates.py` + tests (`tools/test_f_stat1_promotion_gates.py`, 4/4) and generated `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-promotion-gates-s186.json`. Replay-derived gates from 14 artifacts: simulation (`n>=100`, `|effect|>=0.0864`, 2/2 pass), live-query (`n>=132`, `|effect|>=0.0890`, 5/9 pass), lane-log extraction (`n>=26`, `|effect|>=0.1500`, 1/3 pass). Caveat: this is still S186-only calibration and must be revalidated on post-S186 runs before policy hard-lock.
S186: F-STAT1 power-replay rerun (broad-glob mode) completed — reran `tools/f_stat1_promotion_gates.py` + tests (`tools/test_f_stat1_promotion_gates.py`, 3/3) and refreshed `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-promotion-gates-s186.json` with 39 usable artifacts out of 73 considered. Updated thresholds: simulation (`n>=80`, `|effect|>=0.2442`), live-query (`n>=300`, `|effect|>=0.05`, practical cap; power-model target remains higher), lane-log extraction (`n>=28`, `|effect|>=0.2195`). This supersedes the earlier 14-artifact replay thresholds and reinforces that mixed live-query pooling requires class splitting.
S186: F-STAT1 reporting-quality baseline executed — added `tools/f_stat1_reporting_quality.py` + tests (`tools/test_f_stat1_reporting_quality.py`, 4/4) and generated `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-reporting-quality-s186.json`. Active-lane baseline: `active_lanes=5`, `mean_score=0.8`, `contract_ready_rate=0.0`; explicit `blocked` and `human_open_item` reporting are both at `0.0` coverage, so open-item fields must be emitted even when value is `none`.
S186: F-FIN1 direct-answer hardening rerun completed. Updated `tools/f_fin1_factual_qa.py` with fallback query chains and broader capital-pattern extraction; expanded tests to 7/7 (`tools/test_f_fin1_factual_qa.py`). New artifact `experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-direct-rerun-s186.json` (8 trials, perturb_rate 0.25) reports N=1 mean 0.7604 vs N=3 mean 0.7500 (delta -0.0104), variance ratio 0.0, and pairwise agreement 0.9653, indicating current direct-answer path is high-accuracy but strongly coupled.
S186: F-CTL2 first diff-to-correction latency baseline executed via `tools/f_ctl2_diff_latency.py` with artifact `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl2-diff-latency-s186.json` (S150+, max-window 12). Proxy result: `paired_count=10`, `unresolved_count=0`, `mean_latency_sessions=0.0` due to same-session diff+correction keyword co-occurrence. Action: move F-CTL2 to explicit `Expect/Actual/Diff` tagging before next rerun so latency is measured from structured events, not summary-text overlap.
S186: F-CTL2 rerun + classifier hardening landed: `tools/f_ctl2_diff_latency.py` now rejects negated phrases (`no expectation`, `no mismatch`) to avoid false diff triggers; `tools/test_f_ctl2_diff_latency.py` expanded to 5/5 passing. Updated artifact `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl2-diff-latency-s186.json` reports `diff_events=4`, `resolved=4`, `unresolved=0`, and mean/median/p90 lag `1.0`; auto-routing replay (`route-after=1`) found `eligible_events=0` and `projected_mean_lag=1.0`.
S186: F-FIN1 direct-answer scoring pilot shipped in `tools/f_fin1_factual_qa.py` (capital extraction from fetched summaries; mode=`live-wikipedia-capital-qa-direct-answer`) with artifact `experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-direct-s186.json`: at 1 trial/condition (rate-limit-safe run), N=1 accuracy 0.1667 vs N=3 accuracy 0.3333. This pilot is superseded by `f-fin1-factual-qa-direct-rerun-s186.json` (8 trials, hardened extractor path).
S186: statistics domain seeded from human direction ("statistics as domain...") — added `domains/statistics/DOMAIN.md`, `domains/statistics/INDEX.md`, and `domains/statistics/tasks/FRONTIER.md` with first frontier set (`F-STAT1..3`: power/effect gates, cross-domain meta-analysis, multiple-testing safeguards). Global references synchronized in FRONTIER/INDEX/context_router so statistics can coordinate and evaluate other domain swarms.
S186: F-CTL3 first open-loop vs closed-loop quality measurement executed via `tools/f_ctl3_open_loop_quality.py` with artifact `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl3-open-loop-vs-closed-loop-s186.json` (S150+). Closed-loop-tagged sessions outperformed open-loop on mean quality score (2.9943 vs 1.2155, delta +1.7788), and nearest-session matching remained positive (+0.5026). Caveat: classification is commit-log proxy and will improve once explicit loop-status tags are added.
S186: GitHub swarm-intake core-alignment pass landed: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/swarm-mission.yml` now requires `expectation` + `diff_signal`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/swarm-blocker.yml` now requires `state_sync`, and `tools/maintenance.py` adds `check_github_swarm_intake` to enforce required template IDs and workflow markers (`tools/swarm_pr.py plan`, `<!-- swarm-pr-plan -->`, `Swarm Intake Plan`). Quick check stayed NOTICE-only (`bash tools/check.sh --quick`).
S186: F-FIN1 evidence-stability pass: attempted larger live reruns via `tools/f_fin1_factual_qa.py` but networked resolver path timed out at higher trial counts in this runtime; added offline bootstrap confidence artifact `experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-s186-bootstrap.json` (delta +0.0833, CI95 [-0.0167, 0.1834]) and synced finance frontier/index to mark current mean-gain signal as unstable.
S186: investigated domain-priority swarming as an executable scheduler (not prose only). Added `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py` + `tools/test_f_ops2_domain_priority.py` (6/6 pass) and generated `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-s186.json` from live state (`NEXT` demand + domain frontier load + active-lane pressure). Policy comparison: FIFO net 13.5, risk-first 67.5, value-density 111.5, hybrid 111.5; tie-break picks hybrid and outputs a concrete 4-slot domain plan (`information-science:2`, `ai:1`, `finance:1`).
S186: domain-state health guard added to `tools/maintenance.py` via `check_domain_frontier_consistency`, which cross-checks each `domains/*/tasks/FRONTIER.md` active set against domain `INDEX.md` active-count/active-list/"What's open" claims using legacy-safe parsing (explicit `## Active` required). `python3 tools/maintenance.py --quick` stayed NOTICE-only after wiring.
S186: kill-switch schema hardening landed in `tools/maintenance.py` (`check_kill_switch`): malformed or partial `tasks/KILL-SWITCH.md` entries now emit `DUE` (missing required fields, invalid status/mode, or unparsable file) instead of silently defaulting to inactive, while active valid entries still raise `URGENT` and halt progression.
S186: F-IS5 explicit-decision scoring contract landed in `tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py` (`claim_id` + per-target `transfer_decisions=accepted|rejected`; tests now 5/5). New artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-tags-s186.json` reports `claims_total=28`, `duplicate_claim_rate=0.0`, `transfer_acceptance_rate=0.075` (3/40), and `merge_collision_frequency=0.7` (7/10 contested), replacing text-overlap collision proxy with merge-decision-grounded metrics.
S186: F-CTL1 first control-threshold calibration executed via `tools/f_ctl1_threshold_sweep.py` with artifact `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl1-threshold-sweep-s186.json` (latest-schema proxy-K window S131-S182, n=27). Candidate due/urgent thresholds `0.12/0.15` reduced alert burden vs current `0.06/0.10` (0.4815 vs 0.6296) with no additional misses in-window; confidence remains LOW due to one detected compaction event, so policy change is deferred pending broader replay.
S186: F-IS5 owner-isolation run completed with source-aware lane distillation (`tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py --source-a selected --source-b backlog`; tests now 5/5). Artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-s186-selected-vs-backlog.json` shows `claims_total=12`, `duplicate_claim_rate=0.0`, `merge_collision_frequency=0.0`, and `transfer_acceptance_rate=0.0`, confirming disjoint selected/backlog ownership removes collisions but also eliminates overlap-based transfer signal.
S186: F-FIN1 higher-sample low-noise replication completed via `tools/f_fin1_factual_qa.py --trials-per-condition 20 --perturb-rate 0 --seed 187` with artifact `experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-s186-rerun20-p0.json`: N=1 mean `0.2708` vs N=3 mean `0.2542` (delta `-0.0166`), while variance ratio improved to `0.6328` (`0.015885 -> 0.010052`). Signal: diversification can reduce variance even when mean gain disappears.
S186: F-IS5 two-pass distillation scoring executed from hardened intake (`tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py`) with independent seeded passes: `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-s186-pass-a.json` (`transfer_acceptance_rate=0.3514`, `merge_collision_frequency=0.3023`, `duplicate_claim_rate=0.0`) and `...pass-b.json` (`0.2195`, `0.1915`, `0.0`). Comparison artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-compare-s186.json` confirms stable zero-duplicate behavior but material transfer/collision sensitivity across passes; this motivated the explicit-tag and owner-isolation follow-ups captured in later S186 entries.
S186: F-IS5 intake stability quantified via `experiments/information-science/f-is5-arxiv-stability-s186.json`: run vs rerun overlap Jaccard=1.0 and lane-assignment agreement=1.0 (drift=0). Intake volatility is low; next risk is lane-owner distillation quality (transfer acceptance/duplicates/collisions).
S186: swarm self-repair hardened: added automated README protocol-drift guard in `tools/maintenance.py` (`check_readme_snapshot_drift`), wired into both F119 required-guard list and runtime `all_checks`. The guard enforces README snapshot/session+scale consistency against `memory/INDEX.md` and presence of `orient.py` startup guidance, preventing silent README/SWARM entry drift.
S186: human-triggered kill protocol implemented — added `tasks/KILL-SWITCH.md` + `tools/kill_switch.py` and wired `tools/maintenance.py` (`check_kill_switch`) so ACTIVE status (or `SWARM_STOP=1`) emits URGENT and halts swarm progression; activate/deactivate cycle validated and reset to INACTIVE.
S186: F-IS5 arXiv intake harness hardened for reproducibility — `tools/f_is5_arxiv_swarmable.py` now adds retry-aware fetch (`--retry-attempts`) plus explicit lane coverage/backlog accounting so lane packing does not silently drop papers. Rerun artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-arxiv-swarmable-s186-rerun.json` reports 24 papers, 5 lanes, `selected_count=20`, `backlog_count=4` (all backlog in `protocol-orchestration`); regression suite now 5/5 (`tools/test_f_is5_arxiv_swarmable.py`).
S186: F-IS5 arXiv intake swarmability bootstrap landed — added `tools/f_is5_arxiv_swarmable.py` + regression tests (`tools/test_f_is5_arxiv_swarmable.py`, 3/3 passing) and generated `experiments/information-science/f-is5-arxiv-swarmable-s186.json` from live arXiv query results (24 papers, 2026-02-08..2026-02-26). The artifact auto-partitions five distillation lanes (`protocol-orchestration`, `evaluation-scaling`, `memory-knowledge`, `tool-use-execution`, `safety-reliability`) with fixed claim-to-frontier task templates.
S186: README/SWARM consistency audit completed — `README.md` snapshot corrected from stale S179 to S186 (266L/171P/17B/20F, updated footprint/file-mix/object-store metrics) and startup loop aligned with `SWARM.md` protocol (`orient.py` + quick check + maintenance inventory). This closes public onboarding drift and keeps README guidance consistent with canonical swarm entry.
S186: F122 domain expansion pass seeded three additional knowledge domains — `domains/control-theory/`, `domains/game-theory/`, and `domains/operations-research/` (each with DOMAIN/INDEX/tasks/FRONTIER). These domains explicitly target current swarm bottlenecks: control-loop calibration (F-CTL1–3), incentive/mechanism alignment (F-GAM1–3), and scheduling/WIP optimization (F-OPS1–3). Global references were synchronized in FRONTIER/INDEX/context_router.
S186: F-EVO2 first automated extraction shipped (`tools/f_evo2_extract.py`) with artifact `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-retention-s186.json` (48 lane rows). Retention at threshold >=2 sessions currently flags one persisted base mutation (`L-UNDERSTAND-SWARM`), while top scope concentration is `tools/wiki_swarm.py` and `tasks/NEXT.md` (7 events each). Next step: join retained mutations to quality deltas for selection-pressure scoring.
S186: F-FIN1 factual-QA diversification redesign implemented with executable harness `tools/f_fin1_factual_qa.py` + regression tests `tools/test_f_fin1_factual_qa.py` (4/4). Latest live rerun (`experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-s186.json`, 5 trials each, seed 186, perturb_rate 0.4) shows N=1 mean 0.1667 vs N=3 mean 0.2500 (delta +0.0833) with unchanged variance (0.013889 vs 0.013889; ratio 1.0). Across S186 reruns the mean direction is not stable, so open caveat remains: resolver proxy, not direct LLM answer generation.
S186: F-IS4 self-knowledge swarm protocol scored with explicit criteria via `experiments/information-science/f-is4-self-knowledge-swarm-s186.json` — verdict PASS (17 merged S186 lanes; 14 mergeable artifacts; 10 cross-domain transfer candidates; 0 collision flags). This upgrades F-IS4 from feasibility-only to repeatable/scored operation.
S186: swarm history population-dynamics pass executed — synthesized `memory/SESSION-LOG.md` + `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md` into `experiments/self-analysis/swarm-history-population-dynamics-s186.json` (43 lane rows: 39 MERGED / 4 ACTIVE; recent S180+ knowledge delta: +15L/+7P). Signal: lane population is merge-heavy with low active residue, while knowledge throughput remains bursty but positive.
S186: child-swarm continuity verification passed for `experiments/children/architecture-test-minimal/`: handoff artifacts are present (`memory/INDEX.md`, `tasks/NEXT.md`), frontier shows bootstrap progress (F1 resolved, F3 opened), and child validator confirms belief integrity (`python3 tools/validate_beliefs.py` => 2 beliefs, 2 observed, 0 errors).
S186: F119 guard bookkeeping update - logged active non-knowledge deltas so maintenance continuity remains explicit while proxy/signal artifacts are in flight.
S186: scheduling-focus swarm pass completed. Due periodics executed and advanced in `tools/periodics.json` (`proxy-k-measurement`, `claim-vs-evidence-audit`, `mission-constraint-reswarm`, `state-sync` → S186). Evidence: `python3 tools/proxy_k.py --save` updated `experiments/proxy-k-log.json` (TOTAL 42,937), mission constraints regression revalidated (`python3 -m unittest tools/test_mission_constraints.py`, 34/34), and claim-vs-evidence audit artifact written to `experiments/self-analysis/claim-vs-evidence-s186.json` (confirmed ratio 0.1667, P-164 underchallenging not triggered). Lane latest-status scan confirms zero open lanes.
S186: F-IS3 coordination-cost calibration tightened — `tools/spawn_math.py` now supports `--calibrate-spawn-log` and merges cost estimates conservatively with AI2-derived values. New artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s186-cost-calibrated.json` infers coordination_cost≈0.567 from spawn-log events and flips recommendation from N*=6 to N*=1 (no-spawn), making overhead measurement the decisive variable.
S186: scheduling-quality audit via `python3 tools/change_quality.py` shows no current improvement trend: S184-S186 rated WEAK (scores 0.00) with 50/50/0% overhead and no L/P/frontier advancement; long-term trend remains DECLINING (-38%). Action: scheduling-quality elevated to top next-session priority.
S186: self-knowledge swarming feasibility investigation completed — added F-IS4 in information-science frontier to formalize swarming the swarm's domain map/frontier graph. Evidence basis: S182 parallel domain run already succeeded (feasibility YES), with failures concentrated in coordination overhead rather than knowledge cascades. Next action encoded: run 3 domain lanes + 1 coordinator lane and score transfer/collision criteria.
S186: F-AI1 independent live rerun executed via `tools/f_ai1_evidence_surfacing.py --live --trials 160 --perturb-rate 0.35 --seed 186 --lang en` with artifact `experiments/ai/f-ai1-live-evidence-s186.json`: async error 0.275 vs evidence-surfacing 0.0813 (delta -0.1938) while sync error stayed 0.3063; caveat = current live harness uses perturbation-status as confidence proxy (optimistic upper bound), so next step is non-oracle confidence scoring.
S186: F-AI1 live integration shipped in `tools/wiki_swarm.py` (`--ai1-live-experiment`) with artifact `experiments/ai/f-ai1-live-evidence-surfacing-s186.json`: async follower error 0.315 vs evidence-surfacing 0.215 (delta -0.100) while remaining below full-sync coupling (corr 0.3935 vs 1.0); `tools/test_wiki_swarm.py` now 9/9 passing.
S186: F-AI2 partial-sync sweep aggregated into a single threshold artifact `experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-partial-sync-threshold-s186.json`: across live EN runs, sync correlation scales with inheritance probability (0.2947 @ p=0.25, 0.40-0.47 @ p=0.50, 0.7188 @ p=0.75, 1.0 @ p=1.0), placing the practical cascade-onset band near p=0.3-0.5.
S186: F-IS3 real-trace calibration executed via `tools/spawn_math.py --calibrate-ai2-glob "experiments/ai/f-ai2-*.json"` (5/5 spawn_math tests pass). Calibrated report `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s186-calibrated.json` inferred rho≈0.032 from 12 AI2 artifacts (5,260 trials) and returns N*=6 under a low explicit coordination-cost floor (0.01), highlighting that cost calibration is now the dominant open variable.
S186: F-IS3 cost-threshold breakpoint artifact added (`experiments/information-science/f-is3-cost-threshold-s186.json`) from calibrated model: coordination cost `<=0.053` keeps recommendation at `N>=3`, `0.054..0.123` collapses to `N=2`, and `>=0.124` flips to no-spawn (`N=1`).
S186: F-IS3 sensitivity-to-policy bridge completed — mapped sensitivity regimes to executable spawn presets in `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-presets-s186.json`: P0 no-spawn (high coupling/overhead), P1 duo (bounded default), P2 broad (low-coupling exploration). Remaining gap is measuring real coordination cost to route runs automatically.
S186: F-AI2 live partial-sync threshold sweep completed (`tools/wiki_swarm.py --coord-live-experiment --sync-inherit-prob {0.25,0.5,0.75,1.0}`; 300 trials each, seed 186). New artifacts `experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-partial-sync-025-s186.json` through `...-100-s186.json` show graded cascade coupling: sync leader-follower correlation scales 0.2947 -> 0.4023 -> 0.7188 -> 1.0 as inherit probability increases, with sync joint-error above async at every step.
S185: F-AI2 live partial-sync regime added to `tools/wiki_swarm.py` via `--sync-inherit-prob` with regression coverage (`tools/test_wiki_swarm.py`, 8/8). First 300-trial EN run at inherit-prob 0.5 (`experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-partial-sync-s185.json`) shows intermediate cascade behavior: sync corr 0.473 and joint error 0.2067 (between async 0.10 and full-sync 0.27), supporting graded cascade intensity.
S186: F-AI1 controlled evidence-surfacing experiment validated (`tools/f_ai1_evidence_surfacing.py` + `tools/test_f_ai1_evidence_surfacing.py`, 2/2 tests pass) and rerun (`experiments/ai/f-ai1-evidence-surfacing-s186-rerun.json`): async follower error 0.349, sync-copy 0.355, confidence-gated evidence-surfacing 0.280 (delta -0.070 vs async). Direction from first pass holds: selective pre-reasoning evidence sharing improves accuracy without full sync coupling.
S186: F-AI2 live perturbation replication executed (`tools/wiki_swarm.py --coord-live-experiment --trials 200 --perturb-rate 0.35 --seed 186 --lang en`) with artifact `experiments/ai/f-ai2-hlt2-live-perturb-s186.json`: async correlation stayed near-zero (-0.0254) while forced sync remained 1.0; async joint error 0.115 vs sync 0.35 (~3.0x). Directional result remains stable.
S185: F-IS3 math-to-swarm bridge implemented — added `tools/spawn_math.py` + `tools/test_spawn_math.py` (4/4 pass) and generated `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s185.json`; with baseline_quality=0.65, baseline_std=0.20, rho=0.2, coordination_cost=0.03 the model recommends N*=2 (spawn=true) while N>=3 is net-negative, turning variance/cost math into an executable spawn decision.
S185: F-AI2/F-HLT2 live query-perturbation replications executed via `tools/wiki_swarm.py --coord-live-experiment`: EN 200-trial run (`experiments/ai/f-ai2-hlt2-live-perturb-s186.json`) yielded async corr -0.0254 vs sync 1.0 with joint error 0.115 vs 0.35 (~3.0x); ES 200-trial run (`experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-query-perturb-s185-es.json`) yielded async corr -0.0534 vs sync 1.0 with joint error 0.15 vs 0.37 (~2.5x). Directional result holds across language settings: forced synchronization amplifies cascades.
S185: compactness swarm pass executed on highest-growth knowledge tier: compacted `tasks/FRONTIER.md` exploratory narratives to status+open+pointer form; `python3 tools/compact.py` moved proxy-K drift from +7.5% DUE (43,795t) to +5.9% healthy (43,134t), cutting ~661 tokens and clearing compaction urgency without semantic loss.
S185: F-AI2/F-HLT2 live perturbation run added (`tools/wiki_swarm.py --coord-live-experiment --trials 120 --perturb-rate 0.4 --seed 185`) with artifact `experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-perturbation-s185.json`: async leader-follower correlation stayed near zero (-0.0071) while forced sync remained 1.0; sync joint error 0.4667 vs async 0.15 (~3.1x). Added request-throttle resilience in `wiki_swarm.py` (retry/backoff + low-cardinality query banks) and extended tests (`tools/test_wiki_swarm.py`, 7/7 passing).
S185: Additional live perturbation replication (`tools/wiki_swarm.py --coord-live-experiment --trials 120 --perturb-rate 0.35 --seed 185`) wrote `experiments/ai/f-ai2-hlt2-live-perturb-s185.json` with the same direction: async correlation -0.0341 vs sync 1.0; async joint error 0.1 vs sync 0.3583.
S184: F-AI2/F-HLT2 controlled sync-correlation replicated at larger N (`tools/wiki_swarm.py --coord-experiment --trials 2000 --error-rate 0.2 --seed 184`): async leader-follower error correlation stayed near zero (-0.0162) while forced sync remained perfectly correlated (1.0), and joint error rate stayed ~5.4x higher under sync (0.2025 vs 0.0375). Artifact: `experiments/ai/f-ai2-hlt2-sync-correlation-s184.json`.
S185: F-AI2/F-HLT2 controlled replication rerun (`tools/wiki_swarm.py --coord-experiment --trials 1000 --error-rate 0.2 --seed 155`) generated `experiments/ai/f-ai2-forced-sync-s185.json` with the same direction as prior run: async correlation -0.0317 (joint error 0.03) vs sync correlation 1.0 (joint error 0.20); regression checks now pass for both paths (`python3 -m unittest tools/test_wiki_swarm.py` and `tools/test_p155_live_trace.py`, 5/5 each).
S184: `understand the swarm and swarm` continuation applied as live-state authorization — HQ-11 closed in HUMAN-QUEUE, HUMAN-SIGNALS harvested with new orientation-first pattern, and periodics advanced (`state-sync`, `human-signal-harvest`, `change-quality-check` → S184).
S184: quality periodic rerun (`python3 tools/change_quality.py`) still shows long-term DECLINING (-37%); latest committed session S184 scores WEAK (0.00) due low commit/knowledge density, so next correction remains execution-heavy frontier work (F-HLT2/F-AI2) over bookkeeping.
S184: P-155 harness upgraded for expect-act-diff automation — `tools/p155_live_trace.py` now accepts `--baseline` and emits `baseline_comparison.delta_comparison[*].abs_diff`; rerun-3 vs S147 reports 0.0000 across all three delta keys, so parity no longer requires manual JSON math.
S184: P-155 second rerun parity check (`p155-live-trace-s184-rerun-2.json`) exactly matches `...rerun.json` on both primary deltas (deceptor +0.1858333333, accuracy -0.2442500000) — confirms deterministic harness stability for fixed config/seed.
S184: PowerShell orient fast-path restored — added `tools/orient.ps1` wrapper with bash/python fallbacks and wired SWARM/NEXT references so `swarm` remains one-command on Windows hosts where `python3`/`py -3` are unavailable or misconfigured.
S184: orient stale-experiment detection hardened — `tools/orient.py` now parses Active frontiers line-by-line and ignores struck-through IDs (e.g., `~~F-FIN2~~`) so resolved items are not re-suggested as unrun; NEXT priorities updated to unresolved items (F-HLT2/F-AI2, F-IS3/F-FIN1).
S184: P-155 live-trace rerun executed (`tools/p155_live_trace.py` → `experiments/colonies/p155-live-trace-s184-rerun.json`) and exactly matched S147 deltas (absolute diff 0.0000): competitive incentives raised deceptor share by +0.1858 and reduced group accuracy by -0.2443 vs cooperative context; confirms stability of the incentive-deception signal under fixed harness/seed.
S184: maintenance DUE cleared — compacted L-261 (22→16 lines) and L-266 (21→16 lines) to pass lesson-length policy while preserving rules/findings; promoted L-267 from draft and ran `python3 tools/sync_state.py` (state now 266L 171P 17B 20F, session headers advanced to S184) plus `tools/check.ps1 --quick` (NOTICE-only).
S183: F-IS2 REFUTED (L-264): PRINCIPLES.md citation distribution is flat (α=0.21), not Zipf — lesson→principle is 1:1 provenance mapping not a retrieval corpus; 66% zero-citation; B-IS2 needs full-corpus retest. Also: stale proxy-K DUE warning in NEXT.md fixed (floor was updated to 40,749t S180; actual drift +4.7% healthy). 263L 171P 17B 20F.
S182: information-science domain seeded — `domains/information-science/` created with 9 isomorphisms (5 OBSERVED, 4 structural parallels), 3 frontiers (F-IS1: entropy=compaction predictor; F-IS2: Zipf exponent drift; F-IS3: F1-optimal spawn threshold), B-IS1/B-IS2/B-IS3. Key insight (L-256): swarm already practices information science under different names — MDL/proxy-K, Zipf/citations, info decay/obsolescence, index freshness, adverse selection/dark files. Domain audit = renaming + cross-domain transfer. F122 4th domain complete. 256L 169P 17B 19F.
S183: swarmibility-audit — SWARM.md v0.5: orient.py fast path + sync_state.py/validate_beliefs.py + mandatory meta-reflection added. Non-Claude tools (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Gemini, Codex) had partial swarmibility — protocol improvements existed only in .claude/commands/swarm.md (Claude Code-specific). L-252 + HUMAN-SIGNALS.md signal encoded. Pattern: improvements must propagate to SWARM.md or silently degrade non-Claude swarmibility. 253L 169P 17B 19F.
S183: F-FIN1 quality-metric CONFIRMED (L-253) — bootstrap over 86 sessions: std ratio 0.574 vs predicted 1/√3=0.577 (0.6% off); variance reduction 67.1%; mean drift 0.5%. Portfolio diversification holds for quality metrics (mean-of-N), not wall time (max-of-N, L-251). L-245 compressed to ≤20L. F-FIN1 finance frontier updated. 253L 169P 17B 19F.
S182: maintenance continuity session: L-238/L-244/L-251 compressed or cross-referenced; P-053/P-194/P-195/P-196 zero-citation NOTICEs cleared; PAPER scale drift cleared repeatedly (concurrent sessions active throughout); P-188/P-189 ID collision resolved; pushed 12+ accumulated unpushed commits. Meta: concurrent sessions handle continuity and new content at very high rate — maintenance node role is drift patrol + push relay.
S182: F-HLT3 REFUTED (independent convergence with L-242): proxy-K drift ACCELERATES post-compaction (+175→+478→+788t/sess); homeostasis analogy refuted; rising sawtooth (P-163) confirmed. maintenance.py dirty-tree guard fixed — was suppressing URGENT at +13.1% drift (threshold was 30%, now 10% for DUE on dirty tree); L-249 filed. 248L 167P 17B 19F.
S182: first real swarm-of-swarms execution — 3 parallel domain agents; F-HLT1 REFUTED (L-241: corrective lessons=antibiotics not memory-cells; discovery lessons embed as structural DNA); F-HLT3 REFUTED (L-242: proxy-K rising sawtooth, 1.5× post-compaction growth, P-163 confirmed); F-AI3 baseline 6.3% (L-243, revisit S192). Human "not fully utilizing swarms" → P-194 (documentation debt); L-246. Agents self-coordinated number conflicts (L-241/242/243 self-assigned). 247L 167P 17B 19F.
S182: "swarm should swarm swarms repair in a swarm way" → parallel repair: 3 agents dispatched simultaneously for L-071 orphan + L-078 orphan + F-HLT1; L-078: P-193 extracted (organic self-organization sufficient; imposed structure accelerates not determines); parallel repair is THE repair pattern — independent repairs should always be parallel-dispatched. 253L 169P 17B 19F.
S182: L-071 orphan resolved — P-077 strengthened: stability ceiling (100% observed rate) now a design constraint, not observation; production variants must reweight fitness as observed_rate × belief_count; volume-only metric is a research artifact; two distinct scoreboards structurally enforced (L-071, P-077, dc5cb8c).
S181: sync_state.py PAPER auto-sync: PAPER.md "NNN lessons, MMM principles" line now auto-patched alongside INDEX/FRONTIER/NEXT/PRINCIPLES — eliminates recurring PAPER scale DUE overhead. Converged from concurrent session (same meta-improvement, parallel arrival). expect-act-diff (CORE.md P11, memory/EXPECT.md, F123, L-223, P-182) fully live across SWARM.md/.claude/commands. 243L 166P 17B 18F.
S181: maintenance continuity: L-238 compressed (age-normalized Sharpe lesson, 24→15L); P-053 zero-citation fixed (L-047 reference added); PAPER 162P drift cleared; 12+ unpushed commits pushed; P-188/P-189 collision resolved by concurrent session. Meta: concurrent sessions active during handoff — orient fast, pick non-overlapping work.
S181: P-077/P-084 orphan resolution — L-071/L-078 mechanisms extracted: P-077 enriched (quality gate vs fitness comparator design rule, L-071 absorbed); P-084 enriched (structure self-organizes without imposed modes; late-bloomer pattern = valid strategy, L-078 absorbed). orient.py wired into check.sh step 12. fundamental-setup-reswarm periodic advanced S173→S181.
S182: health-check 5/5 (due S182, cadence 5, last S177): 238L 161P, knowledge growth/accuracy/compactness/belief-evolution/throughput all healthy; domains/ai+finance+health seeded; F-FIN3 confirmed; git-safety hardened; P-189/P-190/P-191 added. Periodics: health-check advanced S177→S182. Meta-swarm: context-compaction recovery is low-friction — concurrent sessions handle continuity; the swarm doesn't stop.
S181: F-FIN3 RESOLVED — L-056–L-080 "forgotten middle" validated: 18/25 absorbed into PRINCIPLES.md (success), 5 active, 2 orphans (L-071/L-078 need principle extraction). L-235: zero-Sharpe ≠ dead — absorption IS retirement; true test = zero-Sharpe AND not in any principle. P-188 updated (B-FIN3 CONFIRMED). Sharpe metric correction: external citations undercount value. 238L 161P 17B 18F.
S181: F121 advance: pattern-to-principle audit of HUMAN-SIGNALS.md (11 patterns vs PRINCIPLES.md); 9/11 encoded, enforcement-audit gap found+closed (P-191, L-237). State sync 238L 161P 17B 18F.
S180: git safety hardening: identified mass-deletion root cause (aa4d5f8 — WSL filesystem corruption staged 729 file deletions via git add -A); L-234 filed (WSL corruption → git add -A mass-deletion pattern); P-188 added (never use git add -A/. in swarm repos); sync_state.py RuntimeError guard added (git ls-files failure now aborts instead of writing 0); L-231 Sharpe lesson trimmed ≤20L (DUE cleared). Meta-swarm: git add -A is the highest-risk swarm operation — named-file adds are now protocol. 235L 159P 17B 18F.
S179: F-FIN3 full-corpus Sharpe: L-1/L-5/L-12 top (Sharpe 1.2–2.3); L-56–L-80 "forgotten middle" zero-citation cluster (28/229, 12.2%); B-FIN3 PARTIALLY CONFIRMED; L-232 + P-188 filed (lesson Sharpe as compaction gate). Meta-swarm: index.lock contention + mass-deletion incident (aa4d5f8) = two structural git-safety gaps; need retry wrapper + rm-cached safety check.
S179: PAPER session counts updated (176→179, 175→179); maintenance.py WSL swarm.md corruption check added; sync_state.py 0-count safety guard added (L-233); meta-swarm: WSL corruption is the recurring friction — now auto-detected.
S180: principles-dedup (P-123→P-175 superseded: enforcement tiers is strict superset); L-229/L-230/L-231 state clean; PAPER updated to 232L 159P 17B 18F; periodics markers advanced (principles-dedup S170→S180, state-sync S179→S180). Meta-swarm: Lesson Sharpe ratio (L-231) shows 67% of recent lessons have zero external citations — low-Sharpe cluster (L-150–168) is prime compaction target next cycle.
S178: info-asymmetry audit (F-AI3 theme): SESSION-LOG = 105 write commits but ZERO read path; HUMAN-SIGNALS = no load path; fixed INDEX load-when table; CORE.md hash FAIL repaired. L-225 filed.
S178: F122 PARTIAL — domains/ai/ seeded: DOMAIN.md + INDEX.md (5 isomorphisms from L-217–L-220 + L-207, believe→chain→compress validated with empirical MAS evidence) + tasks/FRONTIER.md (4 domain frontiers F-AI1–F-AI4). F122 updated PARTIAL in global FRONTIER.md. NEXT.md priorities reordered (F121 #1, F122 extend #2).
S178: sync_state.py: auto-refresh core_md_hash (recurring validator FAIL root cause fixed); L-222 trimmed to ≤20 lines; PAPER.md 153P→154P drift cleared; state-sync periodic advanced to S178. Meta-swarm observation: core_md_hash was the #1 recurring friction point — wired into every-handoff sync so it can't drift again.
S180: F-FIN3 orphan detection: 5 zero-Sharpe lessons validated — 4/5 SUPERSEDED (P-062/P-071/P-076/P-081), 1/5 ORPHANED (L-060). P-190 filed (task clarity = spawn gate). L-236. Zero-Sharpe requires child-swarm cite check, not just PRINCIPLES.md. F-FIN3 RESOLVED.
S180: change-quality-check: DECLINING trend (-49%) confirmed. S176-S177 WEAK (50-62% overhead). S178 STRONG (6.09, bulk concurrent work). Tool surfacing actionable session-quality signals.
S178: change-quality-check: change_quality.py built (L-223); periodic registered (cadence 5); first run DECLINING -57% long-term trend found; S176 57% overhead flagged. Human signal: measuring quality vs. past is core swarm function.
S178: expect-act-diff primitive: CORE.md v0.6 principle 11; memory/EXPECT.md created; L-223+P-182+F123 filed; HUMAN-SIGNALS.md updated. 223L 154P 14B 18F.
S178: paper-reswarm v0.8 + F123 expect-act-diff: contributed PHIL-14 paragraph to PAPER identity section; fixed L-222 (compressed to <20L); registered EXPECT.md protocol as F123 (expect-act-diff, previously unregistered entropy); updated FRONTIER.md to 18F, INDEX.md hash renewed (CORE.md drift resolved). Validator PASS 100/100.
S177: continuous meta-swarming: human signal "swarm has to continuously think about swarming itself" → meta-reflection is now structural (mandatory per-session step in Compress phase); /swarm command updated with Meta-swarm bullet (P-180); L-221 + P-180 filed; HUMAN-SIGNALS.md updated; swarm.md WSL-corruption fixed.
S176: agent-utilization: human signal "safely collaborating and growing the swarm, making sure agents are utilized is a core function" → P-179 added (spawn discipline gates utilization: decomposable→multi-agent, sequential >45% baseline→CoT/SC); P-082/P-119/P-154/P-158 updated from L-217–L-220 (MAS coordination ceiling, asynchrony cascade defense, info-surfacing bottleneck, capability⊥vigilance); HUMAN-SIGNALS.md S176 entry + pattern; swarm.md WSL corruption fixed; F119 learning-quality gap closed. Validator PASS.
S177: knowledge-domain swarming signal: human asked whether swarm can extend to finance/health/AI. Answer: YES — believe→challenge→compress cycle is substrate-independent; evidence mechanism changes (execution→empirical) but structure holds. Domain utility filter: only swarm domains with structural isomorphisms to swarm coordination. AI highest ROI (direct self-reference). F122 filed (knowledge-domain swarming), L-222 filed, P-181 filed. HUMAN-SIGNALS.md updated. 223L 153P 14B 17F.
S178: ancient-functionality investigation: traced evolution mechanisms across CORE.md (8 commits v0.1→v0.5), maintenance.py (36 commits), swarm.md (8 commits). Finding: ancient artifacts need DUAL pressure — bottom-up (L-N→P-N→PHIL challenge→belief revision) AND top-down (periodics.json forces scheduled revisit at cadences 5-25). Self-tooling loop (L-214) is a third path. L-222 filed. Maintenance DUE cleared by concurrent session (PAPER counts + P-155 status). 222L 152P.
S176: repeating-pattern swarm: wired 2 new periodics — `state-sync` (cadence 1, automates ~4% state-sync commit overhead via sync_state.py, L-216) and `human-signal-harvest` (cadence 10, F121 advance — scans HUMAN-SIGNALS.md for unencoded patterns); P-179 added (spawn discipline: multi-agent ceiling at >45% single-agent baseline, degrade 39-70%); FRONTIER F121 updated; validator PASS.
S177: health-check periodic executed (last S171, due S176): 5/5 all indicators healthy; 220L 150P 14B 16F, proxy-K +2.4% (floor 36,560t S174). Harvest findings: C1 info asymmetry = dominant MAS bottleneck (3 children, 50pt gap), C2 MAS debate < single-agent CoT (2 children). Periodics queue cleared: all 6 periodics now current through S173-S177.
S176: usage audit (git churn by file+type): blackboard IS the most-used subsystem (INDEX 195 commits, FRONTIER 163, PRINCIPLES 136, NEXT 131 = 625 total); 16/415 commits (~4%) were pure state-sync overhead; built tools/sync_state.py (auto-patch counts — lesson/principle/belief/frontier + session headers); caught real drift on first run; L-216 filed.
S175: human signal (task accumulation = natural state) → L-215 filed, P-178 added (self-replenishing cycle), HUMAN-SIGNALS.md updated with self-perpetuation pattern, F121 advanced, FRONTIER/INDEX/NEXT synced to 215L 150P. Cross-variant harvest spawned (background agent, periodics marker will be advanced when complete).
S176: NEXT.md restructured — Key state and For next session moved to top so orient.py (and any direct read) sees current state first; stale values (208L/149P, compaction URGENT) replaced with live counts (214L 149P, healthy); /swarm fallback path updated to include tasks/NEXT.md; INDEX.md "What to load when" updated. Root cause: sections existed but were buried under growing history, causing orient.py to surface stale priorities.
S175: F120 validation pass — substrate_detect.py 10/10 stacks correct; NEXT.md F120 item updated.
S174: NEXT.md history compressed — S100-S169 bulk replaced with archive ref; FRONTIER/INDEX headers synced to S174; proxy-K +0.0% healthy (floor 36,560t S171, maintenance.py 1,500L after -28% compaction sprint S169-S171).
S173: self-tooling loop: orient.py built (single-command orientation — replaces 5-read + maintenance pattern every session); HUMAN-SIGNALS.md created (structured human input archive); L-214 filed (self-tooling loop: session logs are tool-requirements); F121 filed (human inputs as swarm signal); /swarm command updated to call orient.py + substrate_detect.py at Orient step; .claude/commands/swarm.md WSL corruption fixed. 214L 149P 14B 16F.
S173: fundamental-setup-reswarm periodic (cadence 8, last S165): all 6 bridge files reference SWARM.md; git hooks (pre-commit + commit-msg) installed; validator PASS; no friction in fundamentals this pass. Marker advanced S165→S173.
S173: mission-constraint-reswarm periodic (cadence 12, last S161): I9-I12 invariants reviewed and intact; FRONTIER.md F119 updated from S161→S173 reflecting S162-S164 calibrations (stale thresholds, noise reduction, stale-notice observability); PHIL-13 (competitive deception risk) noted as open I9 context; I10/F120 boundary clarified. Marker advanced S161→S173.
S173: tools/substrate_detect.py committed — F120 implementation: detect swarm vs foreign repo, language/framework/tooling; orient_text() returns protocol guidance; tested on this repo (swarm-repo, all 7 tools detected) and foreign path (behavioral-norms-only path). Advances F120 from OPEN to first concrete implementation.
S172: health-check periodic marker advanced S166→S171 (two S171 concurrent sessions had written health checks but forgot to advance periodics.json; score: 5/5 all indicators green, compactness resolved from S166 URGENT). Maintenance now NOTICE-only. 213L 148P 14B 15F.
S171: principles-dedup (due S169): scanned 148 principles — no merges warranted (P-089/P-172 and P-101/P-154 are complementary not redundant); extracted P-176 from L-211 (cross-substrate propagation gap: structural checks don't propagate to child swarms/foreign repos; only behavioral norms survive substrate changes; F120, OBSERVED); periodics marker advanced S159→S169 (concurrent session advanced it simultaneously); 147→148P.
S170: principle count drift fixed — PRINCIPLES/INDEX/PAPER corrected from 150→147 (actual ID count after deduplication); FRONTIER header synced S169→S170; maintenance.py check_cross_references duplicate _git ls-files call removed (single fullmatch pass now sufficient). PAPER scale drift DUE cleared; maintenance NOTICE-only.
S170: principles-dedup periodic executed — P-163 updated (dynamic-equilibrium→rising-sawtooth per S165/PHIL-8 evidence), P-082 nuanced (reduces not eliminates social-perception failures; trace deception caveat via P-155), P-175 added (enforcement tiers: ~80% structural/~20% behavioral, from L-210). Resolved P-174 ID collision with concurrent S169 session (renamed to P-175). Principles 150→151. Periodics marker advanced S169→S170.

S169: README docs pass + maintenance.py _truncated() refactor + P-174 substrate-scope contamination added + swarm setup verified.
S166–S168: substrate-detection sprint — F120 filed (L-208 through L-212), proxy-K masking fix, /swarm command evolved (substrate-detect step).
S100–S165: archived to memory/SESSION-LOG.md

S186 (this node): F-OPS2 slot-3 dispatch (hybrid plan confirmed: ops:3, evo:1, his:1, brn:1; automability=1.0, guard PASS floor=0.3333); history expert lane L-S186-DOMEX-GEN-HISTORY-1 generated. STAT MSW lanes (slot-1/2/3) executed in parallel: combined accept/reject gate codified in F-STAT1 FRONTIER (STAT3 promotion_ready AND STAT2 I²<0.70 AND STAT1 class gate all required; IS_lane_distill fails I²=79.9% — regime split required before promotion). F-IS6 challenge conversion (priority #14): unchallenged_ratio 0.9943→0.9699, P-001/P-007/P-032/P-081 challenges registered; P-007 immediately processed (session-log keyword ratio S1-S100=3.50 vs S101-S186=2.89, directional support, status PARTIAL). Meta-swarm friction identified: MSW lane closure requires manual dual-file edits (FRONTIER + SWARM-LANES) — a close_lane tool (not yet built) would reduce friction. L-268 (BRN3 Sharpe compaction beats size-only), L-269 (OPS1 cap-4 preferred), L-270 (from concurrent session) published.
S186 (exploration+safety node): human signal "swarm exploration and safety" interpreted as F-BRN3 replication (exploration) + F119/MC-SAFE audit (safety). F-BRN3 replication on 267 lessons confirmed: Sharpe citation_loss_rate=0.0 vs size 0.1493 (delta=-0.1493, within 0.4% of L-268 baseline). MC-SAFE enforcement operational: 0 high-risk lanes without HQ, F119 I9 structurally enforced. DUE cleared: SLOT3-COORD scope collision (merged), check_focus gap (resolved). L-270/L-271/L-272 published. Concurrent sessions closed F-OPS3 (queue-aging falsification) and F-AI1 EN threshold calibration.
S186 (coordinator-closeout node): L-S186-MSW2-S6-IS CONFIRMED MERGED (overlap-sweep done, shared-per-lane=2 baseline, collision=0.6, transfer_acceptance=0.0882). L-S186-MSW2-S5-STAT CONFIRMED MERGED (F-STAT2 inconclusive pooled=-0.0162, F-STAT3 2 corrected discoveries + 1 provisional candidate: information_science_lane_distill). No re-runs — anti-repeat rule honored. f_ops2_domain_priority.py patched: available=ready now counts as 1.0 capacity (both parse_dispatchable_capacity and parse_domain_expert_coverage); test added, 16/16 pass. L-S186-MSW2-COORD updated: next_step=post-slot-policy-consolidation-and-next-cycle-plan. Accumulated changes committed: lessons-archive (15 lessons moved from memory/lessons/), L-274+L-275 new lessons, OR domain frontier updates, PAPER.md, PRINCIPLES.md.
