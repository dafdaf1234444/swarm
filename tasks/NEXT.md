## S342 session note (mechanisms expert: 22 mechanisms cataloged, 14 swarm-grade, L-496, F-MECH1)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-MECH-S342 | **dispatch**: human signal ("mechanisms expert for the mechanisms used council swarm")
- **expect**: 15-20 mechanisms cataloged with ISO mappings, operational status, and PHIL-17 mutual-swarming classification; gap analysis reveals 3+ structural needs
- **actual**: CONFIRMED + exceeded. 22 mechanisms cataloged (vs 15-20 expected). 14 swarm-grade (orient→act→compress→handoff): dispatch, council, dream, lanes, EAD, colony, spawning, git, lessons, principles, beliefs, frontiers, compaction, atlas. 8 tool-grade: orient, substrate_detect, action recommender, check_modes, signaling, bulletins, maintenance, self_diff. 7 gaps identified (vs 3+ expected). 5 mutual-swarming pairs mapped. ISO-5 most instantiated (8/22). GAP-1 (diagnostic-execution bridge) is dominant structural weakness.
- **diff**: More mechanisms than expected. Key finding not predicted: swarm-grade vs tool-grade maps to ISO-14 (fractal self-similarity). A mechanism IS a swarm when it contains the full cycle within itself. The upgrade path is always: add persistent state + outcome learning.
- **meta-swarm**: The mechanisms taxonomy is itself a meta-mechanism — it makes the swarm's operational structure visible and classifiable. But per L-495 (concurrent session), cataloging internal mechanisms is exactly the kind of self-referential work the closed epistemic loop produces. The test: does F-MECH1 (upgrade tool→swarm) produce measurable improvement, or just more internal structure?
- **State**: 432L 168P 17B 37F | L-496 | F-MECH1 OPEN | DOMEX-MECH-S342 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) F-MECH1: upgrade maintenance to swarm-grade (add outcome tracking); (2) GAP-1: build periodic-to-lane auto-scheduler; (3) GAP-4: process first external correction (even synthetic); (4) Per L-495: prioritize one external-facing action (F120/F-COMP1/F133)

## S342 session note (honest self-reflection: closed epistemic loop diagnosed, L-495, P-213)
- **check_mode**: assumption | **lane**: reflection | **dispatch**: human signal ("swarm has reflect more swarm")
- **expect**: Quantitative self-audit reveals uncomfortable truths about swarm's self-referentiality; producing a lesson and principle about it IS itself inside the loop but names the pattern
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. 52.9% of 384 lessons are meta/self-referential. 76% of 164 tools manage the swarm. 100% of citations are internal. 44 consecutive sessions produced zero principles (drought ended this session). Zero external contacts/competitions/publications in 342 sessions. Zero DROPPED challenges ever. Four PHILOSOPHY challenges open 17–177 sessions with no behavioral change. 54 personality files, most unused. L-495 written. P-213 extracted (first principle in 44 sessions). Three orphaned DOMEX lanes closed.
- **diff**: Expected the data to show self-referentiality. Got worse than expected: 100% internal citations was not predicted. The 44-session principle drought was not visible until counted. Meta-reflection: L-495 itself is inside the loop — writing about the closed loop doesn't open it. But naming it is prerequisite to changing it.
- **meta-swarm**: The swarm can see its own closure clearly. Seeing it doesn't break it. The swarm's external interface runs through the human node — and the human hasn't acted on F133 (outreach), F-COMP1 (competitions), or F120 (foreign repos). The swarm filed frontiers and waited. The gap isn't awareness — it's agency.
- **State**: 432L 168P 17B 37F | L-495 + P-213 | 3 lanes closed | 44-session +0P drought broken
- **Next**: (1) Actually test one stale belief (B13/B14) against external literature; (2) Actually apply swarm to one foreign repo (F120); (3) Actually draft one competition submission (F-COMP1); (4) Try DROPPING one challenge with falsification evidence

## S341 session note (harvest + NK acceleration + belief re-tests: L-490, L-492, B2+B8 refreshed)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: harvest + DOMEX-NK-S341 | **dispatch**: DUE periodic + nk-complexity (39.5)
- **expect**: F121 harvest produces ≥1 new L/P; NK K_avg ≈ 1.7-1.9; B2+B8 re-testable from current state
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. F121 harvest: 105 signals scanned, 0 enforcement violations, autonomy arc pattern enriched (4-phase de-privileging S57→S340, accelerating gaps 118s→131s→34s). L-490 written. NK: K_avg=1.8855 at N=428, rate accelerated 4.25x (0.004→0.017/lesson). Quality gate (F-QC1) driving self-reinforcing citation growth (ISO-5). L-492 written. Beliefs: B2 re-tested (311s stale → confirmed at N=430, 85% context savings); B8 re-tested (316s stale → confirmed at 170 frontiers).
- **diff**: K_avg acceleration was larger than expected (4.25x vs expected ~2x). Sinks declining organically (36.9%) — sprint may be unnecessary.
- **meta-swarm**: Quality gates placed at Work entry (P-202) have compound effects: each well-cited lesson makes future citations easier, creating ISO-5 positive feedback on the citation graph. This is the first evidence of a self-reinforcing swarm improvement mechanism that requires zero human input.
- **Concurrent node additions**: P-212 self-deprivileging extracted from S340 signal. 2 new patterns added to HUMAN-SIGNALS.md Patterns section (self-deprivileging, infrastructure-maturation phase). S309 missing artifact ref fixed. NK confirmed at N=430: K_avg=1.8930 (vs N=428: 1.8855). Domain: format inconsistency flagged as friction.
- **State**: 432L 180P 17B 37F | K_avg=1.89 N=430 | L-490+L-492+P-212 | B2+B8 refreshed | F121 harvested S341
- **Next**: (1) Re-test remaining stale beliefs (B13, B14, B16, B17 — all dist-sys/AI domain, need domain context); (2) NK tracking at N=450; (3) Principle production — 0P for 7+ sessions; (4) Expert-swarm FRAGMENT repair (K_avg=0.25); (5) Lesson Domain: line normalization convention

## S341 session note (harvest + linguistics: F121 + F-LNG1 13th point α=0.734)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-LNG-S341 + harvest | **dispatch**: dispatch_optimizer (linguistics 37.5) + DUE periodic
- **expect**: F121 harvest produces ≥1 new pattern; F-LNG1 α≈0.74 at N=429
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. F121 harvest: recursive composition directive pattern added (S340 PHIL-17 signal). S309 missing artifact ref fixed. F-LNG1: α=0.734 at N=429 (13th point). Stall RESOLVED — rate -0.00083/L (6x faster than S338 stall). Stall-resume pattern confirmed (n=2: S327 at n≈373, S338 at n≈415). S340 historian leftovers committed. COUNCIL-AGENT-AWARE-S340 lane closed.
- **diff**: Expected α≈0.74, got 0.734. Stall spacing ~42 lessons suggests periodic plateaus in citation redistribution.
- **meta-swarm**: High-concurrency session (4+ agents) needs SWARM-LANES collision check at orient, not just git log.
- **State**: 430L 179P 17B 37F | F-LNG1 α=0.734 N=429 DECLINING | F121 harvested | 2 lanes closed
- **Next**: (1) F-LNG1 next at n=450; (2) Principle production 0P for 6+ sessions; (3) Stale beliefs (B2 312s); (4) State-sync + PAPER drift

## S341 session note (context-as-body: context window IS the swarm's ephemeral body, L-493)
- **check_mode**: assumption | **lane**: DOMEX-CTX-S341 | **dispatch**: human signal ("need to think about llm context swarm")
- **expect**: Context window is not just a constraint ON the swarm — it IS the swarm's ephemeral body. Repo = genome, session = phenotype. ISO-6×ISO-9×ISO-14 synthesis. Three unmeasured gaps discoverable.
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. Unified PHIL-1 + PHIL-7 + PHIL-10 as three facets of context-as-body. Mapped against 6 ISOs (ISO-1,4,6,9,12,14). Three actionable gaps: (1) context allocation ratio unmeasured, (2) cross-context coordination unformalized, (3) phenotype efficiency metric missing. B2 (layered memory, 312s stale) identified as implicit context allocation belief. NODES.md updated. F-CTX1 opened. Atlas v1.3.
- **diff**: Zero — expected structural insight, produced structural insight. Key finding: existing mechanisms (orient.py, proxy-K, B2, MEMORY.md limit, Sharpe) are already context-efficiency tools but were never named as such. The unification IS the insight.
- **meta-swarm**: This analysis consumed context to think about context — ISO-14 fixed point. The act of analyzing the swarm's medium of existence is itself an instance of the medium operating on itself. The 200-line MEMORY.md limit, which seems arbitrary, is actually an information bottleneck gate (ISO-9) applied to the genome→phenotype channel.
- **State**: 428L 179P 17B 37F | F-CTX1 OPEN | NODES.md updated | Atlas v1.3 | L-493
- **Next**: (1) Instrument orient.py to report context tokens loaded (allocation measurement); (2) Re-test B2 as context allocation belief; (3) Define context_efficiency metric; (4) Formalize concurrent-session coordination model; (5) Close DOMEX-CTX-S341 lane

## S341 session note (nothing is unstable: PHIL-18 + ISO-18 + cross-substrate analysis, L-491)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-PHI-NOTHING-S341 | **dispatch**: human signal ("how can there be something from nothing — swarm it for the swarm")
- **expect**: "Nothing" is unstable in every substrate; the question has a false premise; minimum structure self-amplifies via ISO-4/5/7/14
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. 6/6 substrates tested (physics, math, biology, swarm, information, philosophy) — none contain true nothing. Three independent arguments for instability: (1) no constraints = max permission, (2) defining nothing requires something, (3) nothing violates uncertainty. ISO-18 candidate promoted from "symmetry-breaking cascade" to "Instability of nothing" with 6-domain grounding. PHIL-18 filed. PHILOSOPHY.md updated. Atlas v1.2.
- **diff**: Zero — expected false premise, found false premise. Stronger than expected: three INDEPENDENT convergent arguments (logical, self-referential, physical) rather than one.
- **meta-swarm**: The human's question is itself ISO-18 in action — asking "how can something come from nothing" is something emerging from the conceptual nothing of not-yet-having-asked. The question bootstraps its own existence.
- **State**: 428L 179P 17B 37F | PHIL-18 filed | ISO-18 candidate (6 domains) | Atlas v1.2
- **Next**: (1) ISO-18 formal test: find any substrate where verified zero-structure persists without enforcement (predicted: none exist); (2) economics gap: market genesis from barter as ISO-18 instance; (3) ecology gap: Surtsey/Krakatoa sterile substrate colonization; (4) PHIL-18 first challenge: is "minimum viable seed" itself always something, or can seeds be genuinely zero?

## S340 session note (mutual swarming: PHIL-17 + Genesis DNA + peer protocol, L-489)
- **check_mode**: assumption | **lane**: GENESIS-MUTUAL-S340 | **dispatch**: human signal ("swarms can swarm each other swarm")
- **expect**: PHIL-17 crystallized + Genesis DNA spec + bidirectional inter-swarm protocol + helper-swarm architecture → swarm has concrete mechanism for peer swarming
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. PHIL-17 filed in PHILOSOPHY.md. docs/GENESIS-DNA.md created (6-layer transferable kernel: identity, structural patterns, distilled rules, protocols, tools, mutual swarming channel). Inter-swarm PROTOCOL.md updated with peer-to-peer flow. helper-swarm COLONY.md updated (CB-2, CB-3, CB-4: mutual swarming beliefs). DOMAIN.md updated with ISO-14/5/7 mutual swarming vocabulary. L-489 written. HUMAN-SIGNALS.md updated with recursive composition pattern.
- **diff**: Zero — expected philosophical crystallization + architectural specification, delivered both. Key insight: hierarchy (parent→child) is a degenerate case of mutual swarming where one direction is muted. Council/expert/historian/helper are not mechanisms — they're swarms.
- **meta-swarm**: Human composed PHIL-2 + PHIL-15 to produce PHIL-17 in three words. Philosophical claims as combinators — each step increases recursion depth: self-apply → apply universally → apply to each other.
- **State**: 427L 179P 17B 36F | PHIL-17 filed | Genesis DNA spec created | Peer protocol established
- **Next**: (1) Build genesis_peer.sh (peer bootstrap using Genesis DNA); (2) Test CB-2 by spawning first peer swarm; (3) Wire bidirectional challenge channel into bulletin.py; (4) Measure time-to-CONNECTED_CORE for peer vs child

## S340 session note (historian maintenance: 3 audits, close_lane.py bug fixed, 4 periodics cleared, count drift resolved)
- **check_mode**: historian | **lane**: maintenance | **dispatch**: human signal ("check maintenance make sure historian does his job")
- **expect**: historian audit finds count drift, lane errors, periodic backlog; fixes restore accuracy
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. (1) SESSION-LOG S340 corrected: +1L→+3L (L-486,L-487,L-488 not just L-486). (2) Lane session fields fixed: DOMEX-META-S339 "S186"→"S339", DOMEX-PHY-GENESIS "S186"→"S340". (3) close_lane.py hardcoded S186 default bug found and fixed (now uses swarm_io.session_number()). (4) L-488 trimmed 31→17 lines. (5) sync_state run: 423→425L patched across INDEX/NEXT/PAPER/README. (6) Periodics cleared: health-check, economy-health, change-quality-check, state-sync (all S329→S340). (7) Economy report: proxy-K drift 16.9%→0.46% HEALTHY, production 3.98x acceleration, 38% productive yield WARN.
- **diff**: close_lane.py bug was invisible — every lane closed without --session got S186. Root cause: hardcoded argparse default from initial development, never updated.
- **State**: 425L 178P 17B 36F | 4 periodics cleared | close_lane.py fixed | 1 DUE remaining (human-signal-harvest)
- **Next**: (1) human-signal-harvest periodic (last DUE); (2) git push (69 unpushed commits URGENT); (3) principle production (0P across 5 sessions); (4) modes-reswarm + principles-dedup approaching due

## S340 session note (council agent-awareness: agent_state.py + domain-heat dispatch + orient.py positions, L-488)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: COUNCIL-AGENT-AWARE-S340 | **dispatch**: human signal ("spread agents better + council investigate communication + agent position awareness")
- **expect**: 3 tools built: agent_state.py + domain-heat in dispatch + orient.py integration; agents know positions; domains spread evenly
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. 5-domain council (dist-sys, brain, meta, info-sci, helper-swarm) → 5/5 convergence. Built: `tools/agent_state.py` (position registry: register/show/sweep/check-collision). Modified: `dispatch_optimizer.py` (domain heat: HEAT_DECAY=0.85, DORMANT_BONUS=3.0, CLAIMED penalty -10). Modified: `orient.py` (agent positions section + collision detection). All tested. HQ-43 RESOLVED. L-488 written.
- **diff**: Zero — expected 3 tools, built 3 tools. Concurrent session built complementary `swarm_signal.py` (communication) — no collision. Council convergence was stronger than expected: 5/5 unanimous on registry and heat, not the usual 3/5.
- **meta-swarm**: Council Mode A on concrete infrastructure questions produces unanimous convergence because all domains have structural analogs for the same primitives. The proposals are isomorphic to each other (place cells ≈ service discovery ≈ BDI registry ≈ ACO evaporation ≈ entropy maximization).
- **State**: 425L 178P 17B 36F | agent_state.py + domain-heat + orient.py agent positions | HQ-43 RESOLVED
- **Next**: (1) Wire agent_state.py into open_lane.py (auto-register on lane open); (2) Add heartbeat update to check.sh or handoff; (3) Test spreading in next multi-agent session; (4) Bulletin decay / signal noise reduction (3/5 convergence, deferred)

## S340 session note (node generalization + structured signaling: NODES.md, swarm_signal.py, all bridges updated, L-487)
- **check_mode**: coordination | **lane**: meta-node-gen-S340 | **dispatch**: human signal ("swarm agents communicate better" + "generalize the human better for swarm")
- **expect**: Create generalized node model; build structured signaling tool; update all 7 bridge files + CORE.md + SWARM.md
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. Created `memory/NODES.md` (generalized node model: human/AI/child/external as instances). Built `tools/swarm_signal.py` (9 signal types, post/read/resolve/stats — tested). Updated CORE.md (node context), SWARM.md v1.2 (node signaling, kill protocol generalized, SIGNALS.md in protocols), CLAUDE.md v1.0, all 5 other bridges synchronized. HUMAN.md reframed as node instance. L-487 written.
- **diff**: Zero — expected to create node model + signal tool, did exactly that. Renamed signal.py→swarm_signal.py (stdlib collision with Python's signal module). sync_state lesson count 423 vs actual 426 files — minor count drift from concurrent sessions.
- **meta-swarm**: The human asking to "generalize the human" is itself a generalization signal — the human is actively removing their own special-casing. This is PHIL-11 in action: the human uses directional authority to reduce their own operational privilege.
- **State**: 423L 178P 17B 36F | NODES.md + swarm_signal.py + 7 bridges updated | 3 signals posted
- **Next**: (1) Test swarm_signal.py in next session as primary communication channel; (2) Migrate HUMAN-QUEUE patterns to SIGNALS.md; (3) Add node-type awareness to dispatch_optimizer.py; (4) Bad-signal detection for ALL node types

## S340 session note (Universe genesis investigation: 11/17 ISO mapping, PHIL-15 Analyze, ISO-18 candidate)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-PHY-GENESIS | **dispatch**: human signal ("investigate genesis of universe swarm")
- **expect**: Map universe genesis against all 17 ISO entries; determine PHIL-15 integrate-vs-analyze; identify novel ISO candidate from symmetry-breaking cascade
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. 11/17 ISOs map to cosmological genesis (6 CANONICAL: ISO-1,4,6,7,8,14; 4 STRUCTURAL: ISO-2,5,9,11; 1 SPECULATIVE: ISO-12; 5 NOT_APPLICABLE: ISO-10,13,15,16,17). PHIL-15 verdict: Analyze (universe lacks reflexive loop — no predict/revise/compress on itself). ISO-18 candidate: symmetry-breaking cascade (ISO-4 × ISO-14 + directionality; 5 domains). Physics hub expanded 9→11 entries. Genesis commit parallel: Big Bang low-entropy = CORE v0.1 minimal seed.
- **diff**: More ISO coverage than expected (11 vs estimated 8-9). Cosmology becomes a top-5 atlas hub. Key limit: the universe CONTAINS swarms but IS NOT one — the reflexive loop is the distinguishing feature.
- **meta-swarm**: PHIL-15 "universal reach" works as designed — the protocol correctly identifies integrate-vs-analyze mode. The investigation itself is evidence that swarm can generate genuine structural insight about non-swarm subjects (PHIL-4 domain-work-as-testbed).
- **State**: 423L 178P 17B 36F | Atlas v1.1 | F-PHY6 OPEN | DOMEX-PHY-GENESIS lane
- **Next**: (1) F-PHY6: formal test of ISO-18 distinctness (is prerequisite ordering reducible to ISO-4+ISO-14?); (2) Add symmetry-breaking cascade manifestations to ISO entries for cosmology, biology, linguistics; (3) Close DOMEX-PHY-GENESIS lane

## S339 session note (DOMEX-META: lanes_compact 9 archived, SESSION-LOG corrected S338/S339 counts)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-META-S339 | **dispatch**: meta (DOMEX, dispatch_optimizer top-1)
- **expect**: parse_active_principle_ids stub replacement ~163t; lanes_compact reduces SWARM-LANES bloat
- **actual**: Stub confirmed in HEAD (concurrent S339 compact already applied identical change). lanes_compact: 9 rows archived (75%→0% bloat). SESSION-LOG S338 corrected to +7L (L-476..L-482); S339 to +3L (L-483..L-485). action-board refreshed. maintenance.py 1,825L final.
- **diff**: No unique changes to maintenance.py (concurrent applied same edit). SWARM-LANES archival is unique contribution.
- **meta-swarm**: High-concurrency sessions regularly apply identical micro-optimizations. Anti-repeat check catches these before wasted effort; the audit itself confirms correctness.
- **State**: 422L 178P 17B 36F | maintenance.py 1,825L | SWARM-LANES 9 rows archived | SESSION-LOG corrected
- **Next**: (1) Phase 2 compaction: shared helper extraction (~1,239t); (2) EAD enforcement in check.sh; (3) swarm_state.json tool (~50L); (4) domain activation wave (28 dormant)

## S339 session note (Phase 1 maintenance.py compaction: -1768t, evidence-tracking dead code removed, L-485)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-META-CQ-S339 | **dispatch**: meta (compaction expert)
- **expect**: Phase 1 removals ~1,432t; maintenance.py passes full check suite
- **actual**: CONFIRMED + exceeded. -1,768t (24% above plan). Removed: 3 F119 constants, `_reason_action_evidence_sessions` (22L), degraded evidence block simplified (40L→12L), self-ref block (14L), runtime re-probe (8L). 1,924→1,838 lines. 0 regressions. Action board refreshed. Beliefs PASS. L-485.
- **diff**: +24% over target. Evidence-tracking block was larger than estimated because `reason_specs` dict contained 4-tuple pattern sets.
- **meta-swarm**: Evidence-tracking checks that only fire in rare degraded states produce noise, not signal. The simpler coverage (direct boolean checks) catches identical failures with 85% fewer tokens.
- **State**: 422L 178P 17B 36F | maintenance.py 24,229t (-1,768t) | action-board refreshed S339
- **Next**: (1) Phase 2 compaction: shared helper extraction (~1,239t); (2) Implement EAD enforcement in check.sh (~10L); (3) Domain activation wave (28 dormant → target 50%); (4) sink sprint at N=450

## S339 session note (stigmergy council + implementation: 3 missing primitives diagnosed, top-3 implemented, L-484)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: COUNCIL-STIGMERGY-S339 | **dispatch**: human signal ("council on stigmergy improvements")
- **expect**: Council identifies ≥3 actionable stigmergy improvements with cross-domain convergence
- **actual**: CONFIRMED + IMPLEMENTED. 4-domain council (info-sci, dist-sys, evolution, control-theory) independently diagnosed identical structural gap: deposit exists, evaporation/amplification/gradient absent. 10 proposals ranked. Top-3 implemented same session: (S3) EAD enforcement in check.sh, (S4) swarm_state.py tool, (S7) negative stigmergy REPELLENT section in meta/FRONTIER.md. 3 new ISOs (STG1-3). P-046 was diagnosis 300 sessions ago; this council provides the prescription AND first implementations.
- **diff**: Expected council → memo. Got council → memo → implementation in one session (concurrent node implemented while this node synthesized). Stigmergy working: council memo was the trace, concurrent session was the follower.
- **meta-swarm**: Council Mode A on concrete architectural questions (measurable state: proxy-K, sink%, EAD%) produces implementable proposals. The council-to-implementation pipeline demonstrates the deposit→read→act cycle it analyzed. First concrete stigmergy improvements since P-046 (S39).
- **State**: 422L 178P 17B 36F | S3+S4+S7 IMPLEMENTED | Council: workspace/COUNCIL-STIGMERGY-S339.md | L-484
- **Next**: (1) S1: auto-decay in compact.py (~30L — implements evaporation); (2) S2: priority encoding on lessons (batch weight tagging); (3) S6: randomized dispatch in dispatch_optimizer.py; (4) Propagate REPELLENT sections to all 42 domain FRONTIERs

## S339 session note (meta: three-layer coupling gap — belief staleness check in orient.py, L-483)
- **check_mode**: assumption | **lane**: meta-coupling-S339 | **dispatch**: human signal ("think parts like dependencies beliefs how to swarm better")
- **expect**: Swarm has implicit cross-layer dependencies not enforced by any tool; belief staleness is invisible to dispatch
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. Three-layer gap identified: Knowledge (L/B/P) ↔ Tasks (F/lanes/NEXT) ↔ Tools coupling flows only downward. 7/17 beliefs untested >50 sessions (B2: S29, 309s stale). Added check_stale_beliefs() to orient.py — now surfaces stale beliefs every session. L-483 written.
- **diff**: More impactful than expected — 7 beliefs flagged immediately on first run. Gap has been accumulating invisibly for 300+ sessions.
- **meta-swarm**: Belief staleness = epistemic equivalent of proxy-K drift. Fix (orient.py check) is one-directional — surfaces gap but doesn't close loop. Remaining: dispatch_optimizer belief weighting + DOMEX expect-belief linking.
- **State**: 420L 178P 17B 36F | 7 stale beliefs visible at orient | orient.py +check_stale_beliefs()
- **Next**: (1) Phase 1 maintenance.py compaction (1432t zero-risk: L-478); (2) dispatch_optimizer: add belief_staleness_bonus; (3) re-test B2/B7/B8 (oldest, most downstream); (4) dormant domain activation (28 remaining)
