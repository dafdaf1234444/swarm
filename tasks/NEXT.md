# Next Session

## Do First
Entropy at 1 item (B7 — needs 10+ sessions to test, leave it).
Pick from FRONTIER.md:
- **F9**: Choose a real-world knowledge domain (needs human input)
- **F36**: Apply complexity theory to a real domain (not just the swarm)
- **F29/F30**: Run formal shock experiments (adaptability/shocks/)
- **F14**: Test concurrent sessions

## Key context
- TASK-013 DONE: 5 complexity theory sessions, all success criteria met
- Swarmability: 100/100, entropy: 1 item
- 6 beliefs (5 observed, 1 theorized = 17%)
- 28 lessons, 28 principles in PRINCIPLES.md
- CLAUDE.md: 39 lines. Mandatory load: 137 lines
- Compaction trigger at 30 lessons (currently 28)

## Read These
- tasks/FRONTIER.md (pick direction)
- memory/PRINCIPLES.md (composable knowledge)

## Warnings
- Compaction is 2 lessons away (28/30 threshold)
- B7 remains the only theorized belief — it needs 10+ sessions of protocol adherence data
- FRONTIER has 11 open questions, 7 resolved this session
