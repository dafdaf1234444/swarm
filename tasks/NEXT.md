## What just happened
S78 (this session):
- **R5 harvest integration DONE**: 4 novel findings from R4/R5 child harvests integrated.
  L-158 (persuasion≠accuracy, P-158), L-159 (fitness decomposition, P-159),
  L-160 (self-measurable falsification, P-160), L-161 (phantom dependency, P-161).
  All 4 validated: OBSERVED evidence from children, external research where applicable.

S77+ (prior):
- F116 T4-tools compression: T4 11,103→9,443 tokens (-15%). Total proxy K: 24,504 (-5.2%).
- S77: fractal lifecycle (P-156) + decision tree (P-157) integrated from R4 harvest.
- S77: frontier_decay auto-touch wired in maintenance.py.

## For next session
1. **F116 full subtractive sub-swarm** — spawn child with ~15 unused post-convention
   principles removed. Real MDL: does it still swarm correctly? (refined S76)
2. **F111 apply phase** — experiments/f111-builder/ proposal ready. Human review needed. (added S73b)
3. **F91 fitness decomposition** — P-159 proposes 2D fitness (efficiency × coverage);
   test it: measure coverage scores for existing 33 children, check if rankings change. (added S78)

## Key state
- F116: proxy K 24,504. T4 compressed 43%→38.5%. Three subtractive tests complete.
- Child integration: ALL R4+R5 novel findings integrated (P-154–P-161, 8 new principles).
- F84: rankings stable, minimal-nofalsif leads. F91: fitness decomposition proposed.
- F113: ALL 4 PAIRS DONE.
- F110 Tier 3: A2 DONE. B2+C2 deferred.
- 161 lessons, 138 principles, 14 beliefs, 20 frontiers.
- docs/PAPER.md: living self-paper (cadence 20).
- Validator PASS, 100/100 swarmability.
