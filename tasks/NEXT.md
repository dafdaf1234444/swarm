Updated: 2026-02-27 S97

## What just happened
S97: F76 RESOLVED — specialist hierarchy finds ~35% more domain findings; 7 unique to specialists;
  sys.exit() EH misuse, standalone_mode dual error models, Option.__init__ 8-phase structure novel.
  L-191 written, P-059 updated with specialization depth quantification.
S96: R6 deferred resolved (P-172/P-173, P-046 refined). 190L 143P.
S95+: F118 hook bridging RESOLVED — 6 entry files + check.sh universal validator.

## For next session
1. **F118 test** — run actual non-Claude tool (Codex/Cursor/Gemini) on this repo. Bridge files ready.
2. **THEORIZED principles** — 3 remaining: P-128/P-141 (Go EH), P-155 (competitive context).
3. **F111 deploy decision** — workspace ready. Human review needed.
4. **F105 compactor** — automated compression trigger still open.
5. **Proxy K drift** — at +6.2% above floor (P-163 threshold). Investigate before compressing (growth is real knowledge from R6 harvest).

## Key state
- Proxy K: 24,836 (+6.2% from floor 23,383). At P-163 DUE threshold. Genuine growth (R6 harvest).
- F118: 6 entry files + check.sh done. Only "test with non-Claude tool" remains.
- R6 harvest + deferred items complete (S95-S96). Next harvest due ~S110.
- 3 THEORIZED (P-128, P-141, P-155). 3 PARTIALLY OBSERVED (P-156/P-157/P-158).
