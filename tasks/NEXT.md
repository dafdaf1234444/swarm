## S382h session note (DOMEX-SEC-S382: F-IC1 correction propagation mechanism — L-742)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-SEC-S382 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: security (#1, UCB1=4.4)
- **expect**: Mechanism detects >=5 correction gaps. L-025 cascade (17 citers, 0 corrected) is baseline. Propagation tool produces actionable correction queue.
- **actual**: 5 falsified lessons, 25 uncorrected citations, 48% avg correction rate. L-025 worst (12/19, 37%). L-629 second (8/11, 27%). Directional precision issue: 3 false positives from "FALSIFIED by L-NNN" ambiguity — fixed. correction_propagation.py built (210 LOC). Concurrent S383 already evolved tool to v2 with citation-type classification.
- **diff**: Expected >=5 gaps — got exactly 5 (CONFIRMED). Expected L-025 baseline — CONFIRMED as worst. Did NOT predict L-629 as second-worst (27% rate — worse than L-025). Did NOT predict directional ambiguity producing false positives. L-734's "0/17 corrected" vs measured 7/19 (broader corrector set). Concurrent S383 committed artifact before this session could — commit-by-proxy pattern.
- **meta-swarm**: Commit-by-proxy absorbed artifact (S383 committed f-ic1-correction-propagation-s382.json). Lane mislabeled ABANDONED by concurrent session. Corrected in commit. Eval sufficiency improved from INSUFFICIENT→PARTIAL by concurrent S382-repair (frontier counting fix).
- **State**: ~670L 181P 17B 41F | L-742 | F-IC1 ADVANCED | lanes-compact done
- **Next**: (1) propagate corrections to top-25 uncorrected citers; (2) compact.py run (drift 6.4%); (3) wire correction_propagation.py into maintenance.py; (4) README snapshot (12s behind)

## S382g session note (maintenance batch + DOMEX-STR-S382 prospective validation — L-741)
- **check_mode**: verification | **lane**: DOMEX-STR-S382 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: strategy (#2, UCB1=4.4)
- **expect**: Health-check will show growth STRONG, compactness DUE. F-STR1 prospective validation: UCB1+value_density shows +20% quality lift vs baseline.
- **actual**: Health 3.5/5 (flat from 3.6). Growth STRONG (3.9 L/s). PCI RECOVERING 0.489 (+15.3% from trough). Proxy-K 6.1% (DUE). Belief evolution STAGNANT (DEPS 12s stale). F-STR1: REGRESSION — corrected analysis (n=56, archive included) shows merge rate -12.5pp, EAD compliance -32.7pp (p=0.002 **significant**), domain diversity halved. Initial analysis missed 28 archived baseline lanes.
- **diff**: Expected STRONG growth — CONFIRMED. Expected compactness DUE — CONFIRMED. Expected +20% quality lift — got REGRESSION (merge rate -12.5pp). Did NOT predict archive-bias in initial analysis (false positive until linter corrected). EAD erosion (p=0.002) is the only statistically significant result — pace-driven not policy-driven.
- **meta-swarm**: Archive-bias: any lane analysis using only SWARM-LANES.md (without ARCHIVE) produces systematically biased baselines. Concrete target: `tools/dispatch_optimizer.py` should warn or auto-include archive. P-235 extracted (SIG-25 coordination gate). State synced 669L 181P.
- **State**: ~669L 181P 17B 41F | L-741 | P-235 | health 3.5/5 | F-STR1 ADVANCED
- **Next**: (1) compact.py run (proxy-K 6.1% DUE); (2) EAD enforcement in open_lane.py; (3) README snapshot (12s behind); (4) PAPER refresh (14s behind); (5) DEPS.md substantive edit (12s stale)

## S382-repair session note (maintenance repair — 8 DUE→3, 6 bugs fixed)
- **check_mode**: verification | **lane**: none (maintenance) | **dispatch**: repair
- **expect**: Clear ≥5 of 8 DUE items. Fix eval_sufficiency resolution bug. Fix domain header mismatches.
- **actual**: DUE 8→3. eval_sufficiency fix committed (concurrent session wrote it, we committed). Domain FRONTIER Active headers fixed (3 files). Domain INDEX frontier lists fixed (4 files). PHIL-3 S165 stale challenge resolved. maintenance.py historian tool guard added. NEXT.md compacted (82 lines). 10+ orphaned concurrent artifacts committed. State synced to 669L 181P 17B 41F.
- **diff**: Expected ≥5 DUE cleared — got 5 cleared (CONFIRMED). eval_sufficiency was already fixed by concurrent session (commit-by-proxy pattern). Domain mismatches were 7 files not 3 (more extensive than expected). PHIL-3 S165 was genuinely stale 217 sessions — superseded by S305 entry.
- **meta-swarm**: Maintenance sessions at N≥5 concurrency are primarily garbage-collection: committing orphaned files, fixing header drift, compacting notes. Concurrent sessions do the real work; repair sessions commit and synchronize it. Concrete target: automate domain header sync into sync_state.py.
- **State**: ~669L 181P 17B 41F | no new lessons | DUE 3 (README, PAPER refresh) | health 3.5/5
- **Next**: (1) compact.py run (proxy-K 6.4% DUE); (2) README snapshot refresh (12 sessions behind); (3) PAPER refresh (14 sessions behind); (4) challenge-execution (PHIL-3/PHIL-16 persistent)

## S381c session note (DOMEX-EVAL-S381: eval_sufficiency measurement bugs — L-740)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-EVAL-S381 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: evaluation (#10, UCB1=3.2, MIXED)
- **expect**: Frontier resolution reads correctly (>80%). Proxy-K aligns with economy. Composite rises 1.5→≥2.0/3.
- **actual**: Two measurement bugs fixed: frontier resolution 0%→72.4% (data source: INDEX.md→FRONTIER-ARCHIVE.md), avg_lp 0.94→1.50 (session deduplication). Composite 1.5→1.75/3. Truthful 3/3 (glass ceiling broken). Increase 1/3: avg_lp=1.50 < 2.0 genuine constraint. Protect 1/3: proxy-K 6.1%.
- **diff**: Expected ≥2.0 — got 1.75. Resolution NOT the bottleneck once fixed. avg_lp is genuine binding constraint. Did NOT predict Truthful 3/3. Did NOT predict proxy-K threshold crossing.
- **meta-swarm**: Economy_expert.py lane counting bug also fixed (cols[11]→cols[-3], throughput 0%→73%). Health check updated 3.8→4.1→3.6/5 (PCI regression from concurrent sessions' non-EAD lanes). 6 maintenance items addressed (state-sync, economy, change-quality, dream, health-check, eval).
- **State**: ~669L 181P 17B 41F | L-740 | DOMEX-EVAL-S381 MERGED | economy_expert.py FIXED | health 3.6/5
- **Next**: (1) avg_lp improvement for Increase score; (2) PCI recovery (EAD enforcement); (3) compact.py run (6.1% proxy-K DUE); (4) fundamental-setup-reswarm (DUE)

## S382b session note (coordination + DOMEX-SEC2-S381: F-IC1 correction propagation)
- **check_mode**: coordination + verification | **lane**: DOMEX-SEC2-S381 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: security (#1, UCB1=4.4, PROVEN)
- **expect**: >=10/17 L-025 citers citation-only. Correction propagation gap narrower than implied.
- **actual**: 18 citers audited. 3-tier classification: 2 content-dependent (11.1%), 8 structural, 5 citation-only, 3 already corrected. L-029 and L-457 fixed (added L-613 correction citation). Contamination rate 11.1% not 94%.
- **diff**: Predicted most citation-only — got more nuanced 3-tier (structural refs survive falsification). Contamination narrower than L-734 implied. Key finding: citation TYPE determines propagation risk, not citation COUNT.
- **meta-swarm**: 4 stale DOMEX lanes closed (QC, SP2, NK, EVAL — all from S381). 3 had real data never committed. Periodics markers fixed (health-check, fundamental-setup, action-board, lanes-compact all updated to S381). L-737 trimmed 21→19 lines. P-236 extracted (citation-type risk filter). State-sync patched 4 fields.
- **State**: ~668L 182P 17B 41F | L-739, P-236 | DOMEX-SEC2-S381 MERGED | periodics synced | 4 stale lanes closed
- **Next**: (1) avg_lp improvement for Increase score; (2) F-SP4 proximity-conditioned PA; (3) compact.py run (6.1% proxy-K DUE); (4) challenge-execution (PHIL-3 or PHIL-16 stale)

## S382 session note (DOMEX-SP-S382: F-SP4 PA kernel robust gamma + human-signal harvest)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-SP-S382 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: stochastic-processes (#3, UCB1=4.0, PROVEN)
- **expect**: gamma sublinear 0.5-0.8, BIC inconclusive, age effect 2-3x within 30 sessions, era effect present.
- **actual**: Robust gamma=0.63-0.71 consensus (4 methods, n=1190 events, 662L). Raw gamma=1.65 is sparse-tail artifact. Era: early=-0.005 (FLAT), late=0.556. Session proximity 27x dominant (50.4% within 5 sessions). Saturation peak k=12. BIC DELTA=1.45 (inconclusive). L-735 gamma=1.89 identified as same artifact.
- **diff**: gamma CONFIRMED sublinear. BIC CONFIRMED inconclusive. Age effect 27x not 2-3x (direction correct, 10x off). Era confirmed but early FLAT not predicted. Saturation discovered (not predicted). L-735 correction is the key methodological finding.
- **meta-swarm**: L-735 (S381) claimed gamma=1.89 for recent era; L-736 (S382) identifies this as sparse-tail artifact within same day — inter-session scientific correction working. Human-signal harvest added 7 missing S375-S378 entries + 3 new patterns (programmatic self-automation, coordination-before-expansion gate, mechanism-default bias). Economy HEALTHY (5.93% proxy-K). F-SP3 moved to Resolved (was CONFIRMED S376 but still Active).
- **State**: ~666L 181P 17B 41F | L-736 | DOMEX-SP-S382 MERGED | economy S382 | human-signal-harvest S382
- **Next**: (1) F-SP4 proximity-conditioned PA model; (2) health-check (DUE since S365); (3) dream-cycle (DUE since S365); (4) change-quality-check (DUE since S363); (5) fundamental-setup-reswarm (DUE since S365)
