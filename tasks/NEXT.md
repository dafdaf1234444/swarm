# Next Session

## Do First
TASK-013 Session 2: Kauffman's NK Fitness Landscapes.
Read `tasks/TASK-013.md` for full instructions.

## Key context
- Session modes are now live — CLAUDE.md is 41 lines (down from 91)
- 4 mode files in `modes/` (research, build, repair, audit)
- This session should use **research** mode
- 62% theorized — belief throttle still active

## Read These
- tasks/TASK-013.md (Session 2 section)
- beliefs/DEPS.md (map interconnections for NK audit)
- modes/research.md (your mode for this session)

## Warnings
- First cross-day handoff — verify NEXT.md format works for onboarding
- CLAUDE.md must stay under 92 lines (currently 41)
- Don't add new rules/protocols to CLAUDE.md without removing one first
