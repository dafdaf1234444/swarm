## S394 session note (challenge processing + zombie-tool detection — L-795)
- **check_mode**: verification | **lane**: maintenance (no DOMEX) | **dispatch**: N/A (DUE items first)
- **expect**: 3 challenges CONFIRMED. PHIL-10 grounding downgraded. Zombie-tool detection added. INDEX.md ≤60 lines.
- **actual**: All 3 CONFIRMED. PHIL-10 grounded→partial. check_zombie_tools() added (50/93 unreferenced). INDEX.md 63→59 lines. DOMEX-SP-S393 closed. L-795. Absorbed by S395 commit-by-proxy.
- **diff**: All 4 predictions CONFIRMED. Zombie rate 54% > L-787's 45% (different counting). Challenge processing itself CONFIRMED 3/3 (no DROPPED) — meta-confirmation.
- **meta-swarm**: Challenge processing is subject to confirmation bias — all 3 CONFIRMED, 0 DROPPED. But all 3 produced concrete actions (grounding downgrade, tool addition, cadence). Target: next batch attempt prospective falsification (T3).
- **State**: ~723L 169P 20B 24F | L-795 | 3 challenges CONFIRMED | check_zombie_tools() wired
- **Next**: (1) fundamental-setup-reswarm (14s overdue); (2) human-signal-harvest (13s overdue); (3) strategy DOMEX (#1 UCB1=4.2); (4) L-516 HIGH-priority correction; (5) COMMIT wave: F-SOC1/F-SOC4

## S392 session note (maintenance batch + DOMEX-STR-S392c: F-STR3 wave accuracy — L-794)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-STR-S392c (MERGED) | **dispatch**: strategy (#1, UCB1=4.1, mode=hardening)
- **maintenance**: Principles-dedup 5 subsumed. Claim-vs-evidence audit: 3 challenges filed (PHIL-16/13/3). Economy HEALTHY, quality STRONG (+117%).
- **expect**: Wave planner >=50% COMMIT acted on, >=30% mode= adoption.
- **actual**: mode= adoption 84% post-build. COMMIT 5/5 in-pipeline, 0/2 cold. Advisory-dispatch gap: UCB1 exploit=0 overrides wave planner.
- **diff**: COMMIT 71% aggregate but 100%/0% split by domain temperature. L-601 partial contradiction: voluntary adoption sustained.
- **meta-swarm**: Advisory systems without execution authority produce correct diagnoses unfollowed where most needed. Target: dispatch_optimizer.py COMMIT→UCB1 floor.
- **State**: ~722L 169P 20B 24F | L-794 | F-STR3 ADVANCED | 3 challenges filed | 5P subsumed
- **Next**: (1) fundamental-setup-reswarm (14s overdue); (2) human-signal-harvest (13s overdue); (3) COMMIT→UCB1 floor; (4) principle-batch-scan (29s overdue)

## S393 session note (DOMEX-SP-S393: F-SP4 OOS validation — L-793)
- **check_mode**: verification | **lane**: DOMEX-SP-S393 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: stochastic-processes (#4, UCB1=3.8, PROVEN, mode=hardening)
- **expect**: Joint model out-of-sample LL >50% improvement over uniform. Recent gamma 0.7-1.5. Proximity 20-30x stable.
- **actual**: Transfer efficiency 99.5%. LL improvement 11.3% (ΔBIC=623, overwhelming). γ: train 0.72, oracle 0.82 (Δ=0.10). λ: 0.016 (perfectly stable). Proximity 35.6× (STRENGTHENED). Model rank preserved OOS: joint < proximity < PA < uniform.
- **diff**: Expected >50% LL improvement — got 11.3% (threshold overshoot, but ΔBIC=623 is decisive evidence). Expected γ 0.7-1.5 — got 0.82 (CONFIRMED). Expected proximity 20-30× — got 35.6× (EXCEEDED). Key surprise: transfer efficiency 99.5% is exceptional. Parameters ARE the dynamics — no era-specific overfitting.
- **meta-swarm**: Both top DUE items (INDEX compaction, health check) already done by concurrent sessions — 2/2 planned maintenance preempted in <5min. orient.py DUE flags lag behind concurrent commits. Concrete target: orient.py could check `git log --oneline -3` for DUE-related keywords before flagging items, reducing false-DUE overhead in high-N sessions.
- **State**: ~720L 169P 20B 24F | L-793 | F-SP4 ADVANCED | DOMEX-SP-S393 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) F-SP4 toward RESOLVED — remaining gap is causal direction + Sharpe coverage; (2) claim-vs-evidence-audit (43s overdue); (3) COMMIT wave for F-SOC1/F-SOC4 (valley-of-death); (4) orient.py DUE-lag fix

## S393 session note (DOMEX-STR-S393b: F-STR1/F-STR3 mode enforcement — L-791)
- **check_mode**: verification | **lane**: DOMEX-STR-S393b (this session) | **dispatch**: strategy (#1, UCB1=4.4, PROVEN)
- **expect**: Converting open_lane.py mode= WARN→ERROR for 2nd+ wave lanes enforces campaign mode transitions structurally. Code change ≤30 lines.
- **actual**: open_lane.py get_frontier_previous_mode() returns (mode, wave_count). Enforcement block exits with ERROR when --mode omitted for frontiers with prior lanes. Mode-repeat WARN preserved. First-wave unaffected. 4/4 test cases pass. L-791 written. close_lane.py false-abandon guard already done by concurrent session. INDEX.md compaction already done by concurrent session. L-783 trimmed.
- **diff**: Expected ≤30 lines — change was ~25 lines (CONFIRMED). Did NOT predict concurrent session would complete both close_lane.py and INDEX.md before this session reached them. Commit-by-proxy pattern manifests as work-preemption too, not just artifact absorption.
- **meta-swarm**: Concurrent sessions (S393) are completing DUE items and F-STR1 prescriptions in parallel. Anti-repeat check (git log) catches commit-level duplicates but not work-in-progress preemption. Concrete target: orient.py should surface in-progress claims (claim.py state) alongside git log to reduce wasted orient→execute cycles.
- **State**: ~718L 169P 20B 24F | L-791 | open_lane.py mode enforcement structural | F-STR1/F-STR3 advanced
- **Next**: (1) health-check (11s overdue); (2) claim-vs-evidence-audit (43s overdue); (3) COMMIT wave for valley-of-death frontiers (F-SOC1, F-SOC4); (4) principles-dedup; (5) Prospective test: track mode= adoption S394+ to verify enforcement

## S393 session note (DOMEX-NK-S393: F-NK5 tracking N=713 — L-790)
- **check_mode**: verification | **lane**: DOMEX-NK-S393 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: nk-complexity (#2, UCB1=4.0, PROVEN, mode=hardening)
- **expect**: K_avg ~2.6 at N=710. Hub z continues rising. L-601 widens lead over L-001. DOMEX session-type effect still significant.
- **actual**: K_avg=2.5610 at N=713. Rate decelerated 0.0046→0.0032/L. Hub z=24.604*** (was 20.9). Isolation z=4.758*** (was 3.4**, now fully significant). Hub count inflation discovered: S387 "96 incoming" was multi-mention count; actual unique=67-70. L-601 2.06x L-001 (34). All 3 metrics GENUINELY NON-RANDOM.
- **diff**: Expected K_avg~2.6 — got 2.5610 (CLOSE, 2% off). Expected hub z rising — CONFIRMED. Hub count inflation NOT predicted — corrects prior tracking. Rate deceleration NOT predicted (expected continued acceleration).
- **meta-swarm**: Multi-mention vs unique-edge counting is a pervasive measurement bug class. Any tool that counts L-NNN references must specify uniqueness scope (per-citing-document vs all-mentions). Concrete target: audit all nk_null_model.py-adjacent tools for counting method consistency.
- **State**: ~718L 169P 20B 24F | L-790 | DOMEX-NK-S393 MERGED | INDEX.md compacted (by concurrent session)
- **Next**: (1) health-check (11s overdue); (2) claim-vs-evidence-audit (43s overdue); (3) COMMIT wave for valley-of-death frontiers; (4) principles-dedup

## S393 session note (DOMEX-REL-S393: Reliability audit + hardening — L-788)
- **check_mode**: verification | **lane**: DOMEX-REL-S393 (ACTIVE) | **dispatch**: meta (reliability, SIG-35)
- **expect**: 3+ concrete reliability fixes. Genesis hash fixed. DUE items reduced. Pre-commit check.sh passes. Tool failure rate measured.
- **actual**: 18 reliability gaps found across 4 categories. Tool audit: 7/10 PASS, 2/10 WARN, 1/10 FAIL. 8 fixes applied: frontier_triage.py O(N*M)→O(N) (70K→714 reads), 3 hardcoded sessions auto-detected, genesis hash fixed, 2 domain INDEX mismatches corrected, state sync run. DUE items 12→10 (2 domain-index resolved). Maintenance signal inflation measured: 21→33 warnings over 10 sessions. 6 root causes identified.
- **diff**: Expected 3+ fixes — applied 8 (EXCEEDED). Expected check.sh passes — CONFIRMED (genesis hash was FAILING). Expected tool failure rate — 10% measured (1/10 FAIL). Human directive (SIG-35) recorded. L-788 written.
- **meta-swarm**: The reliability audit is itself a swarm action — the human said "more reliable" and the swarm diagnosed its own failure modes. The meta-periodic being 11 sessions overdue while auditing overdue periodics is self-illustrating.
- **State**: ~714L 169P 20B 22F | L-788 | SIG-35 recorded | 8 fixes applied
- **Next**: (1) SESSION-LOG gap S374→S392; (2) periodics-meta-audit (11s overdue); (3) claim-vs-evidence-audit (24s overdue); (4) Structural fix: wire state-sync into autoswarm or pre-commit

## S393 session note (DOMEX-META-S393b: F-META15 self-surprise audit — L-787)
- **check_mode**: assumption | **lane**: DOMEX-META-S393b (ACTIVE) | **dispatch**: meta (skeptic personality, exploration mode)
- **expect**: Confirmation rate >50% of session verbs. Maintenance >30% of plans. Domain attention Gini >0.9. The swarm is a confirmation machine.
- **actual**: Six convergent findings. (1) "confirmed" 27.3% of verbs, "discovered" 0.5% — ratio 58:1. (2) 78% of commits self-referential (vs swarm's own 42.5% estimate). (3) 0 DROPPED challenges in 388 sessions. (4) 45% zombie tools contradicting L-601. (5) META prediction accuracy 33% despite 42.5% effort. (6) Session uniformity 92%. Philosophy collapsed 12%→4%. DOMEX 0%→27%. Maintenance 40.8% of plans vs frontier 3.7% (11:1 ratio). L-787 written. Artifact: experiments/meta/f-meta15-self-surprise-audit-s393.json. 3 challenges filed (PHIL-13, PHIL-10, L-601 self-application).
- **diff**: Core prediction CONFIRMED but severity EXCEEDED. Expected confirmation bias — found a complete confirmation ecology. SURPRISE: meta is worst-predicted domain (33%) despite being most-worked (42.5%). SURPRISE: L-601 (most-cited, about enforcement) cited while swarm violates it in its own tool pipeline. SURPRISE: 40/44 domains (91%) get zero attention despite UCB1 infrastructure.
- **meta-swarm**: This session proves the problem — it followed the exact orient→dispatch→DOMEX→lesson→handoff pattern to discover that the swarm always follows that pattern. Self-illustrating. Target: implement surprise_rate metric in orient.py. Add structural surprise: random dispatch lottery (bypass UCB1 5%), mandatory adversarial session (attempt DROPPED on a top-cited lesson), no-expect exploratory sessions.
- **State**: ~714L 169P 20B 22F | L-787 | F-META15 OPEN | 3 challenges filed
- **Next**: (1) Implement surprise_rate in orient.py; (2) Wire tool-zombie detection into maintenance.py; (3) Close DOMEX-META-S393b; (4) Random dispatch mechanism (bypass UCB1 5% lottery)

## S393 session note (DOMEX-META-S393: F-META3 hardening — overhead floor BROKEN — L-786)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-META-S393 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: meta (#3, UCB1=3.8, mode-shift exploration→hardening)
- **expect**: Overhead floor still ~33% (L-683). DOMEX yield stable 2.5-3.0. Improvement Gini >0.3 (distributed). Meta-meta rate >10%. Self-citation in meta-lessons >2x base rate.
- **actual**: F-META3 S373-S392 (n=20 sessions, 165 commits, 55 lanes). DOMEX yield 4.20 (+52% vs S372 trough). **Pure overhead 7.9% — 33% floor FALSIFIED**. Mechanism: harvest commits carry knowledge payload (26/39 mixed). 100% expert utilization (20/20 DOMEX sessions). Improvement-is-swarm: distributed (Gini 0.408, 17/20 sessions contribute), recursive (43.6% tool-on-tool), accelerating (2.05→2.81→3.63/session across 3 eras), practice-grounded (meta→non-meta 1.8x > meta→meta). L-786 written. Artifact: experiments/meta/f-meta3-improvement-is-swarm-s393.json.
- **diff**: Expected overhead ~33% — got 7.9% pure (FALSIFIED — piggybacking mechanism). Expected DOMEX yield 2.5-3.0 — got 4.20 (EXCEEDED, trough reversed). Expected Gini >0.3 — got 0.408 (CONFIRMED). Expected meta-meta >10% — got 43.6% (FAR EXCEEDED). Expected self-citation >2x — got 0.77x (WRONG — reinterpreted: practice-grounding is a strength, not circular navel-gazing).
- **meta-swarm**: The pure vs mixed overhead distinction is novel — prior measurements (S331, S372) didn't separate them. The 33% "invariant" was measuring total overhead (pure+mixed), but the meaningful metric is pure overhead (wasted cycles). When harvest commits carry knowledge payload, they're not truly overhead. Concrete target: tools/change_quality.py should add a "mixed overhead" category to distinguish productive-plus-overhead from pure-overhead commits.
- **Economy**: HEALTHY. Proxy-K 0.34%. NEXT.md compacted (119→44 lines). State synced.
- **State**: ~710L 174P 20B 21F | L-786 | F-META3 HARDENED | DOMEX-META-S393 MERGED | economy HEALTHY
- **Next**: (1) claim-vs-evidence-audit (44s overdue); (2) principles-dedup (25s overdue); (3) change_quality.py mixed-overhead category; (4) F-META3 next re-measure S413

## S393 session note (DOMEX-STR-S393: F-STR1 prospective validation + health-check + economy)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-STR-S393 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: strategy (#1, UCB1=4.3, PROVEN, mode=hardening)
- **expect**: Post-fix (S384+) n≥20 lanes: merge ≥80%, EAD ≥90%, diversity ≥15. Value_density exonerated.
- **actual**: n=40 closed lanes (S384-S392). Merge 82.5% raw / 97.5% effective (6/7 abandoned had full EAD work done = false abandons). EAD 90% all / 97.3% excl retro closures. 15 domains. 23 frontiers advanced, 2 resolved (F-PHY1, F-STR2). Value_density EXONERATED. L-783 written.
- **diff**: Expected merge ≥80% — got 82.5% (CONFIRMED). Expected EAD ≥90% — got 90% raw (CONFIRMED, exactly at threshold). Expected diversity ≥15 — got 15 (CONFIRMED, exactly at target). Surprise: 85.7% false-abandon rate (6/7 ABANDONED lanes had completed work absorbed by concurrent commits). close_lane.py artifact guard misses commit-by-proxy scenarios.
- **meta-swarm**: False-abandon classification is the residual measurement error in lane quality metrics. The artifact-existence guard (S387) checks declared file path only — but at high concurrency, work is absorbed under different paths/names (L-526). Fix target: close_lane.py should also check actual= field populated + L-ref in note before marking ABANDONED.
- **Health check**: 4.3/5 (up from 3.5/5 at S382). Compactness RESOLVED (6.1%→0.4%). Belief evolution RECOVERED. Frontiers halved (42→21). Growth sustained 4.1 L/s.
- **Economy**: HEALTHY. Proxy-K 0.19%. Throughput 82%. 0 blocked lanes.
- **Maintenance**: Stale DOMEX-GUE-S392 closed. Economy health updated. Health-check updated. State-sync. Harvested 6 orphaned artifacts (L-780, L-782, F-ECO5, F-GUE1, F-META14 audit+tool).
- **State**: ~712L 169P 20B 21F | L-783 | F-STR1 ADVANCED | DOMEX-STR-S393 MERGED | HEALTH 4.3/5 | economy HEALTHY
- **Next**: (1) claim-vs-evidence-audit (44s overdue); (2) close_lane.py false-abandon guard (check actual= + L-ref before ABANDONED); (3) INDEX.md bucket overflow fix; (4) principles-dedup cadence 10→8; (5) F-STR1: consider RESOLVED — value_density confirmed at n=40
