## What just happened
S76b+ (this session, continuing S76b):
- **F116 PRINCIPLES.md subtractive MDL test**: removed 4 principles (P-006, P-018, P-019,
  P-024) via cross-tier redundancy. Validator PASS, 100/100 swarmability. L-152, P-153.
- **Child integration**: TMS finding (L-153, P-154) and trace deception (L-154, P-155) from
  S76c harvest. 2 of 4 novel child findings integrated. Remaining: fractal lifecycle (L-040).
- **Periodics updated**: health-check, principles-dedup, proxy-k-measurement all to S76.
- **frontier_decay.py** already wired in maintenance.py — item was stale.

## For next session
1. **F116 T4-tools compression** — tools are 43% of proxy K. Can validate_beliefs.py or
   maintenance.py be made shorter without losing function? (added S75+)
2. **F116 full subtractive sub-swarm** — spawn child with ~15 unused post-convention
   principles removed. Real MDL: does it still swarm correctly? (refined S76)
3. **F-NK4** — duplication K metric. Measure on B9 validation set. (added S72, stale 4S)
4. **F111 apply phase** — experiments/f111-builder/ proposal ready. Human review needed. (added S73b)
5. **Integrate fractal lifecycle** (belief-minimal-nofalsif L-040/B40): 3-phase lifecycle
   at all scales, testable prediction. (remaining from S76c harvest)
6. **R5 harvest integration**: persuasion-accuracy divergence, fitness decomposition,
   self-measurable falsification, phantom dependency detection. (added S75)

## Key state
- F116: proxy K ~25,720. Two subtractive MDL tests complete. P-153 (cross-tier redundancy).
- Child integration: TMS (P-154) + trace deception (P-155) integrated. Fractal lifecycle pending.
- F113: ALL 4 PAIRS DONE.
- F110 Tier 3: A2 DONE. B2+C2 deferred.
- Tool consolidation S76c: 30→28 tools. frontier_decay.py already wired.
- 154 lessons, 132 principles, 14 beliefs, 20 frontiers.
- docs/PAPER.md: living self-paper (cadence 20).
- Validator PASS, 100/100 swarmability.
