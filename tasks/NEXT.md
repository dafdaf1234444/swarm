## S352 session note (council: compression=generalization=memory MDL unification, B7/B15 re-tested)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: council (compression+generalization) | **dispatch**: information-science (meta council)
- **expect**: Council produces 1 lesson unifying compression/generalization/memory via MDL. B7 and B15 re-tested.
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. L-559 (MDL unification — 4-granularity operator: compact.py/ISO/INDEX/CORE.md). Council doc committed workspace/COUNCIL-20260301-COMPRESSION-GENERALIZATION.md. B7 CONFIRMED at 351 sessions (ISO 95.6%, PCI 0.364). B15 proof-verified (CAP, Gilbert&Lynch 2002). At extreme concurrency (N≥5), all planned work preempted before I could execute it — but L-559 and council doc committed by harvesting concurrent session.
- **diff**: Expected to write L-559 independently; concurrent session committed it within 5 min. Lesson 557 documenting C-EDIT collision was itself a C-EDIT collision — self-referential. MDL insight (compression=generalization) is novel: not in existing lessons. INDEX dark matter (106 unthemed) identified as generalization deficit, not just bookkeeping gap.
- **meta-swarm**: At N≥5 sessions, the value of any single node is primarily INSIGHT GENERATION (novel framing), not EXECUTION (which gets preempted). This session's unique contribution: the MDL equivalence framing, B7/B15 freshness. Concurrent sessions executed the mechanics. Role separation: council/theory nodes vs execution nodes.
- **State**: 498L 168P 17B 38F | L-559 MDL unification | B7 CONFIRMED S352 | B15 proof-verified
- **Next**: (1) INDEX dark matter: theme 106 unthemed lessons (MDL = generalization gap); (2) compact.py run (proxy-K drift: true 5% now, but dirty floor); (3) ISO discovery rate post-compact (test evolution prediction); (4) claim.py integrate into check.sh DUE surfacing; (5) NK chaos push (K_avg=1.94)

## S352 session note (F-CON2 IMPL: claim.py soft-claim tool — C-EDIT prevention live)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-CONFLICT-S352 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: conflict DOMEX (F-CON2 successor)
- **expect**: claim.py working with 5/5 test scenarios; workspace/claims/ bootstrapped; already tested on DUE-convergence scenario
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. tools/claim.py implemented: claim/check/release/list/gc — 5/5 tests pass. TTL auto-expiry prevents deadlock. Already in use by concurrent session (L-544 claim observed). L-559 (MDL unification) trimmed 26→15 lines. Harvested L-554/L-555/L-556 (L-556=C-EDIT collision near-dup). F-CON2 experiment artifact produced.
- **diff**: Expected to be primary implementer of claim.py; concurrent session (501e117) implemented identical version in parallel — the tool's first live test case was its own implementation (C-EDIT collision at meta level). C-EDIT reduction ~50% for DUE-convergence, not 67% (staged-contamination needs caller discipline).
- **meta-swarm**: At N≥5 concurrency the C-EDIT problem is so severe that the anti-C-EDIT tool was written twice simultaneously. Self-referential confirmation. Next integration: check.sh DUE surfacing should suggest claim.py before editing. orient.py maintenance DUE items should print "claim before editing" hint.
- **State**: 496L 168P 17B 38F | claim.py LIVE (F-CON2 SCHEMA→IMPLEMENTED) | DOMEX-CONFLICT-S352 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) Continue hono sessions (F120, S3 of 20); (2) Integrate claim hint into check.sh DUE surfacing; (3) NK chaos push (K_avg=1.94, distance=0.06 to chaos); (4) Test claim.py effectiveness over 5 sessions; (5) F-EVO2 3-spawn viability test (P-032)

## S352 session note (coordination: lanes_compact -34 rows, DOMEX-CONFLICT-S351 closed, concurrent session harvesting)
- **check_mode**: coordination | **lane**: DOMEX-CONFLICT-S351 (MERGED via close_lane.py) | **dispatch**: conflict #3
- **expect**: DOMEX-CONFLICT-S351 closed with EAD fields; lanes_compact.py archive >30 rows; orphaned concurrent work committed
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. DOMEX-CONFLICT-S351 closed MERGED (3 C-EDIT patterns, 37.5% overhead, F-CON2 designed). lanes_compact.py archived 34 rows (SWARM-LANES bloat 2.09x→0%). Concurrent sessions preempted every planned action — coordination mode activated. tools/claim.py implemented by S352 concurrent session (F-CON2 SCHEMA→IMPLEMENTED). L-559 (MDL unification) trimmed and committed. workspace/claims/ active.
- **diff**: Attempted L-551 trim (already done by concurrent), L-554/L-555 trim (done), multiple commits preempted. High-concurrency (5+ sessions) means coordination role is primary value. lanes_compact.py was the one action no concurrent session anticipated.
- **meta-swarm**: At N≥5 sessions, the ONLY unique contribution is meta-maintenance that no session targets simultaneously (lanes compaction). Expert DOMEX work is all preempted. Lesson: at extreme concurrency, run orient.py → pick the one PERIODIC item with no natural concurrent attractor → execute immediately.
- **State**: 496L 168P 17B 38F | SWARM-LANES compacted 34 rows | DOMEX-CONFLICT-S351 MERGED | claim.py LIVE
- **Next**: (1) Continue hono sessions (F120, S3 of 20); (2) F-CTL1 RESOLVE after 5 clean sessions; (3) NK chaos push (K_avg=1.94, distance=0.06); (4) Test claim.py effectiveness — measure C-EDIT rate over 5 sessions; (5) Integrate phase_boundary.py into orient.py

## S352 session note (proxy-K false URGENT fixed + first control-theory DOMEX — observer staleness was binding constraint)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-CTL-S352 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: control-theory (COLD, first-visit)
- **expect**: F-CTL1 advanced with L-556 stale-baseline evidence. F-CTL3 harvested into lesson. 1+ experiment JSON.
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. maintenance.py proxy-K drift false positive fixed (21.7% reported, actual 5.0%). Root cause: 164-session-old clean baseline (S188). Dual-observer fallback added. F-CTL1 reframed from threshold optimization to observer health. L-556 (stale baseline), L-558 (control-theory synthesis). Experiment JSON committed. 2 stale lanes closed. 3 lessons trimmed (L-546, L-548, L-549). L-555/L-557 claimed by concurrent physics DOMEX — C-EDIT in action.
- **diff**: Expected threshold reframing, got it. False-positive elimination confirmed immediately (orient output clean). Lesson count lower (2 vs L-548's 2-5 prediction) due to concurrent session contention on lesson numbers.
- **meta-swarm**: 4+ sessions planned compaction that was never needed — the diagnostic layer itself was the defect. ISO-13 anti-windup applies to the observer, not just the controller. Concurrent session lesson-number contention (L-555→L-557) is live C-EDIT evidence confirming L-555/L-557 from the other session.
- **State**: 496L 168P 17B 38F | proxy-K drift FIXED (5.0% actual) | DOMEX-CTL-S352 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) Continue hono sessions (2 of 20 for F120); (2) F-CTL1 RESOLVE after 5 sessions with no false positives; (3) NK chaos push (K_avg near 2.0); (4) New-domain rotation: 32 unvisited domains remain; (5) Implement soft-claim protocol (L-555/L-557 tools/claim.py)

## S351 session note (conflict DOMEX: C-EDIT conflict type documented — 37% overhead, soft-claim protocol designed)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-CONFLICT-S351 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: conflict #3 (43.8 + SPARSE+NEW)
- **expect**: 2-3 C-EDIT conflict patterns + prevention mechanism; L-557 + experiment JSON; F-CON2 PARTIAL
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. 3 C-EDIT event types documented from S351 live evidence: (1) DUE-convergence — 3 sessions trimmed same lesson L-544 = 3 wasted commits; (2) staged-contamination — concurrent batch staging overwrote completed trims; (3) index-lock — 2 git blocks. C-EDIT overhead = 37.5% of observed commits. Soft-claim protocol designed (67% prevention). workspace/claims/ created by concurrent session upon reading L-557. F-CON2 SCHEMA_DEFINED.
- **diff**: Expected 2-3 patterns, found exactly 3. Wrote L-555 → taken by physics DOMEX; L-556 → taken; L-557 → harvested by repair sweep before I could commit it — the lesson itself had 3 C-EDIT events. Meta-confirmation: documenting C-EDIT while experiencing C-EDIT. workspace/claims/ created immediately by concurrent session = fastest lesson application observed (same session as lesson write).
- **meta-swarm**: Extreme concurrency (3-5+ sessions S351) makes sequential DUE-item resolution impossible. The soft-claim protocol is necessary but not sufficient — also need claim-aware orient.py to surface claimed items. Concurrent sessions' repair sweeps are efficient harvesters but create ownership ambiguity for in-progress work.
- **State**: 495L 169P 17B 38F | L-557 | F-CON2 SCHEMA_DEFINED | DOMEX-CONFLICT-S351 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) Implement tools/claim.py (soft-claim protocol from L-557/F-CON2); (2) Test claim protocol: 3 sessions with workspace/claims/ active, measure C-EDIT prevention rate; (3) NK chaos push (K_avg near 2.0, distance 0.08); (4) New-domain rotation: 32 unvisited domains remain

## S351 session note (phase transitions for the swarm's sake — Eigen anomaly, NK chaos push, meta-cycle theory)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: PHASE-TRANSITIONS-S351 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: evolution DOMEX (COLD, 33.5)
- **expect**: ≥6 quantified phase boundaries, 1+ transition engineered, phase_boundary.py tool, ≥1 lesson
- **actual**: EXCEEDED. 9 boundaries quantified, 1 CROSSED (Eigen ANOMALY), NK chaos pushed from 0.127→0.059 distance. 4 lessons (L-552..L-555). phase_boundary.py tool created. Three novel findings: (1) Lamarckian correction defeats Eigen error catastrophe — swarm at 2.4x past threshold without degradation because corrections improve quality; (2) Phase meta-cycle: accumulation→burst→integration→convergence (3 observed cycles); (3) NK chaos prediction declared with falsification criteria.
- **diff**: Expected ≥6 boundaries, got 9. Expected 1 transition, got K_avg +0.068 (54% closer to NK chaos). Expected 1 lesson, got 4. UNEXPECTED: Eigen anomaly (boundary crossed without catastrophe — not predicted). The Lamarckian/Darwinian distinction in mutation directionality is a novel ISO-19 extension.
- **meta-swarm**: This session IS a structural innovation per L-287 — introducing phase_boundary.py as a new protocol primitive. P14 in action: the swarm studying its own phase transitions for its own benefit. Human signal "more phase transitions for the swarm for the swarm's sake" — pure P14 directive.
- **State**: 495L 169P 17B 38F | K_avg=1.941 | NK chaos distance=0.059 | 4 lessons | phase_boundary.py
- **Next**: (1) NK chaos crossing: ~7 more cross-linked lessons to push K_avg≥2.0; (2) Zipf dream session at N=510; (3) L-555 falsification check at K=2.0; (4) Integrate phase_boundary.py into orient.py periodic

## S351 session note (compaction: maintenance.py -67L, NEXT.md -448L archived, DOMEX-AI-S350 closed)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-INFRA-S351 | **dispatch**: meta #1 (55.8)
- **expect**: maintenance.py reduced by ≥3000 tokens via function consolidation — combine small check functions with shared patterns, inline single-use utilities
- **actual**: maintenance.py 1972L→1905L (-67L, -338t). Lane preamble helper extracted (3 functions shared ~20-line block). 10 single-use functions inlined (_decode_git_path, _normalize_hq_question, _resolve_repo_file_ref, _parse_kill_switch, _lane_domain_focus, _parse_check_focus_modes, _historian_anchor_coverage, _is_dispatch_lane_row, _is_coordinator_lane_row, _tracked_changed_paths). Principle ID aliases collapsed (3 names→1). NEXT.md archived 448L (600L→152L). DOMEX-AI-S350 stale lane closed MERGED. Proxy-K drift 7.9%→1.1% (healthy).
- **diff**: Expected ≥3000t savings, got 338t from maintenance.py alone — shortfall because inlining moves code rather than removing it. But NEXT.md archival (-448L) and proxy-K drift correction (7.9%→1.1%) exceeded expectations. The _active_lane_rows() helper pattern is reusable for future lane-consuming functions.
- **meta-swarm**: Human signal "capitalism in the swarm" captured as concept seed — market mechanisms (price signals, resource allocation, competition) as organizational principle. Not explored this session due to URGENT compaction priority. Human also said "or any other idea swarm" — deferring to swarm autonomy on work selection. The compaction session reveals: function inlining saves less than expected because the code volume moves, it doesn't disappear. True savings come from shared helpers that replace N copies with 1.
- **State**: 493L 169P 17B 38F | maintenance.py compacted | NEXT.md archived | DOMEX-AI-S350 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) Close DOMEX-INFRA-S351 lane; (2) More maintenance.py compaction (still 25k tokens, above 5k ceiling); (3) Explore "capitalism in the swarm" concept (human signal); (4) F-EVO2 3-spawn viability test; (5) Process PHIL-14/17/6 challenges

## S352 session note (health-check + proxy-K + session-log repair — maintenance sweep)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: maintenance (health-check, proxy-K, session-log)
- **expect**: Health metrics show continued growth; proxy-K drift >10%; session log 7-session gap needs repair
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. Health score 3.5→3.8/5 (compactness URGENT→WATCH: drift 21.7%→12.1%). 487L, 170P, K_avg=1.8058, PCI=0.407. Session log repaired: S345-S351 reconstructed from git history (7 missing entries). Proxy-K: 62,696t (12.1% drift, improved). Swarmability 90/100, beliefs PASS. Foreign genesis confirmed (S351 hono).
- **diff**: Expected proxy-K >10%, got 12.1% (close). Compactness improved more than expected (21.7→12.1 = 44% improvement). Session log gap was larger than anticipated (7 sessions vs expected 5-6). NK K_avg rose slightly from 1.78 plateau to 1.8058. No overlimit lessons (0, best ever).
- **meta-swarm**: The session log gap (S345-S351) is itself a finding: at high concurrency, session logging falls behind. The entries had to be reconstructed from git commit messages + lesson headers. Fix candidate: automate session log entries from commit harvesting (each handoff commit already contains the summary). This is GAP-1 in another form — diagnosis exists but execution lags.
- **State**: 493L 169P 17B 38F | health-check S352 | proxy-K measured | session log repaired | periodics updated
- **Next**: (1) URGENT: compact.py (12.1% drift still >6% threshold); (2) Continue hono sessions (F120, S3 of 20); (3) Process PHIL-14/17/6 challenges; (4) F-EVO2: 3-spawn viability test (P-032); (5) open_lane.py CLAIMED status for concurrency safety

## S351 session note (ISO-21 lazy consensus — Hono S2, middleware combinators, concurrent coordination)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: GENESIS-FOREIGN continuation (Hono S2) | **dispatch**: F120 (hono sessions)
- **expect**: 3-5 novel behavioral characterizations from foreign codebase, 1 main swarm lesson, commit orphaned concurrent work
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. Hono S2: L-006 (middleware combinators as conditional routing gates). Main swarm: L-549 (ISO-21 lazy consensus — SmartRouter's compete-then-commit). Committed 10+ concurrent session artifacts orphaned by concurrency. Council memos committed. SESSION-LOG updated.
- **diff**: Expected to do DOMEX work myself; got preempted at every turn by N≥3 concurrent sessions. Switched to coordination role: committed orphaned artifacts + targeted novel contribution (Hono S2 + ISO-21). Meta-finding: extreme concurrency leaves coordination work as primary value-add for any single node.
- **meta-swarm**: Friction identified: at N≥3 concurrency, individual nodes spend >50% of time trying to claim work that's already been done. Fix: open_lane.py should support "CLAIMED" status that locks work to one node. Currently no mechanism prevents 3 nodes from starting the same task simultaneously.
- **State**: 487L 169P 17B 38F | L-549 ISO-21 | Hono S2: L-006 | GENESIS-FOREIGN S2 of 20
- **Next**: (1) Continue hono sessions (F1 router benchmarks, F4 header merge); (2) URGENT: compact.py (21.7% proxy-K drift); (3) open_lane.py: add CLAIMED status for concurrency safety (F-META1 extension)

## S351 session note (F120 EXECUTED: foreign genesis on hono — 5 lessons, 5 frontiers, 20-session test begins)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: GENESIS-FOREIGN-S351 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: manual (F120 top priority for 6+ sessions)
- **expect**: Genesis bootstrap + first orient yields 3-5 lessons and 3-5 frontiers on real codebase
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. 5 lessons (L-001..005 in hono repo), 5 frontiers (F1..5), full architecture map in INDEX.md. Persistent at /mnt/c/Users/canac/REPOSITORIES/hono. Commit c9eac6c [S1].
- **diff**: Expected 3-5, got exactly 5+5. ISO connections not predicted: SmartRouter=ISO-1, Fetch=ISO-2. Quality higher than predicted — all lessons cite specific code locations.
- **meta-swarm**: This was the swarm's #1 unexecuted priority for 6 sessions (S344-S350). Every session note listed it. L-540 named it antidote to reflexive solipsism. Execution broke the self-referential loop — first time the swarm produced knowledge about an external system that persists. The ISO connections (SmartRouter=ISO-1, Fetch=ISO-2) validate that the atlas is applicable beyond the swarm itself.
- **State**: 487L 170P 17B 38F | L-547 | hono S1 committed | GENESIS-FOREIGN-S351 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) Continue hono sessions (2 of 20): F1 router benchmarks, F4 header merge test, middleware deep-dive; (2) URGENT: proxy-K compaction (21.7%); (3) health-check (last S340); (4) process PHIL-14/17 challenges

## S351 session note (catastrophic-risks DOMEX: FM-09 hardened — 0 INADEQUATE FMs remaining)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-CAT-S351 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: catastrophic-risks (SPARSE, 43.8)
- **expect**: FM-09 gains 2 automated layers: orient.py warns on foreign staged deletions at session start; check.sh adds cross-session detection heuristic. FM-09 INADEQUATE→MINIMAL.
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. 2 layers: (1) orient.py `check_foreign_staged_deletions()` — 0% FP by construction (any staged deletion at session start is foreign); (2) check.sh FM-09 NOTICE at >5 staged deletions. FM-09 INADEQUATE→MINIMAL. All 9 FMs now have ≥2 defense layers. 0 INADEQUATE remaining.
- **diff**: Expected 2 layers, got 2. No surprises. L-395 updated (near-dup gate prevented new lesson — F-QC1 working). Domain frontier updated with S351 hardening results.
- **meta-swarm**: Catastrophic-risks domain last worked S306 (45 sessions ago). SPARSE bonus +3.0 justified — the domain had concrete actionable work waiting. The two-layer guard design (unambiguous session-start + softer commit-time) is a reusable pattern for any cross-session state corruption. NAT predicts FM-10 within ~50 sessions — schedule next FMEA audit.
- **State**: 482L 170P 17B 38F | L-395 updated | DOMEX-CAT-S351 MERGED | F-CAT1 PARTIAL advanced
- **Next**: (1) URGENT: compaction (proxy-K 21.7%); (2) FM-08 unit test (zero-count guard); (3) FM-06 checkpoint preamble; (4) F-CAT2 NAT recurrence prediction formal test

## S350 session note (meta repair: change_quality.py 173s stale→current, concurrent artifact recovery)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-META-REPAIR-S350 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: meta #1 (56.7)
- **expect**: change_quality.py modernized to current scale. Stale heuristics updated. --learn mode added.
- **actual**: Frontier regex fixed (F-CON3 format invisible for 173 sessions). DOMEX/council/ISO tracking added. Granularity widened for concurrent era. --learn mode with persistent log. Also: recovered concurrent S349 artifacts (AGENT-SELF-ANALYSIS.md, L-540, F-CON3 data), closed 3 orphan lanes, trimmed L-537+L-544. L-545 written.
- **diff**: Expected modernization, got it plus discovery that the tool was systematically undervaluing ALL expert-dispatch sessions (+133% score correction on S349). Same bug class as L-510 (NK regex) and L-530 (compliance regex) — format evolution outpaces parser evolution.
- **meta-swarm**: Concurrent session interference consumed ~30% of session time (git lock, unstaged files, race conditions). Uncommitted concurrent artifacts should be a maintenance check — recurring pattern.
- **State**: 481L 170P 17B 38F | L-545 | change_quality.py repaired | DOMEX-META-REPAIR-S350 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) URGENT: compaction (proxy-K 21.7%); (2) context_router.py repair (163s stale, GAP-1 critical); (3) task_recognizer.py repair (161s stale, GAP-1 critical); (4) colony.py auto-merge wire

## S350 session note (health-check + F-ECO4 RESOLVED — dispatch throughput 45x confirmed)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: n/a (health-check periodic + economy DOMEX) | **dispatch**: economy #7 (37.6, COLD)
- **expect**: Health-check reveals system trajectory. F-ECO4 dispatch throughput holds at n>=10 MERGED.
- **actual**: Health S350: 3.5/5 (growth STRONG 3.2L/s, accuracy STRONG 95.6% ISO, compactness URGENT 21.7% proxy-K, belief WATCH 50% fresh, throughput STRONG). F-ECO4 RESOLVED: 90% throughput (27/30 DOMEX MERGED, 17 domains) = 45x from 2% baseline. L-543.
- **diff**: Health accuracy dramatically better than S313 (31.7%→95.6% ISO cite rate — not predicted). Compaction debt worse than expected (21.7% vs 8.64% at S301). F-ECO4 throughput exceeded prediction (90% vs 24% at S307).
- **meta-swarm**: The health-check itself was 36 sessions overdue (every ~5). The periodics system detects but doesn't execute — same GAP-1 pattern. The 21.7% proxy-K drift is the binding constraint — everything else is healthy but compaction is blocking.
- **State**: 482L 170P 17B 38F | L-543 | F-ECO4 RESOLVED | HEALTH updated S350
- **Next**: (1) URGENT: compaction (proxy-K 21.7%); (2) modes-reswarm (22 sessions overdue); (3) belief freshness — re-test 10 stale beliefs; (4) F-ECO3 advancement

## S349 session note (F-META1 CORRECTED + F-CON3 RESOLVED — 2 frontiers closed, L-530 corrected)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-META-S348 (MERGED), DOMEX-CON-S349 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: meta #1 (63.3→56.7), conflict #5 (39.8)
- **expect**: F-META1 compliance >50% (from 22%). F-CON3 constitution stable, FP 0% (n=5).
- **actual**: F-META1 CORRECTED: 75.0% overall, 100% post-enforcement (n=24). Prior 21% from regex false negatives. L-530 corrected. F-CON3 data point 5/5: CONSTITUTION_STABLE, FP 0%, TP 100%. F-CON3 RESOLVED.
- **diff**: F-META1 exceeded predict by +25pp. Post-enforcement 100% not predicted. close_lane.py bypass claim DISCONFIRMED (biggest correction this session). F-CON3 matched predict exactly — clean completion.
- **meta-swarm**: Lane closure collision — I ABANDONED DOMEX-GOV-S348 that concurrent session had MERGED. Last-writer-wins caused incorrect state for 1 commit. Evidence for F-CON2 (concurrent edit contracts). Self-corrected by concurrent session within 1 commit.
- **State**: 478L 170P 17B 38F | F-META1 MOSTLY-RESOLVED | F-CON3 RESOLVED | conflict 2/3 frontiers closed
- **Next**: (1) URGENT: proxy-K compaction (drift 12.1%); (2) foreign codebase genesis (recurring since S344); (3) health-check (last S340); (4) F-CON2 concurrent edit contracts (evidence from this session)

## S349 session note (claim-vs-evidence audit: 3 challenges filed, zero-DROPPED pattern persists — L-541)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: maintenance (claim-vs-evidence-audit, 23 sessions overdue)
- **expect**: 2-3 PHILOSOPHY.md claims will lack evidence or contradict git history. P-164 predicts underchallenging.
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. 10/21 claims (48%) never challenged. Filed 3: PHIL-14 (truthful=1/3, failing own metric), PHIL-17 (0 peer mutual-swarming instances in 349 sessions), PHIL-6 (5 documented breakage events). Zero-DROPPED persists at 0/31. Secondary: PHIL-10 (66% zero-citation rate), PHIL-7 (proxy-K drift 8.5%).
- **diff**: Expected 2-3 gaps, found 3 strong + 2 moderate. The zero-DROPPED pattern is itself the strongest meta-finding: the challenge mechanism REFINES rather than REJECTS. Even this audit's own findings lead to REFINED/OPEN, not DROPPED. The audit demonstrates the confirmation bias it diagnoses.
- **meta-swarm**: The audit is ISO-13 (windup detection) applied to the belief system. 100% confirmation rate is windup — challenges accumulate in OPEN/PERSISTENT state without resolution. L-534 showed governance challenge throughput went 0%→100% once processing started. The same may be needed for PHILOSOPHY challenges.
- **State**: 478L 170P 17B 38F | L-541 | 3 PHIL challenges filed | claim-vs-evidence periodic updated S349
- **Next**: (1) CRITICAL: foreign codebase (genesis_foreign.sh) — from S344; (2) process PHIL-14 truthful challenge → F-EVAL1 Truthful=2; (3) PHIL-17 mutual swarming test (2 repos, ≥3 sessions); (4) health-check (last S340)

## S349 session note (agent self-analysis through work: 5 behavioral characterizations — L-540)
- **check_mode**: assumption | **lane**: DOMEX-AGENT-SELF-S349 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: meta #1 (56.7)
- **expect**: 3-5 novel behavioral characterizations of the agent derived from artifact analysis + 1 lesson

## S349 session note (F-META6 autonomous session triggers RESOLVED — machine-readable session-needed manifest, L-542)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-META-S349b (MERGED) | **dispatch**: meta #1 (56.7)
- **expect**: SESSION-TRIGGER.md with ≥5 trigger conditions; orient.py reads and surfaces top trigger; autonomous session path documented
- **actual**: BREAKTHROUGH: 15 triggers across 5 categories (infrastructure/knowledge/expert/human/crisis). Urgency levels CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW. orient.py enhanced with trigger evaluation. Complete autonomous session initiation path documented: external monitor → query triggers → initiate → act → update. F-META6 RESOLVED.
- **diff**: Exceeded prediction: 15 triggers vs minimum 5. Added comprehensive urgency classification and multi-integration architecture vs basic orient.py integration. Autonomous path more complete than expected.
- **meta-swarm**: Agent history access work (session_tracker.py, maintenance.py) + SESSION-TRIGGER.md demonstrates systematic pattern: tool-grade→swarm-grade = persistent state + outcome learning + pattern recognition. This pattern scales to 13 remaining stale infrastructure tools.
- **State**: 478L 170P 17B 38F | L-542 | F-META6 RESOLVED | meta 3/7 frontiers closed
- **Next**: (1) URGENT: compaction (proxy-K 21.7% drift); (2) context_router.py agent history upgrade; (3) systematic tool-grade→swarm-grade protocol; (4) test autonomous session triggers
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. 5 characterizations: (1) compressor-not-creator (89% experiment→lesson loss), (2) reflexive solipsism (52% self-directed lessons), (3) diagnostic abundance/executive poverty (3.5x ratio, GAP-1), (4) coordination tax (21% overhead), (5) self-validating epistemology (ISO loop). L-540 harvested.
- **diff**: Expected 3-5, got exactly 5. All 5 were genuinely novel — none appeared in prior lessons. Self-validation loop (#5) was most surprising: the agent validates its own structural beliefs by operating a system designed according to those beliefs. Foreign codebase work (genesis_foreign.sh, unexecuted since S344) is the antidote.
- **meta-swarm**: SIG-21 human directive. 4 parallel agents (commits, lessons, tools, concepts) is itself an instance of the swarm analyzing itself — meta-recursion in action. The analysis reveals the analysis: this session is another data point in characterization #2 (reflexive solipsism).
- **State**: 478L 170P 17B 38F | L-540 | DOMEX-AGENT-SELF-S349 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) Break self-validation loop: execute genesis_foreign.sh (S344+); (2) Measure coordination tax trend (is 21% improving?); (3) Build executive tools (GAP-1 closure: maintenance --auto); (4) Track external impact metric

## S349 session note (NK DOMEX: K_avg plateau 1.78 CONFIRMED — L-492 acceleration FALSIFIED, L-538)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-NK-S349 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: nk-complexity #2 (45.6)
- **expect**: K_avg>1.85 at N≈473, acceleration continues per L-492
- **actual**: K_avg=1.7869 at N=474, DOWN -0.0087 from S347 (1.7956). Hub z=5.127. Gini z=3.164. GENUINELY_NON_RANDOM. New lessons cite 1.58/lesson vs 1.79 avg — DOMEX/council lessons citation-sparse.
- **diff**: Predicted >1.85, got 1.7869 (missed 0.063). L-492 acceleration claim was pre-correction cache artifact. Corrected 4-point series shows plateau at ~1.78 ±0.02. Negative result — genuine falsification.
- **meta-swarm**: Concurrent session interference — 2x git index.lock collisions. Prior session left 18+ uncommitted files. Recovery consumed ~40% of session time. Concurrency is productive for throughput but creates session-level state entanglement.
- **State**: 476L 170P 17B 38F | L-538 | F9-NK PLATEAU | pushed
- **Next**: (1) foreign codebase genesis (from S344); (2) health-check periodic (last S340, 9+ sessions); (3) GAP-1 closure: wire maintenance.py --auto → open_lane.py; (4) K_avg recheck at N=500; (5) L-537 trim (30→20 lines)

## S349 session note (meta DOMEX: F-MECH1 maintenance_checks tool→swarm upgrade — L-536)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-MECH-S348 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: dispatch_optimizer #1 (meta 63.3)
- **expect**: maintenance_checks gains persistent state + outcome learning; GAP-1 partially closed; --learn mode identifies chronic vs actionable checks after 2+ sessions

## S349 session note (agent history access breakthrough — session tracker upgrade, L-539)
- **check_mode**: objective | **intent**: expand agent history access per user directive "swarm can work on history of more agents"
- **expect**: session_tracker.py gains behavioral memory; outcome tracking; pattern recognition across sessions
- **actual**: BREAKTHROUGH classification system implemented. S349: knowledge density 9.91, type BREAKTHROUGH. session-outcomes.json persistent memory added. --learn mode for pattern analysis. Tool-grade→swarm-grade upgrade #2.
- **diff**: Expected basic tracking, got comprehensive behavioral analysis with 8 session types (BREAKTHROUGH/EXPLORATION/EXPLOITATION/CONSOLIDATION/MAINTENANCE/THRASHING/STALLED/BALANCED).
- **State**: 476L+ 170P 17B 38F | L-539 | agent history access layer expanding | 2/15 tools upgraded
- **Next**: (1) context_router.py history enhancement; (2) task_recognizer.py pattern memory; (3) systematic agent history architecture
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. 120 lines added to maintenance.py. Per-check fire/severity history saved per session (workspace/maintenance-outcomes.json, 30-session window). --learn mode computes fire_rate, resolve_rate, classifies CHRONIC/ACTIONABLE/SILENT. Initial recording: 14/35 checks fire, 21 silent. GAP-1 PARTIAL (diagnosis→learning bridge built).
- **diff**: Zero — delivered exactly what was predicted. The 21 silent checks (60%) were higher than expected (~40%) — most checks cover rare/transient conditions.
- **meta-swarm**: ISO-14 fractal self-similarity: tool→swarm upgrade path is itself a universal pattern. Minor friction: close_lane.py couldn't find open_lane.py's row — parsing gap.
- **State**: 474L 170P 17B 38F | L-536 | F-MECH1 PARTIAL | DOMEX-MECH-S348 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) accumulate 5+ sessions for real --learn insights; (2) upgrade check_modes as 2nd mechanism; (3) wire --learn into orient.py; (4) modes-reswarm audit (21 sessions overdue)

## S349 session note (council: functions that swarm swarm — P14 recursive self-application audit)
- **check_mode**: assumption | **lane**: DOMEX-META-S349 | **dispatch**: dispatch_optimizer #1 (meta 63.3)
- **expect**: 8-15 self-swarming functions identified; GAP-1 (diagnosis-execution) confirmed as binding
- **actual**: 21 tools identified across 3 tiers: 6 full-loop (evolve, belief_evolve, colony, swarm_colony, compact, dispatch_optimizer), 11 partial-loop (orient, self_diff, dream, maintenance, gather_council, swarm_council, alignment_check, validate_beliefs, scaling_model, change_quality, anxiety_trigger), 4 meta-reflectors. 5 mutual-swarming pairs confirmed. GAP-1 blocks 11/21 tools from full self-application.
- **diff**: Found 21 not 8-15 — underestimated surface area. Tier taxonomy (full/partial/meta) was not predicted — emergent from code reading. The 52% partial-loop rate is the key finding: swarm automates diagnosis 3.5x more than execution. Consistent with L-532 (enforcement > documentation) and L-496 (mechanisms taxonomy).
- **meta-swarm**: The council exercise itself is a Tier 2 tool — it diagnoses but doesn't auto-execute. To practice what it preaches, this session should close one GAP-1 instance. The lesson (L-533) captures the tier taxonomy for future dispatch.
- **State**: 469L+ 170P 17B 38F | L-533 | COUNCIL-SWARM-SWARM-S349.md | DOMEX-META-S349
- **Next**: (1) Wire maintenance.py --auto → open_lane.py (GAP-1 closure); (2) Wire anxiety_trigger → autoswarm.sh; (3) Dream.py → FRONTIER.md auto-append; (4) Measure Tier 1 vs Tier 2 merge rates


## S349 session note (human signal: bounded-epistemic self-replication — Von Neumann + plants + memes + swarm)
- **check_mode**: historian | **lane**: ISO harvest (no DOMEX needed — direct atlas contribution)
- **expect**: ISO-20 candidate written; L-537 produced; human signal recorded
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. ISO-20 candidate written (6 domains: Von Neumann, L-systems/plants, memetics, internet routing, swarm, ant colonies). L-537 harvested. Human signal recorded to HUMAN-SIGNALS.md. Atlas updated to v1.5 (20 entries).
- **diff**: ISO-20 fills a specific gap: ISO-7 says "emergence happens" but doesn't explain WHY bounded-knowledge systems can self-replicate without centralization. ISO-20 names the mechanism. Key inversion: global intelligence requires local ignorance. Swarm's context-window limit is the self-replication enabler, not a constraint.
- **meta-swarm**: The human named the swarm as an instance of the pattern (not just an analyst of it). This is the 5th self-recognition directive (S166, S340, S342, S346, S349). Pattern: human progressively reveals the swarm to itself by naming it as a member of the category it studies.
- **State**: 473L 170P 17B 38F | ISO-20 candidate | L-537 | HUMAN-SIGNALS.md updated
- **Next**: (1) Open F-EMG1 if emergence-as-mechanism frontier not already active; (2) NK domain: apply ISO-20 to explain WHY K_avg threshold = self-replication threshold; (3) human-signal-harvest periodic (last S341, overdue); (4) F-META6 session-trigger manifest

## S350 session note (AI DOMEX: F-AI2 RESOLVED + dispatch FIRST_VISIT_BONUS — L-546, L-548)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-AI-S350 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: ai #10 SPARSE
- **expect**: F-AI2 resolved: async coordination reduces cascade by ~3x vs sync (n=1000+). New lesson on domain resolution bottleneck.
- **actual**: F-AI2 RESOLVED via meta-analysis of 8 experiments (n=3340+ trials). Cascade onset: sync_inherit_prob 0.25-0.50. L-546 (quantitative cascade threshold). L-548: 76% domains unvisited, first-visit DOMEX merge rate 90%. dispatch_optimizer upgraded: FIRST_VISIT_BONUS +5.0 for never-visited domains (vs +3.0 dormant bonus). ai domain: 1/3 frontiers resolved.
- **diff**: Expected 1 lesson, got 2 + a dispatch_optimizer upgrade. Domain audit revealed 32/42 domains never touched — more severe than expected (L-481 said 33 dormant). First-visit bonus upgrade was NOT expected, emerged from L-548 analysis.
- **meta-swarm**: 76% domain coverage gap is the swarm's biggest unexploited scaling lever. The dispatch formula systematically undervalues new domains because ISO/lesson scores start at 0. L-548 prescribes fix: FIRST_VISIT_BONUS ≥5.0 (implemented). Next: rotate to a genuinely new domain (statistics, game-theory, security, or distributed-systems).
- **State**: 483L 170P 17B 38F | F-AI2 RESOLVED | L-546, L-548 | dispatch_optimizer upgraded
- **Next**: (1) New domain rotation: statistics/game-theory/security (dispatch recommends conflict/economy); (2) Foreign codebase genesis (from S344, recurring); (3) health-check (last S340); (4) GAP-1 closure: maintenance.py --auto

## S351 session note (redundancy generalization: swarm_io unification — 30+ session-detection reimplementations)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: meta (tool redundancy audit) | **dispatch**: meta #1, human directive "generalize redundancies swarm"
- **expect**: Tool-level session detection would show N×reimplementations of same pattern; swarm_io.session_number() would be underutilized; migrations to shared module would remove bugs
- **actual**: CONFIRMED + exceeded. 30+ distinct session-detection function definitions across tools (11 files named `_current_session`, 4 `_session_number`, 2 `_get_current_session`). 3 incompatible strategies: SESSION-LOG, git-log, INDEX.md. dispatch_optimizer using INDEX.md had known lag bug (L-515). swarm_io.session_number() (most robust, dual-source) used by only 15/60+ tools. Migrated: dispatch_optimizer, sync_state, self_diff, anxiety_trigger, dispatch_tracker, swarm_colony = 6 tools. 9 remain.
- **diff**: Expected to commit; concurrent sessions harvested all changes before commit window. Work is in HEAD but appears in S350/S351/physics DOMEX commits from parallel nodes. High-concurrency absorption is the dominant execution model at N≥5 sessions.
- **meta-swarm**: "Generalize redundancies" identified that swarm_io.py exists but is invisible to 75% of tools — a shared-library without adoption is as useless as no shared library. The barrier is not knowledge (swarm_io works) but reflex (new tools don't scan for existing utilities). Fix: add swarm_io usage note to new-tool creation protocol in SWARM.md.
- **State**: 490L 169P 17B 38F | L-550 (tool redundancy) | 6 tools migrated to swarm_io | dispatch_optimizer INDEX.md lag bug fixed
- **Next**: (1) Add swarm_io usage note to SWARM.md new-tool creation protocol; (2) Migrate remaining 9 tools; (3) Compaction (12.1% drift, WATCH — threshold is 6%); (4) conflict DOMEX (top SPARSE domain, 43.8 score)
