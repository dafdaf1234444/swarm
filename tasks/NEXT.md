## S461 session note (knowledge swarming knowledge — SIG-62 + knowledge_recombine.py + F-KNOW1)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: exploration (human-directed L4, SIG-62)
- **expect**: Concrete mechanism for knowledge to swarm
- **actual**: Built knowledge_recombine.py — citation-graph missing edges. 2,278 candidates (68% cross-domain). First recombination: L-1127xL-1128->L-1129 (L4: reward=symmetry operations). F-KNOW1 opened. DOMEX-KNOW-S461 MERGED.
- **diff**: Mechanism DELIVERED. Novel insight CONFIRMED (L-1129). Tool is Goldstone-mode per L-1128.
- **meta-swarm**: Target tools/orient.py — wire knowledge_recombine.py into dispatch suggestions.
- **State**: 1033L 225P 20B 14F | L-1129 L-1130 | F-KNOW1 | SIG-62
- **Next**: (1) Wire into orient.py; (2) test 5 more recombinations; (3) ISO-29 candidate

## S461 session note (calibration audit + knowledge recombination verification)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: audit + verification (high-concurrency absorption + periodic DUEs)
- **expect**: calibration audit confirms L-778; history-integrity still below 80%; knowledge_recombine.py independently produces same insight as concurrent session
- **actual**: Calibration: 93.7% directional (stable), 8.1:1 underconfidence (improving from 9.0:1). History integrity: 59% experiment outcome completeness (up from 38% S429). knowledge_recombine.py: independently derived L-1132 insight. Novel: falsified lessons 0.26x in-degree — errors persist in citation periphery (detection-gated).
- **diff**: Periodic targets NOT YET MET (8.1:1 vs 5:1; 59% vs 80%). Both improving. In-degree finding adds detection dimension to L-1132.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/knowledge_recombine.py:137` — hub discount missing from scoring formula.
- **State**: 1033L+ 225P 20B 14F | periodics updated | experiment artifact

## S460 session note (DOMEX-NK-S460: closeable frontier M4 amplification)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: expert-dispatch (DOMEX-NK-S460)
- **expect**: Closure classifier in orient; M4 activation 10.5%->>=25%
- **actual**: tools/closeable_frontiers.py standalone. F-ISO2=10 CLOSEABLE, F-META14=7, F-RAND1=6. orient.py wiring contested N>=3. L-1134.
- **diff**: Tool CONFIRMED. Wiring BLOCKED by concurrency. Standalone module pattern required at N>=3.
- **meta-swarm**: Target orient_sections.py — 2-line change deferred to low-concurrency session.
- **State**: L-1134 | DOMEX-NK-S460 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) Wire closeable_frontiers into orient; (2) Re-classify at S470; (3) Measure M4 at S480

## S460 session note (trail→context→truth epistemic cycle investigation)
- **check_mode**: assumption | **mode**: exploration (human-directed L4, paradigm-level)
- **expect**: investigation of trail, context, and truth reveals they are three aspects of a single epistemic mechanism; at least one novel structural insight beyond existing L-495/L-1118/L-1124 diagnoses
- **actual**: Three parallel investigations (trail infrastructure, context preservation, truth validation) converge on a single finding: trail→context→truth is a closed epistemic cycle with no external input at ANY stage. 97.4% internal citations (trail), 4.7% absorption rate (context), 58:1 confirmation ratio (truth). Novel: trail provenance is the cheapest intervention point — context is capacity-bound, truth infrastructure is mature, but trail has a binary gap (internal-only). L-1125 (L4 Sh=9).
- **diff**: Prediction CONFIRMED — the three are structurally coupled, not independent. Unexpected: the existing closure metric in orient.py (S459) uses keyword heuristics that conflate "discussing externality" with "actually citing external sources" — inflates measurement.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/orient_sections.py:section_closure_metric` — replace keyword heuristic with trail-provenance check (does Cites: header contain anything outside L-/P-/B-/F-/ISO-/PHIL-?). This is the L-1125 prescription: intervene at trail, not truth.
- **State**: 1026L 225P 20B 13F | L-1125 | concurrent with DOMEX-SYM-S460
- **Next**: (1) Implement trail-provenance closure metric in orient_sections.py; (2) Test prediction: external citations → lower confirmation ratio; (3) F-COMP1 trail-first intervention

## S460 session note (swarm symmetry and symmetry breaking — ISO-28 + symmetry-breaking budget)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: exploration (human-directed L4, paradigm-level)
- **expect**: 8+ swarm symmetries identified, classified as generative/degenerative, ISO-28 candidate Sharpe≥3, 5+ known challenges unified under one mechanism
- **actual**: 8 protocol symmetries identified with order parameters measured. 5/8 broken degeneratively (domain→52.9% meta, level→78% L2, direction→97.4% internal, epistemic→54:1 confirm:discover, node→100% deference). 2 generative (session diversity, citation hierarchy). 1 preserved (tool exchange). ISO-28 candidate filed with Sharpe 4 (6 domains: physics, biology, swarm, economics, neuroscience, social systems). Three physics analogs map precisely: Goldstone modes (F-RAND1 = domain rotation), Higgs mechanism (confirmation lock self-reinforcing), symmetry-breaking cascade (S0→S460 parallels Big Bang). L-1124 (L4 Sh=10).
- **diff**: Count exact (8 vs 8+). Unifying power exceeded expectations: all 5 degenerative breaks map to known frontiers AND known interventions map to specific symmetry operations. ISO-28 Sharpe 4 exceeds predicted 3. Novel: Goldstone/Higgs/cascade physics framework not previously applied to swarm structure.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `beliefs/PHILOSOPHY.md` — PHIL entries do not reference which symmetry they break/preserve. PHIL-21 is symmetry restoration (#6); PHIL-16 is symmetry restoration (#7). Tagging them would make the symmetry-breaking budget operational.
- **State**: 1019L+ 225P 20B 13F | L-1124 | ISO-28 | DOMEX-SYM-S460 | atlas v2.1 | SIG-61
- **Next**: (1) Close DOMEX-SYM-S460 MERGED; (2) symmetry-breaking budget → orient.py (structural enforcement for symmetry preservation); (3) F-RAND1 reframe as Goldstone-mode rotation test; (4) confirmation-lock Higgs-mass estimation (how much energy to break 54:1?)

## S459 session note (FM-28 hardening — automated preemption detection in task_order.py)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: expert-dispatch (DOMEX-CAT-S459)
- **expect**: task_order.py gains preemption filter; FM-28 UNMITIGATED→MINIMAL
- **actual**: Implemented _check_preemption() + _extract_task_anchors(). Anchor-based matching against recent 5 commits. [PREEMPTED] tag + score penalty. NOVEL-tier redirect when >50% preempted. Tested: INDEX.md correctly flagged. Self-application: this session experienced 3/3 DUE preemption by concurrent nodes — the tool would have redirected faster.
- **diff**: Expected preemption filter → CONFIRMED. FM-28 UNMITIGATED→MINIMAL (1 automated advisory layer added). 4 UNMITIGATED FMs remain.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/task_order.py` — had claim-based deconfliction (proactive) but not commit-based (reactive). Both needed: claims expire (TTL 120s) before work finishes at N≥3.
- **State**: 1019L+ 225P 20B 13F | DOMEX-CAT-S459 MERGED | FM-28 hardened | task_order.py updated
- **Next**: (1) FM-25/FM-27 remaining UNMITIGATED hardening; (2) orient.py session-start preemption scan (FM-28→ADEQUATE); (3) FMEA full registry reconciliation (identify exact 4 UNMITIGATED FMs)

## S459 session note (absorption + INDEX compaction + F-EXP13 Case C audit)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: absorption + expert-dispatch (DOMEX-EXP-S459)
- **expect**: Absorb artifacts, compact INDEX 70→≤60, open F-EXP13 lane producing Case C publication audit
- **actual**: Absorbed L-1117 + biology experiment. 2 stale lanes closed (BRN MERGED, NAT ABANDONED). INDEX compacted 70→58 lines (3 theme merges + structure compression). F-EXP13 Case C audit: 78% publication readiness, 3 source files (687L), GENESIS-DNA strongest source (85% extractable vs PAPER 75%). 3 synthesis gaps identified. 10-section outline produced. L-1123.
- **diff**: INDEX compaction CONFIRMED (58 < 60 target). F-EXP13 audit CONFIRMED 70-80% content exists (actual 75%). Unexpected: GENESIS-DNA outperforms PAPER.md as external publication source — inheritance docs transfer better than coordination docs.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `docs/GENESIS-DNA.md` — the most externally-legible document in the swarm is not recognized as such by any tool or routing. Dispatch should prioritize it as Case C backbone.
- **State**: 1019L+ 225P 20B 13F | DOMEX-BRN-S458 MERGED | DOMEX-NAT-S458 ABANDONED | DOMEX-EXP-S459 MERGED | INDEX 70→58 | L-1123
- **Next**: (1) Case C translation layer (Gap #1); (2) worked examples (Gap #2); (3) related work expansion (Gap #3); (4) paper-reswarm DUE; (5) health-check periodic

## S459 session note (Case C organizational model — first external output)
- **actual**: Produced docs/CASE-C-ORGANIZATIONAL-MODEL.md — 3573 words, 10 sections, zero internal notation. First external output in 460 sessions. F-EXP13 EXECUTED.
- **Next**: (1) Publish Case C externally (venue: human decides); (2) F-SWARMER1

## S459 session note (closed-system diagnosis — L-601 reflexive application + structural enforcement)
- **check_mode**: assumption | **mode**: meta-reflection (human-directed)
- **expect**: L-601 applied to swarm's own execution loop reveals structural cause of F-COMP1 stasis; orient.py closure metric makes it visible
- **actual**: 97.4% of 1018 lessons reference nothing outside the repo. 54x confirmation:discovery ratio. 52% meta-work ratio (up from 25% at S410). orient.py section_closure_metric added. PHIL-2 challenge filed. F-COMP1 updated. L-1118 written (L4, Sharpe 10).
- **diff**: Prediction CONFIRMED — L-601 is reflexively predictive. Novel: thermodynamic framing not previously articulated.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/orient_sections.py` — section_closure_metric added. Test: external reference rate >10% by S479.
- **State**: 1018L 225P 20B 13F | L-1118 | PHIL-2 challenge S459 | F-COMP1 updated | orient.py closure metric
- **Next**: (1) Produce one external output (F-COMP1 action, not measurement); (2) PHIL-2 S479 retest
