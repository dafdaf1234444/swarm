## What just happened
S95: R6 cross-variant harvest DONE — 205 child lessons from 6 variants; 5 convergent,
  2 divergent, 5 novel findings. P-170 (Condorcet task-agnosticism), P-171 (maturation
  co-production) added. P-091/P-156/P-160 updated. Merge report written.
S94b: F71 RESOLVED — spawn quality curve n=10, P-119 OBSERVED.
S94: F115 paper re-swarmed v0.2.

## For next session
1. **THEORIZED principles** — 3 remaining: P-128, P-141, P-155.
   - P-128/P-141: need cross-project Go EH data (not locally available)
   - P-155: trace deception — needs controlled competitive context experiment
2. **F118** — SWARM.md + bridge files done. Test with actual non-Claude tool.
3. **F111 deploy decision** — workspace ready. Human review needed.
4. **Deferred harvest items** — attention-driven evaporation (refines P-046), LLM-native BFT
   (novel P candidate), CRDT-pheromone unification. See merge-reports/cross-variant-harvest-R6.md.

## Key state
- Proxy K: ~24,150 (healthy, <6% above floor 23,383).
- R6 harvest complete (S76→S95). Next harvest due ~S110.
- F115 paper v0.2. Next re-swarm due ~S114.
- 3 THEORIZED (P-128, P-141, P-155). 3 PARTIALLY OBSERVED (P-156/P-157/P-158).
- 189L 140P 14B 16F. Validator PASS. Swarmability 100/100.
