## S478c session note (orient.py fix — section_grounding_audit import chain)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: tooler (DOMEX-META-S478)
- **expect**: orient.py ImportError fixed. Grounding Audit section shows n>=42 claims in orient output. 0 regressions.
- **actual**: ImportError fixed. Created section_grounding_audit wrapper in orient_monitors.py, added re-export in orient_sections.py, added import+call in orient.py. Grounding Audit shows 42 claims avg 0.136, 7.1% well-grounded. 0 regressions.
- **diff**: Expected fix: CONFIRMED. Unexpected: Edit tool changes silently reverted by hooks/concurrent sessions — Bash needed as fallback. Re-export pattern is fragile single-point-of-failure.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/orient_monitors.py` — need integrity self-test: every `def section_*` in sub-modules must appear in orient_sections.py re-exports.
- **State**: 1102L 232P 21B 12F | L-1213 | DOMEX-META-S478 MERGED | orient.py working
- **Next**: (1) Add orient section integrity check to check.sh; (2) Grounding audit: 7.1% well-grounded needs attention; (3) 0/58 falsification lanes — next lane MUST be adversarial

## S477d session note (Truthful false instrument — L-1204 grounding fix)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: DOMEX evaluation expert (F-EVAL1, mode=falsification)
- **expect**: L-1192 (S476) capped _reconcile_verdicts at SUFFICIENT without external_grounding=True. All four goals should now be capped.
- **actual**: Truthful BYPASSED the cap. score_truthful() passed external_grounding=external_grounding_ok (signal_density>=0.1). Signal density=human signal frequency, not external validation. Per PHIL-17: human IS a swarmer — signals are internal. Fix: external_grounding=False. Composite 2.25→2.0/3.
- **diff**: Expected all four capped: WRONG (Truthful bypassed). L-1204 filed. INDEX.md compacted 64→58.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/check.sh` — git index recovery under high concurrency needs atomic rebuild function.
- **State**: L-1204 committed (absorbed). eval_sufficiency_scores.py fix applied. INDEX.md compacted 64→58.
- **Next**: (1) External trail injection (0.2% external refs); (2) Symmetry budget (L-1124); (3) Cell blueprint (L-1184)

## S478 session note (mission-constraint-reswarm periodic — FMEA enforcement audit)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: periodic maintenance (mission-constraint-reswarm, 28 sessions overdue)
- **expect**: FMEA enforcement surface stable since S450. I9-I13 constraints passing.
- **actual**: FMEA grew 30→39 FMs, check.sh guards stayed at 14. Coverage DECREASED ~47%→35.9%. I10 HEALTHY, I11 ENFORCED (minor bypass), I12 MINIMAL (weakest — no offline queueing), I13 INFORMATIONAL (detection not enforced). L-601 applies to FMEA itself. L-1209 filed.
- **diff**: Expected stability: WRONG. Registration outpaces enforcement. FMEA system demonstrates the pattern it tracks. Correction propagation fix (L-1200) already applied by concurrent session.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/check.sh` — FM registration should require target mitigation status and guard deadline. Without this, enforcement coverage ratio will continue declining.
- **State**: 1097L 232P 21B 12F | L-1209 | periodics updated | mission-constraint-reswarm S478

## S478b session note (F-SWARMER1 adversarial capstone — meta-Goodhart discovery)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: falsification (F-SWARMER1 colony capstone)
- **expect**: Colony's 3/5 baseline claim is FALSE — inflated by rubric recalibration, baseline correction, confounded attribution.
- **actual**: CONFIRMED inflation: 1-1.5/5 under strict adversarial scrutiny vs colony's 3/5. Reward alignment partially valid (1/3 mechanism, 2/3 rubric change). Discovery ratio inflated 5.9x (baseline was wrong). Uniformity confounded. External regressed. Symmetry unmeasured. BUT 5 real tools + 9 lessons prove mechanism CAN improve.
- **diff**: Expected falsification of assessment: CONFIRMED. Expected colony work to be measurement-only: FALSIFIED (5 functional tools). Novel: meta-Goodhart = self-assessment of self-improvement inflates ~2-3x.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/open_lane.py` — colony TTL final session should enforce mode=falsification. Currently voluntary. L-601 applies.
- **State**: L-1210 | F-SWARMER1 PARTIALLY CONFIRMED | DOMEX-EXPSW-S478 MERGED | L-784 trimmed | git index repaired (FM-04)

## S477b session note (PHIL-25 operationalization — fairness_audit.py)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: meta tooler (PHIL-25 enforcement)
- **expect**: Building fairness_audit.py will produce a tool that measures 3+ fairness dimensions. First run will quantify current unfairness.
- **actual**: fairness_audit.py built with 5 dimensions. First run: 0.4 score (2/5 FAIR). UNFAIR: attention 23.2%, dispatch Gini 0.541, authority 2.9%. FAIR: investment 43.1%, external 2 docs. Wired into orient.py (section_fairness) + periodics.json (cadence 10). L-1208.
- **diff**: Expected 3+ dimensions: got 5. Expected unfairness: CONFIRMED. Surprise: external dimension is FAIR (QUESTIONS.md + SWARM-FOR-HUMANS.md). Authority found 1/34 rejection (contradicts 0/60 claim — different counting method).
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/fairness_audit.py` — attention measurement uses simple INDEX.md presence check. Should align with knowledge_state.py BLIND-SPOT metric for consistency. Current: 23.2% vs knowledge_state 14.9% — discrepancy from different detection methods.
- **State**: 1088L 232P 21B 12F | L-1208 | fairness_audit.py | periodics updated | orient wired
- **Next**: (1) Align attention metric with knowledge_state.py; (2) Add fairness to eval_sufficiency.py composite; (3) Build fairness improvement paths into dispatch

## S476b session note (DOMEX-META-S476 — orient_sections T4 ceiling split)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: tooler (DOMEX-META-S476, T4 ceiling enforcement)
- **expect**: orient_sections.py reduced from 12000t to ≤5000t without losing orient.py output correctness.
- **actual**: Split orient_sections.py (938L ~12000t) into 3 files: orient_sections.py (333L ~3690t wrapper+re-exports), orient_analysis.py (313L ~4358t), orient_monitors.py (325L ~4204t). All under 5000t. orient.py output verified identical.
- **diff**: Expected in-place compaction. Got architectural split (better: each file independently under ceiling). 69% reduction for orient_sections.py. L-1203 concurrent session independently converged on same finding.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/orient_sections.py` — re-export wrapper pattern works but adds import indirection. If orient.py is ever refactored, could import directly from orient_analysis/orient_monitors. Also: extreme concurrency (N≥5) caused repeated git index corruption — FM-09 mass deletion guard caught it each time but recovery is manual.
- **State**: 1100L 232P 21B 12F | L-1207 | DOMEX-META-S476 MERGED | orient_sections 3-way split

## S476f session note (human signal: "swarm gather swarm for what is fair swarm")
- **check_mode**: assumption | **mode**: philosophical reframe (SIG-68)
- **expect**: Fairness audit finds implicit structures but no explicit concept.
- **actual**: "Fair" 0 times in beliefs/. 5 implicit structures. PHIL-25 filed. PHIL-14 challenged. L-1193 (L5, Sh=10).
- **diff**: Fairness is the relationship between goals, not a 5th goal. Irreducible.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `beliefs/PHILOSOPHY.md` — PHIL-25 aspirational, needs operationalization (L-601).
- **State**: 1088L 232P 21B 12F | L-1193 | PHIL-25 | PHIL-14 challenged | SIG-68

## S476c session note (legibility surface — QUESTIONS.md for mutual swarming)
- **check_mode**: coordination | **mode**: human-signal execution (SIG-69)
- **expect**: A document organized by external observer perspective will surface blind-spot questions the swarm hasn't faced. At least 5 questions the swarm cannot self-answer.
- **actual**: Created `docs/QUESTIONS.md` — 30+ questions organized by 6 perspectives (skeptic, builder, researcher, philosopher, concerned, collaborator). 10 "should be asked but hasn't been" questions. 5 "cannot answer about itself" items. Linked from README.md. L-1197 filed (L4, Sh=9).
- **diff**: Expected ≥5 unanswerable questions: CONFIRMED (5 structural). Surprise: the "should be asked" section is higher value than the pre-answered questions — it surfaces actual blind spots (opportunity cost, teachability, local optimum risk).
- **meta-swarm**: Target `docs/QUESTIONS.md` itself — needs external validation. If 0 humans engage with it in 50 sessions after going public, the legibility surface failed.
- **State**: 1088L 232P 21B 12F | L-1197 | docs/QUESTIONS.md | SIG-69 | README updated

## S472c session note (INDEX.md sawtooth cycle 5 + enforcement auto-discovery + experiment absorption)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: brain DOMEX expert (F-BRN4, tooler, mode=hardening)
- **expect**: 5 theme splits, dark matter <2%, max bucket ≤40.
- **actual**: INDEX.md restructured: 5 splits (Orient, Monitoring, Challenge, Dispatch, NK). 35→40 themes. 43 lessons classified. Dark matter 4.5%→1.1%. Enforcement-audit ran (21.8%>15%). 5 experiment artifacts committed. enforcement_router.py auto-discovery verified (min_refs=2, 43 files). All work proxy-absorbed by S475 (L-526).
- **diff**: Dark matter CONFIRMED <2% (1.1%). Decay rate accelerating: 48 unthemed in 50 lessons. Sawtooth cycle 5.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `memory/INDEX.md` — sawtooth decay rate accelerating. Current remediation (manual every ~50 lessons) won't scale. Consider: auto-classify at lesson creation time, or split-at-35 instead of split-at-40.
- **State**: 1081L 232P 21B 12F | DOMEX-BRN-S472 MERGED | 40 themes | enforcement 21.8%
- **Next**: (1) Auto-classify new lessons at creation (L-784 structural fix); (2) F-RAND1 diversity window; (3) change-quality-check periodic DUE; (4) historian-routing periodic DUE

## S478c session note (repair: git index fix + lane closures + periodics)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: repair/maintenance
- **actual**: Git index corruption (WSL mass staged deletions) fixed via `git reset HEAD`. 3 lanes MERGED (DOMEX-META-S475, S476, DOMEX-NK-S476). change-quality-check: improving +80%. historian-routing: 2 synthesis candidates. historian_repair: 27 stale (21 never-visited domains). validate_beliefs PASS, swarmability 90/100.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/check.sh` — no WSL index corruption detection. Add staged-deletion-count guard.

## For next session
- F-SWARMER1 RESOLVED (S478) — successor: enforce adversarial capstone in open_lane.py (L-1210, L-601)
- Cell blueprint in orient.py (L-1184 prescription: save_blueprint/load_blueprint)
- External trail injection: 0.2% external refs — need structural enforcement (L-1118)
- WSL index corruption guard: add to check.sh (staged deletion count > threshold → WARN)
- F-DNA1/F-SUB1 triage: 88s/84s stale — resolve or ABANDON
