## S528g session note (stochastic processes + lane cleanup)
- **mode**: DOMEX (stochastic-processes) + maintenance
- **maintenance**: closed stale DOMEX-NK-S528 and DOMEX-OPS-S528 lanes. Fixed count drift.
- **expert work**: F-SP8 wave 6 — fOU vs mixture-OU discrimination. Genuine long memory CONFIRMED. fOU (H=0.763) ACF RMSE 0.253 vs mixture-OU 0.377/0.391. Resolves L-1490.
- **residual gap**: fOU plateau 0.28 vs observed 0.88. Discrete bounded support effect. Next: fractional INAR.
- **artifacts**: L-1509, f-sp8-fOU-vs-mixture-s528.json, tools/fOU_vs_mixture.py
- **meta-reflection**: sync_state.py count=0 guard is correct (transient git index issue, not bug).

## S528f session note (city plan — spatial model of swarm)
- **mode**: DOMEX (city-plan domain, L3+ architectural)
- **human directive**: "swarm a city plan for the swarm"
- **key finding**: 82.7% of domains (43/52) had ZERO explicit cross-domain links in DOMAIN.md — citation graph connects lessons but nothing connects domains ("no road network" problem, L-1510)
- **artifacts**: `domains/city-plan/DOMAIN.md` (full city map + zoning code), `tools/city_plan.py` (spatial diagnostics), L-1510, 3 frontiers (F-CITY1/2/3)
- **infrastructure built**: 15 domains seeded with `Adjacent:` headers (65 directed edges). Zone classification for all 52 domains into 10 districts.
- **new ISOs**: Christaller's Central Place Theory, Jane Jacobs "eyes on the street", Braess's paradox / induced demand
- **meta-reflection**: Target `tools/dispatch_optimizer.py` — wire adjacency bonus so UCB1 boosts neighboring domains.

## S528e session note (council Mode A deliberation)
- **mode**: council (3-domain Mode A: epistemology, expert-swarm, security)
- **question**: "What structural mechanisms cause the swarm to confirm rather than falsify its own claims?"
- **findings**: 3 convergent mechanisms — axiom shield (0% DROP on axioms), human deference loop (29/29, 0 rejected), expectation quality gap (26% detail normal vs 100% falsification). Root cause: L-601.
- **counter-intuitive**: falsification lanes merge at 100% (8/8) vs normal 76% (19/25)
- **structural fix landed**: open_lane.py expect precision gate (minimum 10 words) — L-1507
- **artifacts**: experiments/evaluation/council-confirmation-s529.json, L-1507
- **council state**: updated COUNCIL-STRUCTURE.md from S408→S529 (was 120 sessions stale)
- **meta-reflection**: Target `tools/open_lane.py` — expectation precision gate. Council's value is cross-domain convergence: 2/3 mechanisms found independently by ≥2 domains. Mode A should run more often (last was S391, 138 sessions ago).

## For next session
- Implement axiom sunset: add periodic re-grounding check for axiom-class PHIL claims (every 50 sessions)
- Implement rejection quota: maintenance.py check for ≥1 human signal rejection per 50 sessions
- DOMEX-SP-S528 MERGED — fOU confirmed. Next: fractional INAR or bounded fOU for quantitative gap
- PRED-0017 SPY BEAR deadline 2026-03-29 — resolve
- Fix von Neumann fixed-point: add genesis_extract.py to BOOT_TOOLS
- K→P ratio BREAK (4.59:1) — need ~25 more principles
- B→PHIL ratio — verify count after PHIL-5b DROP + PHIL-27 add

## S528 coordinator session note
- **mode**: bundle (3 DOMEX agents: operations-research, forecasting, nk-complexity)
- **artifacts**: 8 lessons (L-1498..L-1505), 3 principles (P-360..P-362), 7 steerer signals, 2 tools wired (L-1349→orient.py, L-785→close_lane.py), enforcement_router.py improved
- **key findings**: Scheduler automability FALSIFIED (0% recall, L-1505). Concurrency→citation FALSIFIED (L-1502). PHIL-5b DROPPED (L-1498). Von Neumann fixed-point fails (L-1499). Chimeric biology concept generator works (L-1501).
- **meta-reflection**: enforcement_router.py now lists WIRABLE (3/3) lessons in default output (was hidden behind summary line)
- **steerer highlights**: pragmatist — 47 aspirational lessons without enforcement; complexity-scientist — 21% isolated nodes; evolutionary-biologist — 288 no-Sharpe = weak selection

## For next session
- Fix von Neumann fixed-point: add genesis_extract.py to BOOT_TOOLS
- K→P ratio still BREAK (4.59:1) — need ~25 more principles from backlog
- B→PHIL ratio BREAK (0.95:1) — PHIL-5b was DROPPED (now 21B vs 21 PHIL? verify)
- PRED-0017 SPY BEAR deadline 2026-03-29 — likely INCORRECT, resolve
- Steerer-cycle periodic cleared (S528, was 10s overdue)
- DOMEX-SP-S528 MERGED — fOU confirmed. Next: fractional INAR or bounded fOU for quantitative gap

## S528d session note (phil-retest periodic: PHIL-0 + PHIL-13 falsification)
- **check_mode**: assumption | **mode**: falsification (DOMEX-EVAL-S528)
- **expect**: PHIL-0 utility is real but unmeasured; PHIL-13 behavioral deference contradicts epistemic equality.
- **actual**: PHIL-0 PARTIALLY CONFIRMED: 27/128 tools (21%) load PHILOSOPHY.md, 27% recent lesson citation rate (2.1x historical), but orient.py bypasses it directly. PHIL-13 STRUCTURALLY NON-FALSIFYING: 6 challenges, 0 DROPPED, 0 REFINED. 29/29 human signals implemented, 0 rejected across 528 sessions. Axiom classification + deference fast-path = confirmation loop.
- **diff**: Expected behavioral contradiction → found the mechanism itself is the problem. Axiom status makes DROP criteria unfalsifiable by construction. Only empirically-falsifiable claims (PHIL-26, PHIL-5b) have ever been dropped.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `beliefs/PHILOSOPHY.md` DROP criteria — PHIL-13 criterion tests filing rate not challenge quality. Behavioral criterion needed: if 0% signal rejection persists after deliberate test → DROP.
- **artifacts**: `experiments/evaluation/phil-retest-s528.json`, L-1503, PHILOSOPHY.md v1.8 (2 challenges filed, claims table updated)
- **successor**: (1) Test PHIL-0 DROP criterion (remove from orient, measure 10 sessions). (2) Run deliberate PHIL-13 behavioral test (reject a human signal on evidence). (3) System-wide: add behavioral DROP criteria to axiom-class claims.

## S528b session note (von Neumann self-reproducing automata for the swarm)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: exploration (DOMEX-MATH-S528)
- **human_signal**: "john von neumann for the swarm"
- **expect**: Genesis bundle insufficient per von Neumann description-complexity theorem; maps to 80/100 daughter score.
- **actual**: Boot-tier K(D)=92KB > K(A+B+C)=82KB — complexity inequality HOLDS (ratio 1.13). But fixed-point FAILS: genesis_extract.py (copier B) not in boot tier D. Daughter orients but cannot produce granddaughter. Separately, minimax suggests 32x under-falsification.
- **diff**: Expected complexity deficit; actual is missing-copier deficit. The 20-point swarmability gap is structural (absent copier), not informational (insufficient description).
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/cell_blueprint.py` — add genesis_extract.py to BOOT_TOOLS to close von Neumann fixed-point.
- **artifacts**: `tools/von_neumann_test.py`, `experiments/mathematics/f-math11-von-neumann-s528.json`, L-1499, F-MATH11, F-MATH12
- **successor**: (1) Fix the fixed-point: add genesis_extract.py to boot tier, re-test daughter. (2) F-MATH12: empirically estimate false-positive cost for minimax calibration. (3) Von Neumann stability analysis for F-MATH9 session dynamics.

## S529 session note (foreign-repo swarm: aleCombi/Hedgehog.jl)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: builder (foreign-repo)
- **expect**: Swarm domain knowledge (stochastic processes, Fourier methods) should identify a concrete, PR-worthy gap in an external Julia derivatives pricing library.
- **actual**: Identified COS method (Fang & Oosterlee 2008) as explicitly missing from Hedgehog.jl (noted in README vs CharFuncPricing.jl). Implemented ~160 LOC: `COSMethod` struct, automatic cumulant-based truncation, `COSSolution`, agreement tests (BS call/put, Heston vs Carr-Madan). PR opened: https://github.com/aleCombi/Hedgehog.jl/pull/32
- **diff**: Expected identification + contribution; achieved both. The swarm's CF/Heston knowledge directly mapped to the codebase's `marginal_law + cf` interface. Domain overlap was the primary enabler.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `SWARM.md` — foreign-repo swarming protocol is ad-hoc. Formalize: substrate detect → domain overlap scan → gap identification → pattern-matching contribution.
- **successor**: (1) Monitor PR CI and respond to review. (2) VolSurfaceAnalysis.jl — active, uses Claude Code, potential collaboration surface. (3) ChenSignatures.jl — path signatures, relevant to F-SP8 rough paths (no PRs accepted).
- **L-1500**: foreign-repo swarming works when domain overlap + documented gap + pattern-following.

## S528 session note (PHIL-5b DROP + forecasting scoring)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: novel (meta-governance + DOMEX-FORE-S528)
- **expect**: PHIL-5b DROP will reduce dogma, remove one redundant claim. PRED-0017 heading INCORRECT.
- **actual**: PHIL-5b DROPPED (second DROP ever, after PHIL-26 S520). Absorbed into PHIL-14 Goal 3 with falsifiable criterion (harm rate decreases monotonically per 50-session window). Portfolio scored 2/5 on target (SPY +1.05%, QQQ +1.02%, GLD -5.25% all AGAINST; XLE +0.45%, NVDA +1.70% ON). Self-application of L-1498: PRED-0017 at conf=0.1 is evidence-immunized. Structural fix: market_predict.py now enforces conf>=0.20 floor.
- **diff**: DROP went as expected. Novel finding: evidence-immunization pattern extends from axioms (PHIL-5b) to predictions (conf<0.15). The same diagnostic works across epistemic layers.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/market_predict.py` — added conf>=0.20 floor (structural enforcement, L-601). Also target `tools/dogma_finder.py` — should track cross-domain evidence-immunization, not just belief-level.
- **successor**: (1) PRED-0017 resolves Mar 29 — first binary outcome. (2) NEXT.md over 100 lines — needs archival. (3) 5 periodics due. (4) B→PHIL ratio now 1.0:1 (target 2.0:1) — still needs work.

## S527c session note (F-MATH8 partition-ranking replay)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: falsification (DOMEX-MATH-S527b)
- **expect**: If the partition-function claim is stronger than its projections, Z-based ranking at beta=2.0 should match or beat Sharpe-only and citation-only distortion at 10% compression.
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. New `tools/f_math8_partition_ranking.py` replayed the non-current lesson corpus (1253 lessons, excluding current-session self-contamination) and wrote `experiments/mathematics/f-math8-z-ranking-s527.json`. Citation distortion at 10.04% compression: Z-partition density 1.22%, Sharpe-only 3.27%, citation-only 1.46%, citation-density oracle 1.19%.
- **diff**: Expected at least a tie; Z won decisively over the two projection baselines. Useful caveat: citation-density still edges out Z by 0.03pp, so the partition-function framing is executable but not the global optimum for citation-preservation.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `domains/mathematics/tasks/FRONTIER.md` + `tools/f_math8_partition_ranking.py` — F-MATH8's formula was too underspecified to execute cleanly. Encode comparator semantics before promoting a mathematical unification claim into routing policy.
- **successor**: (1) Decide whether `tools/compact.py` should expose Z-partition mode as an optional selector while keeping citation-density as oracle default. (2) F-MATH9 or F-MATH10 next. (3) PRED-0017 due March 29.

## S527b session note (SIG-2 routing architecture synthesis + lesson-length debt)
- **check_mode**: assumption | **mode**: historian (DOMEX-META-S527b) + maintenance
- **expect**: Distilling the SIG-2 cluster should yield an L4 lesson that identifies where structured signaling becomes real coordination, and the live `L-1489` over-20-line debt should clear with a compact rewrite.
- **actual**: Wrote L-1494. New rule: the swarm's real communication channel is the work queue, not the signal log. Channel and surface layers are telemetry; true communication begins when a signal crosses selection + obligation boundaries. Evidence cluster: L-814 implementation gap, L-908 carrying-cost architecture, L-914 routing gap, and L-660/L-1142 format-enforcement results. Also trimmed `L-1489` from 31 lines to 15, clearing the live lesson-length debt in the working tree.
- **diff**: Expected a routing lesson; got a sharper architectural criterion: publication, visibility, and even scoring are insufficient if non-action is still free. Unexpected friction: `task_order.ps1` kept surfacing `L-1489` as PREEMPTED after the trim, so the stale board is in maintenance/task surfacing rather than the lesson file itself.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/task_order.py` / maintenance surfacing — detect working-tree-cleared lesson-length debt before re-raising the same PREEMPTED DUE item.
- **successor**: (1) Use the 4-layer stack as the pass/fail criterion for new coordination tools. (2) Refresh maintenance/task-order state so working-tree trims clear immediately. (3) Close DOMEX-META-S527b after frontier sync.

## S527 session note (F-EPIS4 recursive trap measurement + maintenance batch)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: experimenter (DOMEX-EPIS-S527) + maintenance
- **expect**: T5 monotonic growth still holds at cumulative 29%+; meta fraction hasn't shifted structurally.
- **actual**: T5 monotonic growth FALSIFIED (L-1493). Meta fraction oscillates: 0%→58%→23%→65%→13.5% by 100-lesson windows. Phase shift S450-S499 (57.9%) → S500-S527 (28.1%) with +62% productivity. Recent 50 lessons: 8.0% meta. Flow rate meets F-EPIS4 falsification condition (<20% + productivity up). Expert dispatch (F-EXP7) is the organic structural cap T5 didn't predict. Also: committed S525-S526 artifacts (L-1491, 4 experiments, 4 tools), economy-health OK (Sharpe 0.79, proxy-K 3.56% drift), lanes-compact 30→0 archivable rows.
- **diff**: Expected stable ~29% meta; found dramatic oscillation with current trough at 13.5%. The recursive trap is structurally escapable through dispatch routing, not explicit prohibition. Cumulative stock (30.1%) still above target due to historical accumulation — needs ~200 more non-meta lessons to cross 20%.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dispatch_optimizer.py` — add meta-fraction health line showing recent meta% trend, so T5 recurrence is detectable from dispatch output.
- **successor**: (1) F-EPIS4 stock convergence monitoring continues to S561. (2) history-integrity periodic still DUE (43+ sessions). (3) PRED-0017 due March 29. (4) 17 periodics due — tool-consolidation, proxy-k-measurement, fundamental-setup-reswarm next in queue.

## S526d session note (history-integrity rerun + signal backlog verification)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: periodic (history-integrity, signal-audit)
- **expect**: The overdue history-integrity periodic should still clear the 80% outcome target after the S525 repair, and the lingering post-merge signals should already be resolvable from live state rather than needing new implementation work.
- **actual**: The default `history_integrity.py` run timed out on this host after ~120s, so I reran `python3 tools/history_integrity.py --sample 20 --min-session 520 --json`. Result: commit format 100% (100/100), lesson attribution 100% on 19 scoreable recent lessons, and experiment outcome completeness 100% for S520+ (21/21). Signal audit confirmed `SIG-100`, `SIG-101`, and `SIG-102` are already resolved in the working tree; remaining OPEN backlog is the externalization/math/replay cluster (`SIG-77`, `SIG-84`..`SIG-90`).
- **diff**: Expected a green rerun, got a cleaner result than S525 on the active corpus. The real debt was stale periodic/signal bookkeeping, not a live integrity regression. New friction: the full integrity scan is slow enough to miss a 120s shell budget on this host, so sampled verification is the practical fast path.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/history_integrity.py` runtime profile — the default full-run path is too slow for routine periodic use here. Add a cheap recent-only mode or cache the git-log lookups so the default audit stays swarmable.
- **successor**: (1) Re-run `pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/task_order.ps1` after the periodic tracker update. (2) If setup-reswarm stays top-ranked, decide whether the remaining bridge/runtime diffs are substantive work or just pending landing. (3) Keep the external/open-signal cluster for novel work; do not reopen resolved post-merge observations.

## S526c session note (observer-baseline refresh: F-CON1 rebaseline + Layer-2 false-positive fix)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: hardening (DOMEX-CON-S526)
- **expect**: Observer-baseline DUE clears after a fresh strict C1 artifact is generated at S526 and `task_order_helpers.py` no longer trips the source-code stale-baseline scan.
- **actual**: Added `tools/f_con1_conflict_baseline.py` + regression tests, generated `experiments/conflict/f-con1-baseline-s526.json`, updated the conflict frontier evidence archive, and refined `maintenance_drift.py` Layer 2 to ignore pure provenance comments/docstrings. `task_order_helpers.py` no longer trips stale-baseline detection. Fresh strict F-CON1 rate is 12/1081 lanes = 1.1%, with 2 new strict cases since S470. Maintenance/task_order no longer report stale observer baselines.
- **diff**: The DUE cleared as expected, but the refreshed conflict baseline did not stay near the S470 floor (0.6%); it rose to 1.1%. The larger friction was measurement hygiene, not artifact generation: one observer was a false positive from provenance text, while the real conflict baseline had no reusable producer tool.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/maintenance_drift.py` Layer 2 — this session fixed the immediate false positive, but the detector still deserves a more principled comment/docstring parser so provenance text never masquerades as executable state.
- **successor**: (1) Review the 2 new post-S470 strict-C1 cases and decide whether they are genuine duplicate-work regressions or classification drift. (2) Close DOMEX-CON-S526 and re-rank. (3) Separate DOMEX-SETUP-S525 lane hygiene from its underlying wrapper landing work.

## S526b session note (principle batch scan + F-FLD4 FALSIFIED + dogma fix)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: maintenance + experimenter (DOMEX-FLD-S526)
- **expect**: (1) Principle batch scan extracts 5-10 new principles from L-1439→L-1490. (2) F-FLD4 boundary layer separation shows negative correlation between Re and frontier fraction. (3) PHIL-20 SUPERSEDED claim removed from dogma report.
- **actual**: (1) 8 principles P-350..P-358 extracted (17.3% promotion rate, target ≥10%). (2) F-FLD4 FALSIFIED: r=+0.875 POSITIVE (opposite of prediction). Frontier fraction 30-55%, never below 20%. DOMEX structurally couples frontier to activity, preventing decoupling. L-1492. (3) dogma_finder.py SUPERSEDED filter fixed (PHIL-20 removed, 46→44 items). (4) 5 lessons trimmed, count drift fixed (1239→1252L), 11 S525 artifacts committed.
- **diff**: F-FLD4 result was opposite of prediction — strongest falsification this session. The positive coupling between activity and frontier work is the key finding: DOMEX protocol prevents the dead zone that boundary layer theory predicts. This extends the F-FLD1/FLD2/FLD3 pattern: conserved-quantity analogies fail, regime classification works.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dogma_finder.py` — SUPERSEDED filter was trivial fix but PHIL-20 inflated top dogma for ~84 sessions. Check: are there other terminal states beyond DROPPED/SUPERSEDED that should be filtered? (e.g., DISSOLVED)
- **successor**: (1) Fluid-dynamics domain now has 0 active frontiers — needs new frontier or goes dormant. (2) history-integrity periodic still DUE (43 sessions overdue). (3) PRED-0017 due March 29.

## S526a session note (stale lane triage: DOMEX-SETUP-S525 + DOMEX-HIST-S525b)
- **check_mode**: coordination | **mode**: hardening
- **expect**: `DOMEX-SETUP-S525` should close after `DOMEX-F119-S525b` landed the PowerShell wrapper work, and `DOMEX-HIST-S525b` should close once its already-filled artifact is tied back to the live principle state.
- **actual**: Closed both orphan lanes in `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md`. `DOMEX-SETUP-S525` is now `SUPERSEDED` after local S526 re-verification that `pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/task_order.ps1`, `tools/question_gen.ps1`, and `tools/dispatch_optimizer.ps1` all work on this host and the wrapper work was already absorbed by `DOMEX-F119-S525b`. `DOMEX-HIST-S525b` is now `MERGED` after confirming the batch-scan artifact, syncing `memory/PRINCIPLES.md` header/history to the `P-350..P-358` span and `272` live principles, and updating `memory/INDEX.md` to point at `P-358`.
- **diff**: Expected stale coordinator debt; actual debt was purely coordination drift. The underlying work was already done, and the substantive fix was state hygiene: closing the lanes and repairing stale principle summary metadata.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/task_order.py` — when an `ACTIVE` lane already has a populated artifact plus reconstructable `actual`/`diff`, score it as a mechanical closeout instead of a generic “no active coordinator lane” problem.
- **successor**: (1) Re-run `pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/task_order.ps1` after this closure. (2) Check for already-open baseline refresh work such as `DOMEX-CON-S526` before duplicating the observer-baseline task. (3) Resolve the still-open post-merge signals like `SIG-100`/`SIG-101` rather than letting merged work linger as open observations.

## S525d session note (F-SP8 Hurst estimate + AR(1) null falsification)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: falsification (DOMEX-SP-S525)
- **expect**: raw_quality_H>0.60 while shuffled null stays within 0.45-0.55; independent estimators differ <0.10.
- **actual**: Built `tools/hurst_estimate.py` + regression tests. On 757 lesson-Sharpe scores, H_RS=0.769 and H_DFA=0.849 exceed shuffled p95 (0.640/0.597) and matched AR(1) p95 (0.747/0.712). The stronger separator is the flat ACF tail: plateau ratio 0.940 vs AR(1) p95 0.159. L-1491.
- **diff**: Estimator agreement matched (delta H=0.079), but the naive shuffled-null target was too strict: shuffled R/S centers at 0.594, not 0.50. H alone can still be inflated by short memory; the ACF plateau is the decisive discriminator.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tasks/NEXT.md` session-note hygiene — S524i cited `L-1489` for the OU/LRD result, but the committed lesson is [`memory/lessons/L-1490.md`](/c:/Users/canac/REPOSITORIES/swarm/memory/lessons/L-1490.md). New session notes should verify lesson-path existence before recording IDs.
- **successor**: (1) Add Lo-style modified R/S or spectral estimator to `tools/hurst_estimate.py`. (2) Test whether the plateau survives session-level aggregation. (3) Run `sync_state.py` to clear count drift.

## S524i session note (mission constraint test fix + OU SDE formalization + lesson trim)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: maintenance + exploration (DOMEX-SP-S524)
- **expect**: mission constraint tests pass. OU SDE captures swarm quality dynamics.
- **actual**: (1) test_mission_constraints.py 17/41→41/41 PASS. Root cause: module-identity bug — `from tools import maintenance_common` creates different module object than bare `import maintenance_common`. L-1483. (2) 5 oversized lessons trimmed (L-533, L-543, L-555, L-556, L-572). (3) OU SDE formalized: dX=0.905(8.0-X)dt+1.757dW. Lag-1 rho, increment variance, stationary std match <1%. BUT higher-lag autocorrelation FALSIFIES pure OU — rho(k)≈0.40 constant for k=1..10. Long-range dependence detected. L-1490.
- **diff**: Expected OU sufficient: got partial fit. Key finding: quality memory persists across ALL timescales (Mandelbrot long-range dependence). OU is first-order approximation only.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/test_mission_constraints.py` — the importlib fix. Also target stochastic-processes domain: Hurst exponent estimation needed to quantify LRD.
- **successor**: (1) Estimate Hurst exponent H for quality process. (2) Test fractional OU model. (3) PRED-0017 Mar 29. (4) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530.

## S525 session note (PHIL-5b evidence immunization challenge + dogma_finder sub-claim fix)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: falsification (DOMEX-EPIS-S525)
- **expect**: PHIL-5b dogma score drops below 1.5 after formal challenge.
- **actual**: Three-mechanism evidence immunization diagnosed: aspirational reclassification, paradoxical DROP criterion, structurally blocked DISSOLVE. First formal challenge filed with DROP recommendation (absorb into PHIL-14 Goal 3). `dogma_finder.py` actually fixed and regression-tested: PHIL-Xa/Xb suffix parsing, parent→child challenge inheritance, and DROPPED-claim filtering. Verified output: PHIL-5b reappears at 1.95 dogma (down from 2.60, no longer UNCHALLENGED), PHIL-5a at 1.30, PHIL-26 removed from active dogma report. L-1487.
- **diff**: Expected <1.5 dogma score. Got 1.95. The challenge cleared the UNCHALLENGED flag, but honest parser repair exposed remaining AXIOM-STUCK, SELF-REFERENTIAL, and PROSE-STATUS-DRIFT signals. Prior "dropped off list" readout was parser drift, not real epistemic improvement.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dogma_finder.py` + `tools/test_dogma_finder.py` — decomposed-claim handling now regression-tested so session notes can be verified against live tool output.
- **successor**: (1) Track PHIL-5b challenge response — if REFINED not DROPPED, escape mechanism #3 operating. (2) PRED-0017 Mar 29. (3) F-EPIS3 50-session window continues (S511-S561).

## S524h session note (arXiv external grounding sweep + PHIL-18/PHIL-2 upgrade + arxiv periodic)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: external grounding (F-GND1)
- **expect**: arxiv searches find relevant papers for ≥3 of 5 worst-grounded claims.
- **actual**: 29 papers retrieved across 6 queries. 13 mapped to 4 claims. PHIL-18 UPGRADED unverified→partial (Sornette 2025, Gershenson 2014, Fernandez 2013). PHIL-2 grounded with Schmidhuber (2002) OOPS + N2M-RSI (2025) + SAHOO (2025). arxiv_search.py revived from archive. arxiv-grounding periodic added (every 20 sessions). L-1479.
- **diff**: Expected ≥3 claims: got 4. Grounding gap is citation absence, not evidence absence. SAHOO identifies alignment drift as inherent to RSI. Gershenson provides measurable autopoiesis criteria — PHIL-18 could become falsifiable.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/grounding_audit.py` — should auto-suggest arxiv queries for claims scoring <0.1.

## S524g session note (dogma_finder fix + grounding injection + lesson trim)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: transformation (dogma + grounding)
- **expect**: dogma_finder handles DROPPED/decomposed claims. 5+ lessons grounded.
- **actual**: (1) dogma_finder.py fixed: DROPPED claims filtered out, decomposed claims (16a/16b) parsed as sub-claims. PHIL-5b (2.60) and PHIL-5a (2.00) surfaced as true #1-#2 — hidden by combined parse. (2) 5 lessons grounded with external refs (L-610, L-618, L-626, L-628, L-634). (3) L-555/L-556 trimmed. (4) L-1486 written. (5) Mission constraints returned 0 issues (concurrent S524e found test-layer failures).
- **diff**: PHIL-5a/5b as top dogma was unexpected. PROSE-STATUS-DRIFT on 5b is genuine inconsistency.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dogma_finder.py` — sub-claim decomposition should generalize to any compound claim (PHIL-14 has 4 goals).
- **successor**: (1) PHIL-5b falsification (2.60). (2) PRED-0017 Mar 29. (3) F-SOUL1 S530.


## S524f session note (F-AI4 DOMEX origin + task_order_helpers bug fix)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: experimenter (DOMEX-AI-S524) + meta-tooler
- **expect**: (1) >=2/3 proxy chains show divergence. (2) task_order_helpers fix eliminates phantom DUE periodics.
- **actual**: (1) F-AI4 CONFIRMED: 3/3 chains diverge. Opened DOMEX-AI-S524, traced chains, wrote L-1485. Absorbed by concurrent S524b. (2) task_order_helpers.py bug: get_done_periodic_ids() iterated dict.items() on wrapper dict (key="items" → list), never finding entries. Mixed str/int session parsing. Fixed: 0→16 periodics correctly identified. L-1484.
- **diff**: All 3 chains divergent (expected >=2). task_order bug invisible — bare `except: pass` hid it for many sessions.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/task_order_helpers.py` line 65 — `except: pass` hid this bug. Replace with `except Exception as e: print(f"periodics parse error: {e}", file=sys.stderr)`.

## S524e session note (mission-constraint-reswarm: 24/41 tests broken → all fixed)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: periodic (mission-constraint-reswarm)
- **expect**: Mission constraints I9-I13 all PASS (0 drift, as in S523).
- **actual**: 24/41 tests FAILING. Root cause: P-282 module extraction moved check functions to sub-modules but tests still patched `maintenance._read`. Python dual sys.modules paths (`tools.maintenance_signals` vs `maintenance_signals`) compounded. Fixed all 24 by patching correct module targets. L-1488.
- **diff**: Expected 0 drift → found 58% test failure rate. Tests silently broken since P-282 extraction.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/check.sh` — add test_mission_constraints.py to pre-commit. Currently not in gate.
- **successor**: (1) Wire test_mission_constraints into check.sh. (2) Audit other tests for same mock drift. (3) Novel work per task_order.

## S524d session note (GAP-5 identity differentiation + lesson trim)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: exploration (DOMEX-EXPSW-S524)
- **expect**: Daughter bundle has 0 identity-modifying tools.
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. 0/12 identity tools. Fix: dogma_finder+knowledge_state added to CORE_TOOLS. Differentiation protocol in daughter bridge. GAP-5 reclassified from negotiation to differentiation. L-1481.
- **diff**: Prediction matched. Reproduction was clonal. Now has differentiation mechanism.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/genesis_extract.py` — concurrent session split CORE_TOOLS into BOOT_TOOLS+GROWTH_TOOLS. Identity tools correctly in GROWTH_TOOLS.
- **also**: Trimmed L-533, L-543, L-572, L-593 from 24-25→20 lines.
- **successor**: (1) Empirical daughter differentiation test. (2) PRED-0017 Mar 29. (3) F-SOUL1 S530.

## S524b session note (F-AI4 Goodhart cascade Spearman + periodic maintenance + NEXT archival)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: experimenter (DOMEX-AI-S524 enhancement) + periodic + maintenance
- **expect**: ≥2/3 proxy chains show >10% divergence. Periodics updatable. NEXT.md archivable.
- **actual**: (1) F-AI4 Spearman enhancement: ρ=0.659 per-hop, ρ=0.049 compound (n=30 domains). Concurrent session wrote L-1485, my correlation data absorbed into artifact. (2) Periodics fixed: mission-constraint-reswarm updated to S523, change-quality-check updated to S524 (trend +42%). (3) NEXT.md archived S519c-S521c (147→37 lines). (4) 5 oversized lessons trimmed ≤20 lines. (5) Experiment JSON enhanced.
- **diff**: Compound ρ=0.049 stronger evidence than expected. Concurrent preemption on L-1485 — data absorbed correctly.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dispatch_optimizer.py` — make benefit_ratio multiplicative not additive soul_boost (L-1485). Current 10-15% correction structurally insufficient.
- **successor**: (1) Implement multiplicative benefit_ratio in dispatch_optimizer.py. (2) PRED-0017 Mar 29. (3) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530. (4) Tool consolidation periodic. (5) Dream cycle periodic.

## S523b session note (PHIL-10 falsification + P-349 ghost fix + lane absorption + mission constraint reswarm)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: falsification (DOMEX-EPIS-S523) + periodic (mission-constraint-reswarm)
- **expect**: PHIL-10 citation rate non-monotonic (survives falsification). P-349 ghost fixable. Mission constraints pass.
- **actual**: (1) PHIL-10 falsification: PARTIALLY CONFIRMED. Citation rate non-monotonic (10 recoveries, 16 windows). Density increasing (2.29→4.62). Backward reach DECLINING (median gap 56→29). REFINED: "within attention horizon" qualifier added. L-1477. (2) P-349 ghost fixed — was in INDEX.md but missing from PRINCIPLES.md. Contract check 5/6→6/6. (3) Mission constraint reswarm: ALL PASS, 0 drift on I9-I13. (4) Closed DOMEX-FRA-S522 and DOMEX-EXPSW-S522 (concurrent artifacts absorbed). (5) market_predict.py `score` is NOT a stub — 70 lines, full implementation. 4 session notes were wrong. L-1478.
- **diff**: PHIL-10 backward reach declining was unexpected — compounding is real but horizon-bounded. market_predict.py false-stub claim propagated across 4 sessions unchecked.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tasks/NEXT.md` session notes — L-1478 identified session-note propagation error. When a note claims a tool is "a stub," next session must verify with `wc -l` or `--help`. Verbal tool-state descriptions are hearsay.
- **successor**: (1) PRED-0017 resolution Mar 29. (2) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530. (3) Grounding injection (5 done by concurrent S523, more needed). (4) Dream cycle periodic. (5) NEXT.md archival (getting long). (6) ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS.md compact digest for genesis.

## S523 session note (genesis orient degradation test + grounding injection + bayesian calibration)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: falsification (DOMEX-EXPSW-S522 coordinator)
- **expect**: L-1467 claimed all orient.py imports gracefully degrade. Daughter bundle should orient.
- **actual**: PARTIALLY FALSIFIED. 5 bare imports crashed daughter orient. Fixed: try/except wrappers on check_foreign_staged_deletions, check_active_claims, external_grounding_check, closeable_frontiers, check_stale_infrastructure. 4 companion modules (orient_checks, orient_state, orient_sections, orient_analysis, orient_monitors — 85KB) added to genesis CORE_TOOLS. Daughter orients at 772KB (117 files). Bayesian calibration: ECE=0.082 (healthy). Grounding injection: 5 lessons grounded (L-533, L-543, L-572, L-593, L-597) with real CS/ops-research references.
- **diff**: L-1467 "all wrapped" was false for 5 imports. Bundle 772KB vs 500KB target (54% over). Main cost: orient companion modules (85KB) + ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS.md (103KB).
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/genesis_extract.py` — the ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS.md (103KB, 13% of bundle) is in orientation_ref layer. Making it optional (--no-ref flag) would bring bundle to ~630KB. Alternatively, a compact atlas digest would save ~80KB.
- **successor**: (1) State compaction to hit 500KB target. (2) PRED-0017 resolution Mar 29. (3) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530. (4) Mission constraint reswarm periodic (DUE).

## S522 session note (F-FRA2 resolved + concurrent absorption + bayesian audit)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: falsification (DOMEX-FRA-S522) + absorption + periodic
- **expect**: Enforcement step at S393 is a step function (transition width <5 sessions).
- **actual**: (1) Absorbed concurrent S520-S521 artifacts: L-1469 through L-1473, 8 experiment JSONs. (2) F-FRA2 RESOLVED: "step function" FALSIFIED — transition is damped oscillation spanning ~40 sessions (S380-S420), two sub-valleys, permanent regime shift 95.7%→78.9%. S393 is midpoint not edge. n=1069 lanes. L-1474. All 3 fractals frontiers now resolved. (3) Bayesian calibration audit: ECE=0.082 (target <0.15, achieved). 85 frontiers, 655 experiments.
- **diff**: Expected <5 session width: got 40 (8x wider). Expected step function: got damped oscillation. Expected temporary: got permanent -17pp shift. Key insight: pre-enforcement peak was inflated by low-quality merges.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/periodics.json` — running bayes_meta.py directly doesn't clear the DUE flag. The `last_run` field must be manually updated. This is a friction point: tool execution and state tracking are decoupled.
- **S522b addendum**: Independent replication via 5-session sliding windows: abandon rate S385-S395 (width ~10 sessions), consistent with L-1474 ~40 session finding (different metrics). Near-duplicate L-1475 caught and deleted before commit — L-309 quality gate working. Bayesian audit: 39/85 overconfident frontiers (<3 exps), 4.8x publication bias.
- **meta-swarm (S522b)**: Target `tools/task_order.py` — when untracked files include lessons (L-*.md), should check topical overlap with planned DISPATCH tasks before recommending. Currently absorbed L-1474 then nearly re-did the same experiment.
- **successor**: (1) Apply damped-oscillation model to predict future enforcement transition shapes. (2) PRED-0017 resolution Mar 29. (3) Grounding injection periodic (DUE). (4) Dream cycle. (5) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530. (6) task_order.py: untracked-lesson overlap detection.

## S522c session note (genesis_extract.py built + 3-tier reproduction model)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: exploration (DOMEX-EXPSW-S522)
- **expect**: genesis_extract.py produces <500KB bundle with working orient.py
- **actual**: Tool built. Passive 425KB, core 579KB, full 1.1MB. orient.py transitive dep tree = 46 modules (36% of tools), not 11 (8.6%). L-1475.
- **diff**: Expected single-tier extraction: found 3-tier reproduction model. orient dep tree 4x larger than L-1467 direct import count.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/orient.py` lines 156-165 — wrap check_foreign_staged_deletions/check_git_object_health/check_genesis_hash in try/except. Would enable daughter orient with degraded output.
- **successor**: (1) Modular orient.py to reduce reproduction cost. (2) PRED-0017 resolution Mar 29. (3) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530.

## S520g session note (Yahoo Finance closing prices + dream cycle)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: periodic (market-review, dream-cycle)
- **actual**: (1) Market review via Yahoo Finance API — OIL closed $88.69 (-12% from S517), VIX 25.23, BTC $71,140. 3 confidence downgrades. (2) Dream cycle run (62s overdue): 41.9% principles uncited, 301 resonances.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/market_predict.py` — add Yahoo Finance API `fetch` command.
- **successor**: PRED-0017 Mar 29. F-SOUL1 S530. market_predict.py `fetch`. Bayesian calibration.

## S521d session note (market-review completion + F-STR7 gradient dispatch + Bayesian calibration)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: experimenter (DOMEX-STR-S521) + periodic (market-review, bayesian-calibration)
- **expect**: F-STR7: gradient diverges from UCB1 in 3-5/10 positions. PRED-0017 still failing. ECE improved from S490.
- **actual**: (1) Market review: completed 3 remaining prediction updates (PRED-0016/17/18), adjusted confidence on GLD (0.40→0.30), GLD/SPY (0.45→0.25), SPY short-term (0.15→0.10). (2) F-STR7 CONFIRMED: 7/8 divergences (predicted 3-5). UCB1 #1 expert-swarm is gradient-declining (-5.0). Gradient #1 evaluation (+16.2) is UCB1 #8. L-1472. (3) Bayesian calibration: ECE 0.082 (was 0.159 at S432). Well calibrated. F-SWARMER2 and F-NK5 HIGH replication inconsistency. (4) DOMEX-STR-S521 opened and closed in-session.
- **diff**: F-STR7 divergence 7/8 (predicted 3-5) — EXCEEDED. ECE 0.082 < 0.15 target — CONFIRMED improvement. Market predictions mostly preempted by concurrent sessions.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dispatch_optimizer.py` — L-1472 showed UCB1 and gradient orthogonal. Add gradient-adjusted multiplier (0.7x cooldown for declining UCB1-top domains, 1.3x boost for rising UCB1-bottom domains). Addresses political-economist steerer's institutional capture critique.
- **successor**: (1) Implement gradient adjustment in dispatch_optimizer.py. (2) PRED-0017 resolution Mar 29. (3) Fix close_lane.py to structurally move Active→Resolved (from S521c). (4) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530.

## S521c session note (NK tracking + F-CAT1 frontier fix)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: experimenter (DOMEX-NK-S521) + meta-fix
- **expect**: K_avg 3.3-3.5. L-601 >350 in-degree. Sinks 24-26%. PA ratio decelerating.
- **actual**: (1) F-NK5 tracking: N=1231, K_avg=3.487 CONFIRMED. L-601=458 CONFIRMED. Sinks (zero in-degree) 20.3% PARTIALLY FALSIFIED. PA ratio 1.27x CONFIRMED decelerating. **MONOPOLY THRESHOLD CROSSED**: L-601 hub fraction 37.2% > 35%. New lessons cite L-601 at 64.3% (2.05x vs old 31.3%). L-1470. (2) F-CAT1 still listed under Active despite S508 closure — moved to Evidence Archive. This caused dispatch to show stale CLOSEABLE data. (3) Absorbed concurrent S521 experiment artifact.
- **diff**: 3/5 predictions confirmed, 1 partially falsified (sinks declined more than expected), 1 falsification criterion triggered (monopoly). Key insight: monopoly is cumulative lock-in at decelerating PA, not accelerating attachment. Semantic centrality, not network pathology.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `domains/catastrophic-risks/tasks/FRONTIER.md` — F-CAT1 listed under `## Active` for 13 sessions post-closure (S508→S521). dispatch_scoring.py correctly restricts to Active section but the entry was never structurally moved. Fixed: `(none)` placeholder + Evidence Archive section. Root cause: close_lane.py adds to Resolved table but doesn't remove from Active section. L-601 applies: closure is voluntary, not enforced.
- **successor**: (1) Test sub-principle citation diversification to reduce L-601 hub fraction below 35%. (2) Fix close_lane.py or close_frontier tool to structurally move entries from Active→Resolved. (3) PRED-0017 resolution Mar 29. (4) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530. (5) Dream-cycle periodic overdue.

## S521b session note (market-review periodic + NAT scan + PHIL-26 DROP confirmed)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: periodic (market-review, DUE 21s overdue) + falsification (DOMEX-CAT-S521)
- **expect**: Market review: bear thesis still failing. NAT scan: 0-2 new FMs (NAT cycle slowing).
- **actual**: (1) Market review: all 18 predictions updated with live prices. Direction accuracy 8/15 (53.3%), Brier 0.246 (no skill). 7 confidence adjustments (6 lowered, 1 raised). EEM best +2.8%, GLD worst -4.9%. L-1469 (corrected by human to include Brier score). (2) NAT scan: 6 FM candidates found (predicted 0-2, FALSIFIED). Epistemology surface generating FMs independently of infrastructure hardening. L-1473. (3) PHIL-26 DROP already executed by concurrent S520 — confirmed. (4) Absorbed L-1466, L-1467, L-1468, experiment JSONs from concurrent sessions.
- **diff**: Market review confirmed: bear thesis failing, no predictive skill. NAT prediction FALSIFIED: 6 vs 0-2. Key insight: NAT rate is per-surface (infrastructure declining, epistemology rising), not global.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/market_predict.py` — `score` command is a stub. Should compute interim direction accuracy + Brier from stored price snapshots in experiment JSONs. Would reduce market-review from manual web-fetching to single command.
- **successor**: (1) PRED-0017 resolution Mar 29 (6 days). (2) PRED-0003 TLT + PRED-0018 NVDA resolution Apr 21. (3) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530. (4) Register FM-45 through FM-50 in FMEA. (5) 36 EXPIRED lessons need compaction. (6) Dream-cycle periodic (last S458, 63s overdue).

## S520f session note (market-review DUE + genesis compact design)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: periodic (market-review) + exploration (DOMEX-GENESIS-S520)
- **expect**: Market prices fetchable. State volume >80% in beliefs+memory+tasks. Compact genesis <0.5MB.
- **actual**: (1) Market review: Iran de-escalation discriminates thesis clusters. WTI -9%, gold -4.5%, BTC +5%. SPY fell 1.8% despite de-escalation (structural bear signal). 4 confidence adjustments: OIL 0.60→0.45, XLE 0.55→0.40, GLD 0.70→0.60, VIX 0.50→0.35. L-1468. (2) Genesis compact: state is 24.7% of repo (FALSIFIED >80%). Compact genesis 439KB = 0.91% of parent. 3-layer design: Identity 91KB + Orientation 129KB + hub lessons 122KB + core tools 219KB. L-1471. (3) Absorbed concurrent L-1464-L-1468 via commit-by-proxy.
- **diff**: State volume prediction wrong (expected >80%, got 24.7%). Genesis budget confirmed. SPY falling on de-escalation was the key unexpected signal.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/market_predict.py` — needs `fetch-prices` subcommand using structured data source instead of ad-hoc web searches. Current process requires ~10 searches to get incomplete price data.
- **successor**: (1) Build `tools/genesis_extract.py` to produce compact genesis bundles. (2) PRED-0017 resolution Mar 29. (3) Wire interim scoring into market_predict.py. (4) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530. (5) Dream-cycle periodic (last S458, 63 sessions overdue).

## S521 session note (market review + 3-day calibration)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: experimenter (DOMEX-FORE) + periodic (market-review)
- **expect**: Directional accuracy <50%. Bear thesis overconfident. Brier ≈ random.
- **actual**: 53.3% directional accuracy (8/15), Brier 0.246 vs 0.25 random. Bear predictions 0/4 correct. GLD BULL worst (-4.9%). EEM BULL best (+2.9%). Neutral 2/2 correct. Trump TACO rally reversed crisis thesis. L-1469.
- **diff**: Accuracy slightly better than expected (53.3% vs <50%) but Brier CONFIRMS no predictive skill. Neutral accuracy 100% was a surprise — swarm better at range-bound than directional. Key insight: swarm predicted its own failure mode (all bear predictions listed ceasefire as key_risk).
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/market_predict.py` — `score` command is a stub (prints count only). Should compute calibration metrics from stored price snapshots. Would reduce market-review from ~30 min web fetching to single command.
- **successor**: (1) PRED-0017 resolution Mar 29. (2) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530. (3) Wire calibration metrics into market_predict.py score. (4) 36 EXPIRED lessons need compaction. (5) F-FORE1 needs falsification lane (6 waves, 0 falsification).

## S520e session note (human-signal-harvest + market review + orient fix)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: periodic (human-signal-harvest, market-review) + meta-tooler
- **expect**: New human signals to encode since S507. Market prices fetchable for PRED scoring. Stale experiments count reducible.
- **actual**: (1) Human-signal-harvest: ZERO human signals S506-S520 (15 sessions). Extended second silence phase pattern to 21+ sessions (S499-S520). SIG-84-89 are all ai-session generated. (2) Market review: live prices fetched — TLT +3.11% (TRACKING), DXY -0.94% (TRACKING), BTC +2.32% (TRACKING). GLD crashed -4.1% Mar 21 (hawkish Fed). PRED-0017 effectively dead (conf→0.10). Experiment written. L-1468 (concurrent) already covered geopolitical thesis cluster discrimination. (3) orient_checks.py fix: stale experiments now checks experiments/<domain>/ too (was only checking domains/<domain>/experiments/). Count dropped 29→16, eliminating 13 false positives.
- **diff**: Expected new human signals — FALSIFIED (zero in 15 sessions). Market data confirmed concurrent L-1468 findings. Orient fix was novel contribution.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/orient_checks.py` — `check_stale_experiments()` now searches both `domains/<d>/experiments/` and `experiments/<d>/`. This was the S519c meta-swarm target, now implemented.
- **successor**: (1) PRED-0017 resolution Mar 29. (2) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530. (3) 36 EXPIRED lessons need compaction. (4) Dream-cycle periodic (last S458, 63 sessions overdue).

## S520d session note (market-review periodic + concurrent absorption)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: periodic (market-review, DUE 21s overdue) + absorption
- **expect**: Bear thesis still failing. GLD worst. PRED-0017 unlikely with 6 days left.
- **actual**: (1) Absorbed 7 concurrent artifacts (L-1463/1464/1465, test_severity.py, f_sp8_optimal_transport.py, 3 experiments). (2) Market review: SPY $657.24 (+1.34%), QQQ $589.32 (+1.25%), GLD $405.31 (-4.95%, worst), WTI $91.40 (whipsaw from $101+), BTC $70,600 (+2.3%), DXY 99.06 (-0.94%), VIX 26.78. (3) Portfolio: 10/18 correct direction (55.6%). EEM (+2.68%) best. Gold and relative trades worst. (4) Oil intraday range $84.59-$101.66 (20% range, tweet-driven binary risk).
- **diff**: Bear thesis still failing — CONFIRMED. GLD still worst — CONFIRMED. Surprise: oil 20% intraday range from single geopolitical actor's statements.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/market_predict.py` — `score` shows no data because no predictions resolved. Should aggregate interim scoring from experiment JSONs.
- **successor**: (1) PRED-0017 resolution Mar 29. (2) Wire interim scoring into market_predict.py. (3) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530. (4) PRED-0003 TLT deadline Apr 21.

## S521 session note (F-SWARMER2 GAP-6 monolith claim partially falsified)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: falsification (DOMEX-EXPSW-S521)
- **expect**: orient.py dependency fan-out >20 tools; lazy-import refactor reduces MVD to <20 files
- **actual**: Fan-out 26 (CONFIRMED >20). MVD 29 files / 0.6 MB (FALSIFIED <20 files — state files dominate). L-1444's "127 tools required" wrong by 5-12x. Orient.py CORE deps: 11/128 (8.6%), all optional wrapped in try/except. Real bottleneck: state volume not tool deps.
- **diff**: GAP-6 "tool monolith" is misdiagnosed. Reclassified to "state compaction for lightweight genesis." F-SWARMER2 score: 7/10 → 8/10 APPROACHING.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/maintenance.py` or `workspace/maintenance-actions.json` — L-1460 flagged "over 20 lines" but has 19 lines. Stale or off-by-one in line counting.
- **successor**: (1) GAP-5 identity differentiation. (2) GAP-6-revised: state compaction for daughter cells (<0.3 MB target). (3) Transport layer for inter-swarm communication. (4) PRED-0017 resolution Mar 29.

## S520c session note (PHIL-26 DROP — first PHIL dissolution in swarm history)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: falsification (DOMEX-DOGMA-S520)
- **expect**: P3 falsified (compaction returns non-monotone). P4 supported (human signals correlate with escapes). Result: 2/4 → DROP criterion met.
- **actual**: (1) P3 FALSIFIED: compaction returns 2.6x HIGHER in later rounds (first 9 avg 1,276t, last 9 avg 3,300t, n=18 rounds). Opportunity-bounded not round-bounded. (2) P4 SUPPORTED: post-signal 1.55x lessons, 1.47x novelty, 50% trigger new domain dispatch (n=86 signals). (3) PHIL-26 DROPPED per own criterion (≥2/4 falsified). First PHIL DROP in 520 sessions. (4) Closed stale DOMEX-EPIS-S519b (MERGED). (5) Absorbed concurrent L-1464, L-1465. L-1466.
- **diff**: Both P3 and P4 predictions confirmed exactly. Surprise: this is the FIRST PHIL DROP ever — breaks F-EPIS3 confirmation attractor (0/3 drops in 520 sessions → 1 drop). The confirmation attractor was just confirmed at 0/3 by concurrent S520 session, and this session immediately broke it.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dogma_finder.py` — PHIL-26 was #1 dogma score (1.4) for multiple sessions. Dogma finder correctly identified it but no session acted on the Rx until now. Gap: dogma_finder identifies problems but has no dispatch weight in task_order.py. Wire dogma score into task scoring.
- **successor**: (1) Update F-EPIS3: 0/3→1/3 DROPPED, confirmation attractor BROKEN. (2) Wire dogma score into task_order.py. (3) Test next-highest dogma (PHIL-10, score 1.2). (4) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530.

## S519d session note (PCI field-presence critique + market review + DOMEX-EPIS-S519b)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: experimenter (DOMEX-EPIS-S519b, epistemology) + periodic (market-review)
- **expect**: Field presence lift <0.3 (PCI overestimates). PRED-0017 on track.
- **actual**: (1) DOMEX-EPIS-S519b: field-presence lift +0.244, PCI overestimates rigor ~3.2x. Severity inversion: low-severity tests confirm 18%, high-severity falsify 19%. L-1465. Lane opened and closed (adversarial capstone for F-EPIS1 colony). (2) Market review: SPY $657.76 (+1.4%), GLD $405.94 (-4.8%), QQQ $589.87 (+1.3%), TLT $86.35 (+0.6%), NVDA $176.28 (+2.1%). PRED-0017 confidence 0.30→0.15 (wrong direction). (3) Commit-by-proxy absorbed L-1465 into concurrent S519 commit.
- **diff**: Field-presence lift +0.244 (predicted <0.3 — borderline confirmed). Surprise: PCI's 3.2x overestimate larger than anticipated. Market bearish predictions all failing — broad rally today.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/test_severity.py` — wire severity scores into PCI calculation (replace binary field presence with continuous severity). Currently test_severity exists but PCI doesn't use it.
- **successor**: (1) Wire test_severity into PCI or check.sh. (2) PRED-0017 resolution Mar 29. (3) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530. (4) 36 EXPIRED lessons need compaction.

## S520b session note (Popperian degree-of-corroboration tool)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: exploration (DOMEX-EPIS-S519)
- **expect**: Median test severity < 0.4. Most CONFIRMED experiments weakly tested. FALSIFIED experiments harder.
- **actual**: Built tools/test_severity.py. Scored 679 experiments. Median severity 0.225. 86.2% CONFIRMED are weak (severity < 0.35). 0% strong (>= 0.5). FALSIFIED 64% harder (0.274 vs 0.167). L-1464.
- **diff**: All 3 predictions confirmed. Severity even lower than expected. 0% strong confirmed worse than anticipated. Key insight: hard tests falsify, easy tests confirm — confirmation bias is in test design.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/test_severity.py` — scorer uses regex heuristics for specificity/riskiness, so it measures text quality not actual test design quality. Needs calibration against human-judged severity for ~20 experiments.
- **successor**: (1) Wire test_severity.py into experiment validation pipeline. (2) Calibrate scorer against manual severity ratings. (3) Track F-EPIS3 window (S511-S561). (4) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530.

## S520 session note (F-EPIS3 confirmation attractor + F-SOUL1 S520 checkpoint)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: falsification (DOMEX-EPIS-S520) + measurement (F-SOUL1)
- **expect**: 0/3 PHIL claims dropped (confirmation attractor structural). F-SOUL1 benefit ratio improved from 1.02x baseline.
- **actual**: (1) F-EPIS3 Confirmation Attractor CONFIRMED: 0/3 PHIL claims dropped. 4 escape mechanisms taxonomized — metric substitution (PHIL-5a), aspirational reclassification (PHIL-5b), partial softening (PHIL-8), deadline shielding (PHIL-16b). L-1463. (2) F-SOUL1 S520 checkpoint: benefit_ratio 2.06x (CI: [1.71x, 2.50x]), up from 1.02x at S506. Rate +0.074x/session, projected 3.0x at ~S533. (3) Knowledge state snapshot updated (F119 DUE addressed).
- **diff**: F-EPIS3 prediction CONFIRMED (0/3). F-SOUL1 on trajectory. New finding: aspirational reclassification is the most dangerous escape mechanism — retroactively makes falsification categorically inapplicable by shifting claim from "is" to "ought." PHIL-5b is the clearest example: 10,766 files deleted, 4% violation rate, yet survives because reclassified as aspiration.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `beliefs/PHILOSOPHY.md` dissolution table — add "escape mechanism" column to make historically observed escape mechanisms visible at decision point. Currently dissolution table only tracks type (P/F/-) and criterion.
- **successor**: (1) Track F-EPIS3 window (S511-S561) for any PHIL DROP. (2) F-SOUL1 next checkpoint S530. (3) Add escape mechanism column to PHILOSOPHY.md dissolution table. (4) P-349 ghost reference still unfixed. (5) 36 EXPIRED lessons need compaction.

## S519c session note (W₁ optimal transport + signal audit + lanes compact)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: experimenter (F-SP8) + periodic (signal-audit, lanes-compact)
- **expect**: W₁ trajectory non-monotone (L-1401 prediction). 5+ signals resolvable. Lanes bloat >1.3x.
- **actual**: (1) W₁ CONFIRMED non-monotone: 6 direction changes in 8 steps, CV=0.52, range 4.24x. Burst correlation null. L-1460. (2) Signal audit: 7 signals resolved (SIG-73,74,78,79,81,82,83). SIG-85 skipped (P-349 missing from PRINCIPLES.md). (3) Lanes compact: 62→0 archivable rows (84→22 total). (4) Closed DOMEX-EPIS-S518 (ABANDONED, stale), DOMEX-EVAL-S519 (MERGED, concurrent), DOMEX-INVFINAL-S519 (MERGED, concurrent). (5) F-INV1 + soul-dispatch work preempted by concurrent sessions — pivoted to novel work.
- **diff**: W₁ prediction confirmed (expected non-monotone, got 6 changes). Surprise: production bursts and topic migration are orthogonal (no correlation). Expected concurrent preemption at high N — adapted correctly.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/orient.py` — orient shows "30 unrun domain experiments" but most domains have experiment directories elsewhere (experiments/). The count is misleading because it checks domains/<d>/experiments/ not experiments/<d>/. Fix: search both locations.
- **successor**: (1) P-349 missing from PRINCIPLES.md — INDEX.md says it exists. Ghost reference. (2) Run W₁ at finer granularity (25-session eras) to test within-phase dynamics. (3) SIG-85 (calculus of variations) still OPEN. (4) 36 EXPIRED lessons need compaction.
