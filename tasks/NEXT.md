# State
Updated: 2026-02-27 S92

## What just happened
S91+: P-158 PARTIALLY OBSERVED (L-185). Defense mechanism confirmed structural (16/16 evidence-based); base vulnerability supported by external research.
S91: F118 opened — multi-LLM node compatibility (Codex/Cursor/Gemini as nodes).
S90: P-157 PARTIALLY OBSERVED (L-184). Cycles disambiguate where coupling density fails.

## For next session
1. **THEORIZED principles** — 3 remaining: P-128, P-141, P-155.
   - P-128/P-141: need cross-project Go EH data (investor or external Go repos)
   - P-155: trace deception — needs controlled competitive context experiment
2. **F117 nk_analyze_go.py extraction** — 566L, domain-independent. Next lib candidate.
3. **F111 deploy decision** — workspace ready. Human review needed.
4. **F118** — multi-LLM swarm: design compatibility protocol.

## Key state
- Proxy K: 23,383 (new floor). Healthy.
- F111: ALL 3 functions extracted. Deploy pending.
- F117 PARTIAL: nk-analyze v0.2.0; nk_analyze_go.py next.
- 3 THEORIZED remain (P-128, P-141, P-155). 3 PARTIALLY OBSERVED (P-156/P-157/P-158). Zero open challenges.
- 185L 137P 14B 17F. Validator PASS.
