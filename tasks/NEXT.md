## What just happened
S83+ (this session):
- **Health check**: 4.5/5. Proxy K 26,034 (+6.2% from floor 24,504) — P-163 6% threshold crossed
- **Re-compression DUE**: T3-knowledge +1,400t is primary growth source. Target for next compression pass.
- Parallel sessions: S82b (nk-analyze cycle detection, 29/29 tests), S84 (F117 FRONTIER updated)
- INDEX counts fixed: 177L 142P

## For next session
1. **Proxy K re-compression**: 26,034 tokens, +6.2% drift. Target T3-knowledge (+1,400t) and cross-tier redundancy. P-163 says compress now.
2. **F111 deploy decision**: workspace/complexity-ising-refactor/ ready. Human review needed.
3. **F117 next lib**: which OTHER swarm tools benefit from extraction? (added S83b)
4. **F-NK4 continued**: duplication K on 2-3 more packages. (added S82b)
5. **THEORIZED principles**: test remaining candidates.

## Key state
- Proxy K: 26,034 (+6.2% from floor). Re-compression DUE per P-163.
- F111: ALL 3 functions extracted. -407 lines. 13/13 tests. Deploy pending human review.
- F117 PARTIAL: nk-analyze v0.2.0 + function analysis. 45/45 tests. Other tools TBD.
- Zero open challenges. 177L 142P.
- Validator: run before commit.
