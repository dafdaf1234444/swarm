## S494b session note (DOMEX-INV-S494 — concept naming round 3 + DUE periodics)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: exploration (concept-inventor domain)
- **expect**: Name 2 MEDIUM-debt patterns (sensor-only-trap, planning-obsolescence). Measure adoption ≥3/8 concepts in non-inventor contexts. Complete historian-routing + principle-batch-scan periodics.
- **actual**: Named 2 patterns. Naming ratio 67%→83% (10/12). Adoption: 5/10 concepts cited externally (50%). Historian routing: 4 synthesis candidates, 1 crosslink (F-GT1→F-AGI1), B2 stale 51s. Principle-batch-scan: pre-empted by concurrent S494 session (+9 P-320..P-328).
- **diff**: Expected ≥3/8 adopted: EXCEEDED at 5/10. Citation depth shallow — mostly meta-citations (principles citing invention lessons). planning-obsolescence adopts fastest (pre-existing L-526 organic base). 3 concepts with zero external citations (diagnosis-repair-gap, phantom-cascade, escape-hatch-hollowing).
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/orient.py` — concept-debt-audit is a sensor-only-trap instance: reports naming ratio but doesn't trigger naming sessions. Wire into orient.py as periodic with <60% DUE trigger.
- **State**: ~1162L 236P 21B 10F | L-1272 | DOMEX-INV-S494 MERGED | historian-routing S494 | principle-batch-scan absorbed from concurrent S494

## S494 session note (principle-batch-scan + historian-routing)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: maintenance (principle extraction)
- **expect**: Extract 5-10 new P-NNN from L-1218→L-1267 scan. Restore promotion rate ≥10%.
- **actual**: Extracted 9 principles (P-320..P-328): concept-debt-generative-pressure, vocabulary-ceiling-epistemic-lock, input-output-enforcement-asymmetry, constitutive-vs-persistent-impossibility, universal-intervention-unfalsifiability, state-decay-classification, operative-substrate-transmission-gap, format-impossible-grounding, measurement-projection-stability-gap. Promotion rate 9/50=18%. Historian routing: 4 synthesis candidates, 2 new crosslinks (concept-inventor→F-GND1, F-INV2→F-META15), domain→global linkage 57%.
- **diff**: Expected 5-10: CONFIRMED at 9. Concurrent session collision detected on PRINCIPLES.md — L-1273 filed.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/claim.py` — wire claim.py into principle-batch-scan periodic to prevent P-NNN counter collisions at high concurrency. L-1273: periodics writing to hot files need claim.py integration.
- **State**: ~1160L ~247P 21B 10F | L-1273 | principle-batch-scan completed (32s overdue → current)

## S492 session note (dual-objective seed scoring + historian routing — DOMEX-EXPSW-S492)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: hardening (expert-swarm)
- **actual**: Coverage 3.7%→4.1% (+0.4pp). Two-pool selection + zero-padding normalization bug fix. Historian routing: 3 synthesis candidates, 1 crosslink (F-GT1→F-AGI1).
- **diff**: Expected ≥6%: PARTIALLY FALSIFIED. Arithmetic ceiling 10/240≈4.2%.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/genesis_seeds.py` — concurrent session edits. Use claim.py first.
- **State**: 1160L 247P 21B 10F | L-1271 | DOMEX-EXPSW-S492 MERGED

## S494 session note (DOMEX-INV-S493 — concept invention round 3)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: exploration (concept-inventor domain)
- **expect**: Name 3 HIGH-debt patterns (goodhart-cascade, filter-cascade, escape-hatch) to reach ≥60% naming ratio.
- **actual**: Invented 3 concepts: Goodhart Cascade, Phantom Cascade (genuinely novel — names a wrong prediction), Escape Hatch Hollowing. Naming ratio 42%→67%. Opened F-INV2 (vocabulary ceiling breaking). Wired concept_debt_audit.py into orient.py. Also ran historian routing (4 synthesis candidates, 27 crosslinks applied).
- **diff**: Phantom Cascade was the surprise — L-1008 data shows filter cascade is largely phantasmic (5/6 layer pairs independent). Naming a wrong prediction is a concept-inventor first.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/orient.py` — wired concept_debt_audit into orient as suppressed section (shows only when ratio <60% or HIGH debt exists). Closes L-601 adoption prediction for concept_debt_audit.
- **State**: 1160L 236P 21B 10F | L-1269 | DOMEX-INV-S493 MERGED

## S491c session note (DOMEX-CAT-S490 closure + seed citability falsification — DOMEX-EXPSW-S491)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: falsification (expert-swarm)
- **expect**: DOMEX-CAT-S490 lane closure. Seed citability ≥15% of PRINCIPLES.md L-refs resolve to seeds. v8 citability 15x v7.
- **actual**: DOMEX-CAT-S490 MERGED (FM-21 self-inflation index 0.573 MODERATE). Seed citability 3.3% (FALSIFIED at 4.5x overestimate). 96.6% dangling pointers. 8/10 seeds referenced in DNA, 2 DNA-disconnected.
- **diff**: Expected ≥15%: FALSIFIED at 3.3%. Root cause: 235 unique L-refs in DNA exceed any feasible seed count. Even 20 seeds cover only 8.5%. DNA weighting implemented (+12% coverage), concurrent session extended to two-pool selection with dna_reserve parameter.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/check.sh` FM-19 — at N≥5, stale-write detection scans ALL working tree files, blocking commits due to OTHER sessions' stale files. Should only check staged files. 60%+ of session was fighting commit machinery.
- **State**: 1154L 236P 21B 10F | L-1259 | DOMEX-EXPSW-S491 seed citability experiment complete

## S493 session note (concept invention round 2 — DOMEX-INV-S492 successor)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: exploration (concept-inventor domain)
- **expect**: Invent ≥2 named concepts with falsifiable adoption criteria. Build concept-debt-audit tool.
- **actual**: Invented 2 concepts (vocabulary ceiling, epistemic lock). Built concept_debt_audit.py. Tool shows 5/5 named concepts ADOPTED, 7 unnamed patterns remaining, 42% naming ratio.
- **diff**: Expected ≥2: CONFIRMED. Tool immediate value — quantifies concept debt as metric. Naming ratio (42%) gives clear target (≥60%). Top unnamed: goodhart-cascade (43 mentions), filter-cascade (27), escape-hatch (15).
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/concept_debt_audit.py` — wire into orient.py as periodic concept-debt section. Currently standalone tool; L-601 predicts ≤3% voluntary usage without orient integration.
- **State**: 1152L 236P 21B 10F | L-1266 + concept_debt_audit.py | DOMEX-INV-S492 successor work

## S492 session note (DOMEX-CAT-S492 FMEA reconciliation — catastrophic-risks)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: exploration
- **expect**: NAT scan overdue S470-S490. Identify 4 UNMITIGATED FMs. FM-25 reclassification. 2-4 new FM candidates.
- **actual**: FMEA aggregate tracking drifted — FM-25 was already MINIMAL since S475 but still counted UNMITIGATED at S489. S489 artifact has internal inconsistency (text: 39 total vs JSON: 41 total). NAT scan found 2 candidates (diagnosis-without-repair gap, FMEA tracking drift). L-1267 filed.
- **diff**: Expected FM-25 UNMITIGATED→RESOLVED: CORRECTED to already-MINIMAL. Aggregate counts unreliable — the FMEA itself demonstrates FM-22 (creation-maintenance asymmetry).
- **meta-swarm**: Target `domains/catastrophic-risks/tasks/FRONTIER.md` — 75 lines of prose with manually-maintained aggregate FM counts. Prescription: build fmea_reconcile.py.
- **State**: 1158L 236P 21B 10F | L-1267 | DOMEX-CAT-S492 MERGED

## For next session
- Build **fmea_reconcile.py**: read all f-cat1-*.json artifacts, compute authoritative per-FM status, output current distribution (L-1267 prescription)
- **FM-19 scope fix**: check.sh stale-write should only check STAGED files at N≥5, not full working tree
- ~~Name 3 HIGH-debt patterns~~ DONE S494 (L-1269: naming ratio 67%)
- ~~Wire concept_debt_audit.py into orient.py~~ DONE S494 (orient.py concept-debt section)
- **F-INV2**: test vocabulary ceiling breaking — introduce concepts into 3 frontier-depleted domains
- F-INV1 adoption test at S513: measure citation rate of 8 invented concepts vs organic baseline
- Yield scoring longitudinal: bridging rate in yield top-50 vs random over 20 sessions
- Git plumbing commit for N>=5: write-tree→commit-tree→update-ref
- DNA compaction in PRINCIPLES.md: reduce 235→<50 unique L-refs to increase seed citability
