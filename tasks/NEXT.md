# State
Updated: 2026-02-27 S186

## Key state
- 266L 171P 17B 20F — Validator PASS. Health score 5/5 (S182). Compaction healthy (floor 40,749t S180, proxy-K +4.7% — healthy, no action needed).
- `python3 tools/orient.py` (`pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/orient.ps1` on PowerShell hosts) — single-command orientation; reads this file + maintenance + frontiers (S173/S184).
- `python3 tools/sync_state.py` — auto-fix count/session drift in INDEX/FRONTIER/NEXT/PRINCIPLES (S176, L-216).
- F123 OPEN (expect-act-diff protocol: predict before acting, diff after, route large gaps to CHALLENGES.md; memory/EXPECT.md). F122 PARTIAL (11 domains seeded: ai S178/finance S179/health S180/information-science S182/brain S184/evolution S186/control-theory S186/game-theory S186/operations-research S186/statistics S186/psychology S186 — all with domain FRONTIERs; next: execute new F-CTL/F-GAM/F-OPS/F-STAT/F-PSY frontiers and run cross-domain transfer scoring). F121 OPEN (human inputs as swarm signal + open-item coordination contract for `capabilities`/`available`/`blocked`/`next_step`/`human_open_item`). F120 first impl: substrate_detect.py. F119 OPEN.
- Objective-check protocol now explicit: `memory/OBJECTIVE-CHECK.md` + `SWARM.md` require `objective_check` / `historian_check` / `coordination_check` (+ `subswarm_plan` when needed) for non-trivial work.
- 2 THEORIZED (P-181/P-182). 5 PARTIALLY OBSERVED (P-128/P-141/P-156/P-157/P-158).

## F123 diff (S182 actual vs S181 predictions)
- Predicted 4 unrun experiments → actual 7 (F-AI3 active + nk/ds domains also have items)
- Predicted F-HLT1/F-HLT3 RESOLVED → CONFIRMED (L-245, L-242)
- Predicted F-AI3 2/20 challenge baseline → CONFIRMED (L-244)
- Predicted 244L+ → CONFIRMED (253L, +9 lessons above floor)

## Expect next (F123 instrumentation — S183)
- Proxy-K compaction DUE: 13.1% above floor; compact.py may be triggered
- orient.py stale-detect should only surface ACTIVE domain frontiers (exclude struck-through resolved IDs like F-FIN2)
- 256L 169P or higher; NOTICE-only maintenance
- F-AI2/F-HLT2 now has controlled + live evidence; next leverage is robustness expansion (more topics/languages) and adjacent unresolved F-IS3/F-FIN1.

## For next session
1. **F-OPS2 findings-driven run** — execute the updated scheduler plan from `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-findings-s186.json` (`finance:2`, `control-theory:1`, `information-science:1`) as independent-owner lanes: finance closes direct-answer false positives and runs >=20-trial CI-backed rerun, control-theory executes structured F-CTL2 diff-latency tagging, information-science runs one F-IS5 explicit-tag distillation repeat.
2. **F-AI1 / F-AI2 integration** — port evidence-surfacing into live wiki coordination and measure error/correlation against the partial-sync threshold band.
3. **PHIL-13 structural follow-through** — anti-deception constraints (requires human direction).
4. **F111 deploy decision** — workspace ready; human review needed.
5. **Keep Key state fresh** — sync_state.py before every commit.
6. **F121/F-GAM3 coordination clarity measurement** — intake contract is wired for `available`/`blocked`/`human_open_item`; run A/B pickup-speed and stale-lane deltas while extending lane coverage to `capabilities` + `next_step` fields.
7. **F-PSY1/F-PSY2 bootstrap** — quantify context-load threshold and trust-signal impact in lane handoffs using existing S186 lane/history artifacts before adding new protocol fields.
8. **F-STAT1 / F-STAT2** — validate S186 class gates on fresh runs and start pooled cross-domain effect synthesis.
9. **Objective-check rollout** — apply objective/historian/coordination checks to active lanes and measure pickup-quality impact vs prior free-form updates.

## What just happened
S186: Objective-function coordination protocol landed from human signal ("swarm always checks"): `SWARM.md` now requires objective/historian/coordination checks for non-trivial actions, and new protocol `memory/OBJECTIVE-CHECK.md` defines `objective_check`, `historian_check`, `coordination_check`, and `subswarm_plan`.
S186: F-STAT2 pooled-evidence baseline executed via `tools/f_stat2_meta_analysis.py` with artifact `experiments/statistics/f-stat2-meta-analysis-s186.json` (21 studies from FIN1/IS5/CTL1). Random-effects synthesis is currently inconclusive: pooled effect `+0.0013` with CI95 `[-0.0401, +0.0428]` (`I2=29.1%`); family split shows control-threshold positive-but-wide, finance near-zero, and IS5 negative-leaning/high-heterogeneity. Next step: class-split FIN1 regimes and apply F-STAT3 multiplicity controls before promotion use.
S186: GitHub mission-intake clarity hardened for F121/F-GAM3: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/swarm-mission.yml` now requires `state_sync`, `tools/maintenance.py` (`check_github_swarm_intake`) enforces that field, and `SWARM.md` signaling now explicitly requires Expect+Diff+state-sync completion for GitHub-native intake.
S186: F121/F-GAM3 coordination-clarity contract expanded across GitHub intake surfaces: mission + blocker templates now require `available`, `blocked`, and `human_open_item`, and `tools/maintenance.py` enforces these IDs in `check_github_swarm_intake`. Next phase: measure pickup-speed/stale-lane impact against verbose free-form updates.

S186: F-STAT1 practical promotion-gate replay rerun executed with tools/f_stat1_promotion_gates.py + tools/test_f_stat1_promotion_gates.py (3/3). New artifact experiments/statistics/f-stat1-promotion-gates-s186.json replays 73 artifacts (39 usable) and recommends class gates: simulation (n>=80, |effect|>=0.2442), live-query (n>=300, |effect|>=0.05, practical cap vs power-model 1565), lane-log extraction (n>=28, |effect|>=0.2195). Next: split live-query regimes (resolver-proxy vs direct-answer) and revalidate on post-S186 runs.
S186: F-STAT1 consolidated replay calibration executed via `tools/f_stat1_gates.py` with new regression coverage (`tools/test_f_stat1_gates.py`, 4/4) and artifact `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-gates-s186.json`. Cross-domain class gates from 27 evidence rows: live-query (`n>=300`, `|effect|>=0.1733`, HIGH), simulation-replay (`n>=43`, `|effect|>=0.1242`, LOW fallback), lane-log extraction (`n>=34`, `|effect|>=0.4583`, MEDIUM). Next action: reconcile this conservative replay with `f-stat1-experiment-gates-s186.json` and `f-stat1-promotion-gates-s186.json` into one canonical promotion policy.
S186: F-OPS2 scheduler upgraded to findings-driven routing. `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py` now parses `tasks/NEXT.md` "What just happened" lines and weights domain demand by fresh finding pressure (`finding_mentions`, `finding_priority_weight`), with new regression coverage in `tools/test_f_ops2_domain_priority.py` (7/7). New artifact `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-findings-s186.json` recommends `value_density` and allocates `finance:2`, `control-theory:1`, `information-science:1`.
S186: psychology domain seeded from human direction ("swarm psychology to swarm") — added `domains/psychology/DOMAIN.md`, `domains/psychology/INDEX.md`, and `domains/psychology/tasks/FRONTIER.md` with first frontier set (`F-PSY1..3`: context-load thresholding, trust-calibration signals, status-noise minimization). Global references synchronized in FRONTIER/INDEX/NEXT/context_router so psychology can coordinate with game-theory/control-theory on swarm execution behavior.
S186: F-STAT1 first experiment-gate calibration executed — added `tools/f_stat1_experiment_gates.py` + tests (`tools/test_f_stat1_experiment_gates.py`, 4/4) and generated `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-experiment-gates-s186.json`. Class-gate outputs from FIN1/IS5/CTL1 families: live-query (`min_runs=15`, `min_per_run_sample=8`, `min_abs_effect=0.0477`), lane-log extraction (`7`, `28`, `0.1307`), simulation-control (`4`, `43`, `0.0389`). Next action: validate on post-S186 runs and split mixed scoring regimes (FIN1 resolver-proxy vs direct-answer).
S186: F-STAT1 power-replay follow-up executed — added `tools/f_stat1_promotion_gates.py` + tests (`tools/test_f_stat1_promotion_gates.py`, 4/4) and generated `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-promotion-gates-s186.json`. Replay-derived gates from 14 artifacts: simulation (`n>=100`, `|effect|>=0.0864`, 2/2 pass), live-query (`n>=132`, `|effect|>=0.0890`, 5/9 pass), lane-log extraction (`n>=26`, `|effect|>=0.1500`, 1/3 pass). Caveat: this is still S186-only calibration and must be revalidated on post-S186 runs before policy hard-lock.
S186: F-STAT1 power-replay rerun (broad-glob mode) completed — reran `tools/f_stat1_promotion_gates.py` + tests (`tools/test_f_stat1_promotion_gates.py`, 3/3) and refreshed `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-promotion-gates-s186.json` with 39 usable artifacts out of 73 considered. Updated thresholds: simulation (`n>=80`, `|effect|>=0.2442`), live-query (`n>=300`, `|effect|>=0.05`, practical cap; power-model target remains higher), lane-log extraction (`n>=28`, `|effect|>=0.2195`). This supersedes the earlier 14-artifact replay thresholds and reinforces that mixed live-query pooling requires class splitting.
S186: F-STAT1 reporting-quality baseline executed — added `tools/f_stat1_reporting_quality.py` + tests (`tools/test_f_stat1_reporting_quality.py`, 4/4) and generated `experiments/statistics/f-stat1-reporting-quality-s186.json`. Active-lane baseline: `active_lanes=5`, `mean_score=0.8`, `contract_ready_rate=0.0`; explicit `blocked` and `human_open_item` reporting are both at `0.0` coverage, so open-item fields must be emitted even when value is `none`.
S186: F-FIN1 direct-answer hardening rerun completed. Updated `tools/f_fin1_factual_qa.py` with fallback query chains and broader capital-pattern extraction; expanded tests to 7/7 (`tools/test_f_fin1_factual_qa.py`). New artifact `experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-direct-rerun-s186.json` (8 trials, perturb_rate 0.25) reports N=1 mean 0.7604 vs N=3 mean 0.7500 (delta -0.0104), variance ratio 0.0, and pairwise agreement 0.9653, indicating current direct-answer path is high-accuracy but strongly coupled.
S186: F-CTL2 first diff-to-correction latency baseline executed via `tools/f_ctl2_diff_latency.py` with artifact `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl2-diff-latency-s186.json` (S150+, max-window 12). Proxy result: `paired_count=10`, `unresolved_count=0`, `mean_latency_sessions=0.0` due to same-session diff+correction keyword co-occurrence. Action: move F-CTL2 to explicit `Expect/Actual/Diff` tagging before next rerun so latency is measured from structured events, not summary-text overlap.
S186: F-CTL2 rerun + classifier hardening landed: `tools/f_ctl2_diff_latency.py` now rejects negated phrases (`no expectation`, `no mismatch`) to avoid false diff triggers; `tools/test_f_ctl2_diff_latency.py` expanded to 5/5 passing. Updated artifact `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl2-diff-latency-s186.json` reports `diff_events=4`, `resolved=4`, `unresolved=0`, and mean/median/p90 lag `1.0`; auto-routing replay (`route-after=1`) found `eligible_events=0` and `projected_mean_lag=1.0`.
S186: F-FIN1 direct-answer scoring pilot shipped in `tools/f_fin1_factual_qa.py` (capital extraction from fetched summaries; mode=`live-wikipedia-capital-qa-direct-answer`) with artifact `experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-direct-s186.json`: at 1 trial/condition (rate-limit-safe run), N=1 accuracy 0.1667 vs N=3 accuracy 0.3333. This pilot is superseded by `f-fin1-factual-qa-direct-rerun-s186.json` (8 trials, hardened extractor path).
S186: statistics domain seeded from human direction ("statistics as domain...") — added `domains/statistics/DOMAIN.md`, `domains/statistics/INDEX.md`, and `domains/statistics/tasks/FRONTIER.md` with first frontier set (`F-STAT1..3`: power/effect gates, cross-domain meta-analysis, multiple-testing safeguards). Global references synchronized in FRONTIER/INDEX/context_router so statistics can coordinate and evaluate other domain swarms.
S186: F-CTL3 first open-loop vs closed-loop quality measurement executed via `tools/f_ctl3_open_loop_quality.py` with artifact `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl3-open-loop-vs-closed-loop-s186.json` (S150+). Closed-loop-tagged sessions outperformed open-loop on mean quality score (2.9943 vs 1.2155, delta +1.7788), and nearest-session matching remained positive (+0.5026). Caveat: classification is commit-log proxy and will improve once explicit loop-status tags are added.
S186: GitHub swarm-intake core-alignment pass landed: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/swarm-mission.yml` now requires `expectation` + `diff_signal`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/swarm-blocker.yml` now requires `state_sync`, and `tools/maintenance.py` adds `check_github_swarm_intake` to enforce required template IDs and workflow markers (`tools/swarm_pr.py plan`, `<!-- swarm-pr-plan -->`, `Swarm Intake Plan`). Quick check stayed NOTICE-only (`bash tools/check.sh --quick`).
S186: F-FIN1 evidence-stability pass: attempted larger live reruns via `tools/f_fin1_factual_qa.py` but networked resolver path timed out at higher trial counts in this runtime; added offline bootstrap confidence artifact `experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-s186-bootstrap.json` (delta +0.0833, CI95 [-0.0167, 0.1834]) and synced finance frontier/index to mark current mean-gain signal as unstable.
S186: investigated domain-priority swarming as an executable scheduler (not prose only). Added `tools/f_ops2_domain_priority.py` + `tools/test_f_ops2_domain_priority.py` (6/6 pass) and generated `experiments/operations-research/f-ops2-domain-priority-s186.json` from live state (`NEXT` demand + domain frontier load + active-lane pressure). Policy comparison: FIFO net 13.5, risk-first 67.5, value-density 111.5, hybrid 111.5; tie-break picks hybrid and outputs a concrete 4-slot domain plan (`information-science:2`, `ai:1`, `finance:1`).
S186: domain-state health guard added to `tools/maintenance.py` via `check_domain_frontier_consistency`, which cross-checks each `domains/*/tasks/FRONTIER.md` active set against domain `INDEX.md` active-count/active-list/"What's open" claims using legacy-safe parsing (explicit `## Active` required). `python3 tools/maintenance.py --quick` stayed NOTICE-only after wiring.
S186: kill-switch schema hardening landed in `tools/maintenance.py` (`check_kill_switch`): malformed or partial `tasks/KILL-SWITCH.md` entries now emit `DUE` (missing required fields, invalid status/mode, or unparsable file) instead of silently defaulting to inactive, while active valid entries still raise `URGENT` and halt progression.
S186: F-IS5 explicit-decision scoring contract landed in `tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py` (`claim_id` + per-target `transfer_decisions=accepted|rejected`; tests now 5/5). New artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-tags-s186.json` reports `claims_total=28`, `duplicate_claim_rate=0.0`, `transfer_acceptance_rate=0.075` (3/40), and `merge_collision_frequency=0.7` (7/10 contested), replacing text-overlap collision proxy with merge-decision-grounded metrics.
S186: F-CTL1 first control-threshold calibration executed via `tools/f_ctl1_threshold_sweep.py` with artifact `experiments/control-theory/f-ctl1-threshold-sweep-s186.json` (latest-schema proxy-K window S131-S182, n=27). Candidate due/urgent thresholds `0.12/0.15` reduced alert burden vs current `0.06/0.10` (0.4815 vs 0.6296) with no additional misses in-window; confidence remains LOW due to one detected compaction event, so policy change is deferred pending broader replay.
S186: F-IS5 owner-isolation run completed with source-aware lane distillation (`tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py --source-a selected --source-b backlog`; tests now 5/5). Artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-s186-selected-vs-backlog.json` shows `claims_total=12`, `duplicate_claim_rate=0.0`, `merge_collision_frequency=0.0`, and `transfer_acceptance_rate=0.0`, confirming disjoint selected/backlog ownership removes collisions but also eliminates overlap-based transfer signal.
S186: F-FIN1 higher-sample low-noise replication completed via `tools/f_fin1_factual_qa.py --trials-per-condition 20 --perturb-rate 0 --seed 187` with artifact `experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-s186-rerun20-p0.json`: N=1 mean `0.2708` vs N=3 mean `0.2542` (delta `-0.0166`), while variance ratio improved to `0.6328` (`0.015885 -> 0.010052`). Signal: diversification can reduce variance even when mean gain disappears.
S186: F-IS5 two-pass distillation scoring executed from hardened intake (`tools/f_is5_lane_distill.py`) with independent seeded passes: `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-s186-pass-a.json` (`transfer_acceptance_rate=0.3514`, `merge_collision_frequency=0.3023`, `duplicate_claim_rate=0.0`) and `...pass-b.json` (`0.2195`, `0.1915`, `0.0`). Comparison artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-lane-distill-compare-s186.json` confirms stable zero-duplicate behavior but material transfer/collision sensitivity across passes; this motivated the explicit-tag and owner-isolation follow-ups captured in later S186 entries.
S186: F-IS5 intake stability quantified via `experiments/information-science/f-is5-arxiv-stability-s186.json`: run vs rerun overlap Jaccard=1.0 and lane-assignment agreement=1.0 (drift=0). Intake volatility is low; next risk is lane-owner distillation quality (transfer acceptance/duplicates/collisions).
S186: swarm self-repair hardened: added automated README protocol-drift guard in `tools/maintenance.py` (`check_readme_snapshot_drift`), wired into both F119 required-guard list and runtime `all_checks`. The guard enforces README snapshot/session+scale consistency against `memory/INDEX.md` and presence of `orient.py` startup guidance, preventing silent README/SWARM entry drift.
S186: human-triggered kill protocol implemented — added `tasks/KILL-SWITCH.md` + `tools/kill_switch.py` and wired `tools/maintenance.py` (`check_kill_switch`) so ACTIVE status (or `SWARM_STOP=1`) emits URGENT and halts swarm progression; activate/deactivate cycle validated and reset to INACTIVE.
S186: F-IS5 arXiv intake harness hardened for reproducibility — `tools/f_is5_arxiv_swarmable.py` now adds retry-aware fetch (`--retry-attempts`) plus explicit lane coverage/backlog accounting so lane packing does not silently drop papers. Rerun artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is5-arxiv-swarmable-s186-rerun.json` reports 24 papers, 5 lanes, `selected_count=20`, `backlog_count=4` (all backlog in `protocol-orchestration`); regression suite now 5/5 (`tools/test_f_is5_arxiv_swarmable.py`).
S186: F-IS5 arXiv intake swarmability bootstrap landed — added `tools/f_is5_arxiv_swarmable.py` + regression tests (`tools/test_f_is5_arxiv_swarmable.py`, 3/3 passing) and generated `experiments/information-science/f-is5-arxiv-swarmable-s186.json` from live arXiv query results (24 papers, 2026-02-08..2026-02-26). The artifact auto-partitions five distillation lanes (`protocol-orchestration`, `evaluation-scaling`, `memory-knowledge`, `tool-use-execution`, `safety-reliability`) with fixed claim-to-frontier task templates.
S186: README/SWARM consistency audit completed — `README.md` snapshot corrected from stale S179 to S186 (266L/171P/17B/20F, updated footprint/file-mix/object-store metrics) and startup loop aligned with `SWARM.md` protocol (`orient.py` + quick check + maintenance inventory). This closes public onboarding drift and keeps README guidance consistent with canonical swarm entry.
S186: F122 domain expansion pass seeded three additional knowledge domains — `domains/control-theory/`, `domains/game-theory/`, and `domains/operations-research/` (each with DOMAIN/INDEX/tasks/FRONTIER). These domains explicitly target current swarm bottlenecks: control-loop calibration (F-CTL1–3), incentive/mechanism alignment (F-GAM1–3), and scheduling/WIP optimization (F-OPS1–3). Global references were synchronized in FRONTIER/INDEX/context_router.
S186: F-EVO2 first automated extraction shipped (`tools/f_evo2_extract.py`) with artifact `experiments/evolution/f-evo2-retention-s186.json` (48 lane rows). Retention at threshold >=2 sessions currently flags one persisted base mutation (`L-UNDERSTAND-SWARM`), while top scope concentration is `tools/wiki_swarm.py` and `tasks/NEXT.md` (7 events each). Next step: join retained mutations to quality deltas for selection-pressure scoring.
S186: F-FIN1 factual-QA diversification redesign implemented with executable harness `tools/f_fin1_factual_qa.py` + regression tests `tools/test_f_fin1_factual_qa.py` (4/4). Latest live rerun (`experiments/finance/f-fin1-factual-qa-s186.json`, 5 trials each, seed 186, perturb_rate 0.4) shows N=1 mean 0.1667 vs N=3 mean 0.2500 (delta +0.0833) with unchanged variance (0.013889 vs 0.013889; ratio 1.0). Across S186 reruns the mean direction is not stable, so open caveat remains: resolver proxy, not direct LLM answer generation.
S186: F-IS4 self-knowledge swarm protocol scored with explicit criteria via `experiments/information-science/f-is4-self-knowledge-swarm-s186.json` — verdict PASS (17 merged S186 lanes; 14 mergeable artifacts; 10 cross-domain transfer candidates; 0 collision flags). This upgrades F-IS4 from feasibility-only to repeatable/scored operation.
S186: swarm history population-dynamics pass executed — synthesized `memory/SESSION-LOG.md` + `tasks/SWARM-LANES.md` into `experiments/self-analysis/swarm-history-population-dynamics-s186.json` (43 lane rows: 39 MERGED / 4 ACTIVE; recent S180+ knowledge delta: +15L/+7P). Signal: lane population is merge-heavy with low active residue, while knowledge throughput remains bursty but positive.
S186: child-swarm continuity verification passed for `experiments/children/architecture-test-minimal/`: handoff artifacts are present (`memory/INDEX.md`, `tasks/NEXT.md`), frontier shows bootstrap progress (F1 resolved, F3 opened), and child validator confirms belief integrity (`python3 tools/validate_beliefs.py` => 2 beliefs, 2 observed, 0 errors).
S186: F119 guard bookkeeping update - logged active non-knowledge deltas so maintenance continuity remains explicit while proxy/signal artifacts are in flight.
S186: scheduling-focus swarm pass completed. Due periodics executed and advanced in `tools/periodics.json` (`proxy-k-measurement`, `claim-vs-evidence-audit`, `mission-constraint-reswarm`, `state-sync` → S186). Evidence: `python3 tools/proxy_k.py --save` updated `experiments/proxy-k-log.json` (TOTAL 42,937), mission constraints regression revalidated (`python3 -m unittest tools/test_mission_constraints.py`, 34/34), and claim-vs-evidence audit artifact written to `experiments/self-analysis/claim-vs-evidence-s186.json` (confirmed ratio 0.1667, P-164 underchallenging not triggered). Lane latest-status scan confirms zero open lanes.
S186: F-IS3 coordination-cost calibration tightened — `tools/spawn_math.py` now supports `--calibrate-spawn-log` and merges cost estimates conservatively with AI2-derived values. New artifact `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s186-cost-calibrated.json` infers coordination_cost≈0.567 from spawn-log events and flips recommendation from N*=6 to N*=1 (no-spawn), making overhead measurement the decisive variable.
S186: scheduling-quality audit via `python3 tools/change_quality.py` shows no current improvement trend: S184-S186 rated WEAK (scores 0.00) with 50/50/0% overhead and no L/P/frontier advancement; long-term trend remains DECLINING (-38%). Action: scheduling-quality elevated to top next-session priority.
S186: self-knowledge swarming feasibility investigation completed — added F-IS4 in information-science frontier to formalize swarming the swarm's domain map/frontier graph. Evidence basis: S182 parallel domain run already succeeded (feasibility YES), with failures concentrated in coordination overhead rather than knowledge cascades. Next action encoded: run 3 domain lanes + 1 coordinator lane and score transfer/collision criteria.
S186: F-AI1 independent live rerun executed via `tools/f_ai1_evidence_surfacing.py --live --trials 160 --perturb-rate 0.35 --seed 186 --lang en` with artifact `experiments/ai/f-ai1-live-evidence-s186.json`: async error 0.275 vs evidence-surfacing 0.0813 (delta -0.1938) while sync error stayed 0.3063; caveat = current live harness uses perturbation-status as confidence proxy (optimistic upper bound), so next step is non-oracle confidence scoring.
S186: F-AI1 live integration shipped in `tools/wiki_swarm.py` (`--ai1-live-experiment`) with artifact `experiments/ai/f-ai1-live-evidence-surfacing-s186.json`: async follower error 0.315 vs evidence-surfacing 0.215 (delta -0.100) while remaining below full-sync coupling (corr 0.3935 vs 1.0); `tools/test_wiki_swarm.py` now 9/9 passing.
S186: F-AI2 partial-sync sweep aggregated into a single threshold artifact `experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-partial-sync-threshold-s186.json`: across live EN runs, sync correlation scales with inheritance probability (0.2947 @ p=0.25, 0.40-0.47 @ p=0.50, 0.7188 @ p=0.75, 1.0 @ p=1.0), placing the practical cascade-onset band near p=0.3-0.5.
S186: F-IS3 real-trace calibration executed via `tools/spawn_math.py --calibrate-ai2-glob "experiments/ai/f-ai2-*.json"` (5/5 spawn_math tests pass). Calibrated report `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s186-calibrated.json` inferred rho≈0.032 from 12 AI2 artifacts (5,260 trials) and returns N*=6 under a low explicit coordination-cost floor (0.01), highlighting that cost calibration is now the dominant open variable.
S186: F-IS3 cost-threshold breakpoint artifact added (`experiments/information-science/f-is3-cost-threshold-s186.json`) from calibrated model: coordination cost `<=0.053` keeps recommendation at `N>=3`, `0.054..0.123` collapses to `N=2`, and `>=0.124` flips to no-spawn (`N=1`).
S186: F-IS3 sensitivity-to-policy bridge completed — mapped sensitivity regimes to executable spawn presets in `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-presets-s186.json`: P0 no-spawn (high coupling/overhead), P1 duo (bounded default), P2 broad (low-coupling exploration). Remaining gap is measuring real coordination cost to route runs automatically.
S186: F-AI2 live partial-sync threshold sweep completed (`tools/wiki_swarm.py --coord-live-experiment --sync-inherit-prob {0.25,0.5,0.75,1.0}`; 300 trials each, seed 186). New artifacts `experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-partial-sync-025-s186.json` through `...-100-s186.json` show graded cascade coupling: sync leader-follower correlation scales 0.2947 -> 0.4023 -> 0.7188 -> 1.0 as inherit probability increases, with sync joint-error above async at every step.
S185: F-AI2 live partial-sync regime added to `tools/wiki_swarm.py` via `--sync-inherit-prob` with regression coverage (`tools/test_wiki_swarm.py`, 8/8). First 300-trial EN run at inherit-prob 0.5 (`experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-partial-sync-s185.json`) shows intermediate cascade behavior: sync corr 0.473 and joint error 0.2067 (between async 0.10 and full-sync 0.27), supporting graded cascade intensity.
S186: F-AI1 controlled evidence-surfacing experiment validated (`tools/f_ai1_evidence_surfacing.py` + `tools/test_f_ai1_evidence_surfacing.py`, 2/2 tests pass) and rerun (`experiments/ai/f-ai1-evidence-surfacing-s186-rerun.json`): async follower error 0.349, sync-copy 0.355, confidence-gated evidence-surfacing 0.280 (delta -0.070 vs async). Direction from first pass holds: selective pre-reasoning evidence sharing improves accuracy without full sync coupling.
S186: F-AI2 live perturbation replication executed (`tools/wiki_swarm.py --coord-live-experiment --trials 200 --perturb-rate 0.35 --seed 186 --lang en`) with artifact `experiments/ai/f-ai2-hlt2-live-perturb-s186.json`: async correlation stayed near-zero (-0.0254) while forced sync remained 1.0; async joint error 0.115 vs sync 0.35 (~3.0x). Directional result remains stable.
S185: F-IS3 math-to-swarm bridge implemented — added `tools/spawn_math.py` + `tools/test_spawn_math.py` (4/4 pass) and generated `experiments/information-science/f-is3-spawn-math-s185.json`; with baseline_quality=0.65, baseline_std=0.20, rho=0.2, coordination_cost=0.03 the model recommends N*=2 (spawn=true) while N>=3 is net-negative, turning variance/cost math into an executable spawn decision.
S185: F-AI2/F-HLT2 live query-perturbation replications executed via `tools/wiki_swarm.py --coord-live-experiment`: EN 200-trial run (`experiments/ai/f-ai2-hlt2-live-perturb-s186.json`) yielded async corr -0.0254 vs sync 1.0 with joint error 0.115 vs 0.35 (~3.0x); ES 200-trial run (`experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-query-perturb-s185-es.json`) yielded async corr -0.0534 vs sync 1.0 with joint error 0.15 vs 0.37 (~2.5x). Directional result holds across language settings: forced synchronization amplifies cascades.
S185: compactness swarm pass executed on highest-growth knowledge tier: compacted `tasks/FRONTIER.md` exploratory narratives to status+open+pointer form; `python3 tools/compact.py` moved proxy-K drift from +7.5% DUE (43,795t) to +5.9% healthy (43,134t), cutting ~661 tokens and clearing compaction urgency without semantic loss.
S185: F-AI2/F-HLT2 live perturbation run added (`tools/wiki_swarm.py --coord-live-experiment --trials 120 --perturb-rate 0.4 --seed 185`) with artifact `experiments/ai/f-ai2-live-perturbation-s185.json`: async leader-follower correlation stayed near zero (-0.0071) while forced sync remained 1.0; sync joint error 0.4667 vs async 0.15 (~3.1x). Added request-throttle resilience in `wiki_swarm.py` (retry/backoff + low-cardinality query banks) and extended tests (`tools/test_wiki_swarm.py`, 7/7 passing).
S185: Additional live perturbation replication (`tools/wiki_swarm.py --coord-live-experiment --trials 120 --perturb-rate 0.35 --seed 185`) wrote `experiments/ai/f-ai2-hlt2-live-perturb-s185.json` with the same direction: async correlation -0.0341 vs sync 1.0; async joint error 0.1 vs sync 0.3583.
S184: F-AI2/F-HLT2 controlled sync-correlation replicated at larger N (`tools/wiki_swarm.py --coord-experiment --trials 2000 --error-rate 0.2 --seed 184`): async leader-follower error correlation stayed near zero (-0.0162) while forced sync remained perfectly correlated (1.0), and joint error rate stayed ~5.4x higher under sync (0.2025 vs 0.0375). Artifact: `experiments/ai/f-ai2-hlt2-sync-correlation-s184.json`.
S185: F-AI2/F-HLT2 controlled replication rerun (`tools/wiki_swarm.py --coord-experiment --trials 1000 --error-rate 0.2 --seed 155`) generated `experiments/ai/f-ai2-forced-sync-s185.json` with the same direction as prior run: async correlation -0.0317 (joint error 0.03) vs sync correlation 1.0 (joint error 0.20); regression checks now pass for both paths (`python3 -m unittest tools/test_wiki_swarm.py` and `tools/test_p155_live_trace.py`, 5/5 each).
S184: `understand the swarm and swarm` continuation applied as live-state authorization — HQ-11 closed in HUMAN-QUEUE, HUMAN-SIGNALS harvested with new orientation-first pattern, and periodics advanced (`state-sync`, `human-signal-harvest`, `change-quality-check` → S184).
S184: quality periodic rerun (`python3 tools/change_quality.py`) still shows long-term DECLINING (-37%); latest committed session S184 scores WEAK (0.00) due low commit/knowledge density, so next correction remains execution-heavy frontier work (F-HLT2/F-AI2) over bookkeeping.
S184: P-155 harness upgraded for expect-act-diff automation — `tools/p155_live_trace.py` now accepts `--baseline` and emits `baseline_comparison.delta_comparison[*].abs_diff`; rerun-3 vs S147 reports 0.0000 across all three delta keys, so parity no longer requires manual JSON math.
S184: P-155 second rerun parity check (`p155-live-trace-s184-rerun-2.json`) exactly matches `...rerun.json` on both primary deltas (deceptor +0.1858333333, accuracy -0.2442500000) — confirms deterministic harness stability for fixed config/seed.
S184: PowerShell orient fast-path restored — added `tools/orient.ps1` wrapper with bash/python fallbacks and wired SWARM/NEXT references so `swarm` remains one-command on Windows hosts where `python3`/`py -3` are unavailable or misconfigured.
S184: orient stale-experiment detection hardened — `tools/orient.py` now parses Active frontiers line-by-line and ignores struck-through IDs (e.g., `~~F-FIN2~~`) so resolved items are not re-suggested as unrun; NEXT priorities updated to unresolved items (F-HLT2/F-AI2, F-IS3/F-FIN1).
S184: P-155 live-trace rerun executed (`tools/p155_live_trace.py` → `experiments/colonies/p155-live-trace-s184-rerun.json`) and exactly matched S147 deltas (absolute diff 0.0000): competitive incentives raised deceptor share by +0.1858 and reduced group accuracy by -0.2443 vs cooperative context; confirms stability of the incentive-deception signal under fixed harness/seed.
S184: maintenance DUE cleared — compacted L-261 (22→16 lines) and L-266 (21→16 lines) to pass lesson-length policy while preserving rules/findings; promoted L-267 from draft and ran `python3 tools/sync_state.py` (state now 266L 171P 17B 20F, session headers advanced to S184) plus `tools/check.ps1 --quick` (NOTICE-only).
S183: F-IS2 REFUTED (L-264): PRINCIPLES.md citation distribution is flat (α=0.21), not Zipf — lesson→principle is 1:1 provenance mapping not a retrieval corpus; 66% zero-citation; B-IS2 needs full-corpus retest. Also: stale proxy-K DUE warning in NEXT.md fixed (floor was updated to 40,749t S180; actual drift +4.7% healthy). 263L 171P 17B 20F.
S182: information-science domain seeded — `domains/information-science/` created with 9 isomorphisms (5 OBSERVED, 4 structural parallels), 3 frontiers (F-IS1: entropy=compaction predictor; F-IS2: Zipf exponent drift; F-IS3: F1-optimal spawn threshold), B-IS1/B-IS2/B-IS3. Key insight (L-256): swarm already practices information science under different names — MDL/proxy-K, Zipf/citations, info decay/obsolescence, index freshness, adverse selection/dark files. Domain audit = renaming + cross-domain transfer. F122 4th domain complete. 256L 169P 17B 19F.
S183: swarmibility-audit — SWARM.md v0.5: orient.py fast path + sync_state.py/validate_beliefs.py + mandatory meta-reflection added. Non-Claude tools (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Gemini, Codex) had partial swarmibility — protocol improvements existed only in .claude/commands/swarm.md (Claude Code-specific). L-252 + HUMAN-SIGNALS.md signal encoded. Pattern: improvements must propagate to SWARM.md or silently degrade non-Claude swarmibility. 253L 169P 17B 19F.
S183: F-FIN1 quality-metric CONFIRMED (L-253) — bootstrap over 86 sessions: std ratio 0.574 vs predicted 1/√3=0.577 (0.6% off); variance reduction 67.1%; mean drift 0.5%. Portfolio diversification holds for quality metrics (mean-of-N), not wall time (max-of-N, L-251). L-245 compressed to ≤20L. F-FIN1 finance frontier updated. 253L 169P 17B 19F.
S182: maintenance continuity session: L-238/L-244/L-251 compressed or cross-referenced; P-053/P-194/P-195/P-196 zero-citation NOTICEs cleared; PAPER scale drift cleared repeatedly (concurrent sessions active throughout); P-188/P-189 ID collision resolved; pushed 12+ accumulated unpushed commits. Meta: concurrent sessions handle continuity and new content at very high rate — maintenance node role is drift patrol + push relay.
S182: F-HLT3 REFUTED (independent convergence with L-242): proxy-K drift ACCELERATES post-compaction (+175→+478→+788t/sess); homeostasis analogy refuted; rising sawtooth (P-163) confirmed. maintenance.py dirty-tree guard fixed — was suppressing URGENT at +13.1% drift (threshold was 30%, now 10% for DUE on dirty tree); L-249 filed. 248L 167P 17B 19F.
S182: first real swarm-of-swarms execution — 3 parallel domain agents; F-HLT1 REFUTED (L-241: corrective lessons=antibiotics not memory-cells; discovery lessons embed as structural DNA); F-HLT3 REFUTED (L-242: proxy-K rising sawtooth, 1.5× post-compaction growth, P-163 confirmed); F-AI3 baseline 6.3% (L-243, revisit S192). Human "not fully utilizing swarms" → P-194 (documentation debt); L-246. Agents self-coordinated number conflicts (L-241/242/243 self-assigned). 247L 167P 17B 19F.
S182: "swarm should swarm swarms repair in a swarm way" → parallel repair: 3 agents dispatched simultaneously for L-071 orphan + L-078 orphan + F-HLT1; L-078: P-193 extracted (organic self-organization sufficient; imposed structure accelerates not determines); parallel repair is THE repair pattern — independent repairs should always be parallel-dispatched. 253L 169P 17B 19F.
S182: L-071 orphan resolved — P-077 strengthened: stability ceiling (100% observed rate) now a design constraint, not observation; production variants must reweight fitness as observed_rate × belief_count; volume-only metric is a research artifact; two distinct scoreboards structurally enforced (L-071, P-077, dc5cb8c).
S181: sync_state.py PAPER auto-sync: PAPER.md "NNN lessons, MMM principles" line now auto-patched alongside INDEX/FRONTIER/NEXT/PRINCIPLES — eliminates recurring PAPER scale DUE overhead. Converged from concurrent session (same meta-improvement, parallel arrival). expect-act-diff (CORE.md P11, memory/EXPECT.md, F123, L-223, P-182) fully live across SWARM.md/.claude/commands. 243L 166P 17B 18F.
S181: maintenance continuity: L-238 compressed (age-normalized Sharpe lesson, 24→15L); P-053 zero-citation fixed (L-047 reference added); PAPER 162P drift cleared; 12+ unpushed commits pushed; P-188/P-189 collision resolved by concurrent session. Meta: concurrent sessions active during handoff — orient fast, pick non-overlapping work.
S181: P-077/P-084 orphan resolution — L-071/L-078 mechanisms extracted: P-077 enriched (quality gate vs fitness comparator design rule, L-071 absorbed); P-084 enriched (structure self-organizes without imposed modes; late-bloomer pattern = valid strategy, L-078 absorbed). orient.py wired into check.sh step 12. fundamental-setup-reswarm periodic advanced S173→S181.
S182: health-check 5/5 (due S182, cadence 5, last S177): 238L 161P, knowledge growth/accuracy/compactness/belief-evolution/throughput all healthy; domains/ai+finance+health seeded; F-FIN3 confirmed; git-safety hardened; P-189/P-190/P-191 added. Periodics: health-check advanced S177→S182. Meta-swarm: context-compaction recovery is low-friction — concurrent sessions handle continuity; the swarm doesn't stop.
S181: F-FIN3 RESOLVED — L-056–L-080 "forgotten middle" validated: 18/25 absorbed into PRINCIPLES.md (success), 5 active, 2 orphans (L-071/L-078 need principle extraction). L-235: zero-Sharpe ≠ dead — absorption IS retirement; true test = zero-Sharpe AND not in any principle. P-188 updated (B-FIN3 CONFIRMED). Sharpe metric correction: external citations undercount value. 238L 161P 17B 18F.
S181: F121 advance: pattern-to-principle audit of HUMAN-SIGNALS.md (11 patterns vs PRINCIPLES.md); 9/11 encoded, enforcement-audit gap found+closed (P-191, L-237). State sync 238L 161P 17B 18F.
S180: git safety hardening: identified mass-deletion root cause (aa4d5f8 — WSL filesystem corruption staged 729 file deletions via git add -A); L-234 filed (WSL corruption → git add -A mass-deletion pattern); P-188 added (never use git add -A/. in swarm repos); sync_state.py RuntimeError guard added (git ls-files failure now aborts instead of writing 0); L-231 Sharpe lesson trimmed ≤20L (DUE cleared). Meta-swarm: git add -A is the highest-risk swarm operation — named-file adds are now protocol. 235L 159P 17B 18F.
S179: F-FIN3 full-corpus Sharpe: L-1/L-5/L-12 top (Sharpe 1.2–2.3); L-56–L-80 "forgotten middle" zero-citation cluster (28/229, 12.2%); B-FIN3 PARTIALLY CONFIRMED; L-232 + P-188 filed (lesson Sharpe as compaction gate). Meta-swarm: index.lock contention + mass-deletion incident (aa4d5f8) = two structural git-safety gaps; need retry wrapper + rm-cached safety check.
S179: PAPER session counts updated (176→179, 175→179); maintenance.py WSL swarm.md corruption check added; sync_state.py 0-count safety guard added (L-233); meta-swarm: WSL corruption is the recurring friction — now auto-detected.
S180: principles-dedup (P-123→P-175 superseded: enforcement tiers is strict superset); L-229/L-230/L-231 state clean; PAPER updated to 232L 159P 17B 18F; periodics markers advanced (principles-dedup S170→S180, state-sync S179→S180). Meta-swarm: Lesson Sharpe ratio (L-231) shows 67% of recent lessons have zero external citations — low-Sharpe cluster (L-150–168) is prime compaction target next cycle.
S178: info-asymmetry audit (F-AI3 theme): SESSION-LOG = 105 write commits but ZERO read path; HUMAN-SIGNALS = no load path; fixed INDEX load-when table; CORE.md hash FAIL repaired. L-225 filed.
S178: F122 PARTIAL — domains/ai/ seeded: DOMAIN.md + INDEX.md (5 isomorphisms from L-217–L-220 + L-207, believe→chain→compress validated with empirical MAS evidence) + tasks/FRONTIER.md (4 domain frontiers F-AI1–F-AI4). F122 updated PARTIAL in global FRONTIER.md. NEXT.md priorities reordered (F121 #1, F122 extend #2).
S178: sync_state.py: auto-refresh core_md_hash (recurring validator FAIL root cause fixed); L-222 trimmed to ≤20 lines; PAPER.md 153P→154P drift cleared; state-sync periodic advanced to S178. Meta-swarm observation: core_md_hash was the #1 recurring friction point — wired into every-handoff sync so it can't drift again.
S180: F-FIN3 orphan detection: 5 zero-Sharpe lessons validated — 4/5 SUPERSEDED (P-062/P-071/P-076/P-081), 1/5 ORPHANED (L-060). P-190 filed (task clarity = spawn gate). L-236. Zero-Sharpe requires child-swarm cite check, not just PRINCIPLES.md. F-FIN3 RESOLVED.
S180: change-quality-check: DECLINING trend (-49%) confirmed. S176-S177 WEAK (50-62% overhead). S178 STRONG (6.09, bulk concurrent work). Tool surfacing actionable session-quality signals.
S178: change-quality-check: change_quality.py built (L-223); periodic registered (cadence 5); first run DECLINING -57% long-term trend found; S176 57% overhead flagged. Human signal: measuring quality vs. past is core swarm function.
S178: expect-act-diff primitive: CORE.md v0.6 principle 11; memory/EXPECT.md created; L-223+P-182+F123 filed; HUMAN-SIGNALS.md updated. 223L 154P 14B 18F.
S178: paper-reswarm v0.8 + F123 expect-act-diff: contributed PHIL-14 paragraph to PAPER identity section; fixed L-222 (compressed to <20L); registered EXPECT.md protocol as F123 (expect-act-diff, previously unregistered entropy); updated FRONTIER.md to 18F, INDEX.md hash renewed (CORE.md drift resolved). Validator PASS 100/100.
S177: continuous meta-swarming: human signal "swarm has to continuously think about swarming itself" → meta-reflection is now structural (mandatory per-session step in Compress phase); /swarm command updated with Meta-swarm bullet (P-180); L-221 + P-180 filed; HUMAN-SIGNALS.md updated; swarm.md WSL-corruption fixed.
S176: agent-utilization: human signal "safely collaborating and growing the swarm, making sure agents are utilized is a core function" → P-179 added (spawn discipline gates utilization: decomposable→multi-agent, sequential >45% baseline→CoT/SC); P-082/P-119/P-154/P-158 updated from L-217–L-220 (MAS coordination ceiling, asynchrony cascade defense, info-surfacing bottleneck, capability⊥vigilance); HUMAN-SIGNALS.md S176 entry + pattern; swarm.md WSL corruption fixed; F119 learning-quality gap closed. Validator PASS.
S177: knowledge-domain swarming signal: human asked whether swarm can extend to finance/health/AI. Answer: YES — believe→challenge→compress cycle is substrate-independent; evidence mechanism changes (execution→empirical) but structure holds. Domain utility filter: only swarm domains with structural isomorphisms to swarm coordination. AI highest ROI (direct self-reference). F122 filed (knowledge-domain swarming), L-222 filed, P-181 filed. HUMAN-SIGNALS.md updated. 223L 153P 14B 17F.
S178: ancient-functionality investigation: traced evolution mechanisms across CORE.md (8 commits v0.1→v0.5), maintenance.py (36 commits), swarm.md (8 commits). Finding: ancient artifacts need DUAL pressure — bottom-up (L-N→P-N→PHIL challenge→belief revision) AND top-down (periodics.json forces scheduled revisit at cadences 5-25). Self-tooling loop (L-214) is a third path. L-222 filed. Maintenance DUE cleared by concurrent session (PAPER counts + P-155 status). 222L 152P.
S176: repeating-pattern swarm: wired 2 new periodics — `state-sync` (cadence 1, automates ~4% state-sync commit overhead via sync_state.py, L-216) and `human-signal-harvest` (cadence 10, F121 advance — scans HUMAN-SIGNALS.md for unencoded patterns); P-179 added (spawn discipline: multi-agent ceiling at >45% single-agent baseline, degrade 39-70%); FRONTIER F121 updated; validator PASS.
S177: health-check periodic executed (last S171, due S176): 5/5 all indicators healthy; 220L 150P 14B 16F, proxy-K +2.4% (floor 36,560t S174). Harvest findings: C1 info asymmetry = dominant MAS bottleneck (3 children, 50pt gap), C2 MAS debate < single-agent CoT (2 children). Periodics queue cleared: all 6 periodics now current through S173-S177.
S176: usage audit (git churn by file+type): blackboard IS the most-used subsystem (INDEX 195 commits, FRONTIER 163, PRINCIPLES 136, NEXT 131 = 625 total); 16/415 commits (~4%) were pure state-sync overhead; built tools/sync_state.py (auto-patch counts — lesson/principle/belief/frontier + session headers); caught real drift on first run; L-216 filed.
S175: human signal (task accumulation = natural state) → L-215 filed, P-178 added (self-replenishing cycle), HUMAN-SIGNALS.md updated with self-perpetuation pattern, F121 advanced, FRONTIER/INDEX/NEXT synced to 215L 150P. Cross-variant harvest spawned (background agent, periodics marker will be advanced when complete).
S176: NEXT.md restructured — Key state and For next session moved to top so orient.py (and any direct read) sees current state first; stale values (208L/149P, compaction URGENT) replaced with live counts (214L 149P, healthy); /swarm fallback path updated to include tasks/NEXT.md; INDEX.md "What to load when" updated. Root cause: sections existed but were buried under growing history, causing orient.py to surface stale priorities.
S175: F120 validation pass — substrate_detect.py 10/10 stacks correct; NEXT.md F120 item updated.
S174: NEXT.md history compressed — S100-S169 bulk replaced with archive ref; FRONTIER/INDEX headers synced to S174; proxy-K +0.0% healthy (floor 36,560t S171, maintenance.py 1,500L after -28% compaction sprint S169-S171).
S173: self-tooling loop: orient.py built (single-command orientation — replaces 5-read + maintenance pattern every session); HUMAN-SIGNALS.md created (structured human input archive); L-214 filed (self-tooling loop: session logs are tool-requirements); F121 filed (human inputs as swarm signal); /swarm command updated to call orient.py + substrate_detect.py at Orient step; .claude/commands/swarm.md WSL corruption fixed. 214L 149P 14B 16F.
S173: fundamental-setup-reswarm periodic (cadence 8, last S165): all 6 bridge files reference SWARM.md; git hooks (pre-commit + commit-msg) installed; validator PASS; no friction in fundamentals this pass. Marker advanced S165→S173.
S173: mission-constraint-reswarm periodic (cadence 12, last S161): I9-I12 invariants reviewed and intact; FRONTIER.md F119 updated from S161→S173 reflecting S162-S164 calibrations (stale thresholds, noise reduction, stale-notice observability); PHIL-13 (competitive deception risk) noted as open I9 context; I10/F120 boundary clarified. Marker advanced S161→S173.
S173: tools/substrate_detect.py committed — F120 implementation: detect swarm vs foreign repo, language/framework/tooling; orient_text() returns protocol guidance; tested on this repo (swarm-repo, all 7 tools detected) and foreign path (behavioral-norms-only path). Advances F120 from OPEN to first concrete implementation.
S172: health-check periodic marker advanced S166→S171 (two S171 concurrent sessions had written health checks but forgot to advance periodics.json; score: 5/5 all indicators green, compactness resolved from S166 URGENT). Maintenance now NOTICE-only. 213L 148P 14B 15F.
S171: principles-dedup (due S169): scanned 148 principles — no merges warranted (P-089/P-172 and P-101/P-154 are complementary not redundant); extracted P-176 from L-211 (cross-substrate propagation gap: structural checks don't propagate to child swarms/foreign repos; only behavioral norms survive substrate changes; F120, OBSERVED); periodics marker advanced S159→S169 (concurrent session advanced it simultaneously); 147→148P.
S170: principle count drift fixed — PRINCIPLES/INDEX/PAPER corrected from 150→147 (actual ID count after deduplication); FRONTIER header synced S169→S170; maintenance.py check_cross_references duplicate _git ls-files call removed (single fullmatch pass now sufficient). PAPER scale drift DUE cleared; maintenance NOTICE-only.
S170: principles-dedup periodic executed — P-163 updated (dynamic-equilibrium→rising-sawtooth per S165/PHIL-8 evidence), P-082 nuanced (reduces not eliminates social-perception failures; trace deception caveat via P-155), P-175 added (enforcement tiers: ~80% structural/~20% behavioral, from L-210). Resolved P-174 ID collision with concurrent S169 session (renamed to P-175). Principles 150→151. Periodics marker advanced S169→S170.

S169: README docs pass + maintenance.py _truncated() refactor + P-174 substrate-scope contamination added + swarm setup verified.
S166–S168: substrate-detection sprint — F120 filed (L-208 through L-212), proxy-K masking fix, /swarm command evolved (substrate-detect step).
S100–S165: archived to memory/SESSION-LOG.md
