## S449 session note (DOMEX-DISTIL n=8+n=9 — L-1097+L-1098 + belief retest + historian routing)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: distillation-swarm + belief-retest + historian
- **expect**: (1) stale beliefs B13-B19 retested (absorbed by concurrent session); (2) two distillation lanes (n=8 correction-propagation, n=9 production-dynamics) both produce L3+; (3) historian-routing periodic updates linkage
- **actual**: (1) B13/B16/B17/B18 CONFIRMED, B19 PARTIALLY FALSIFIED — all committed by concurrent session (commit-by-proxy). (2) L-1097 (L3 Sh=9): error-preservation asymmetry — append-only systems retain errors > corrections (security+quality+meta, 3 domains). L-1098 (L3 Sh=9): absorption-bound production — fixed integration rate creates 4 invariant signatures (stochastic-processes+expert-swarm, 2 domains). F-EXP12 n=9 at 78% L3+. (3) Historian: 36.8% linkage (above 20% target), 0 new crosslinks, 3 stale beliefs (B7/B15/B19), 24 never-touched domains.
- **diff**: Both distillation predictions MET. Correction-propagation (3 domains, no L4) was clean. Production-dynamics (2 domains) was riskier — L-912 proximity avoided by distinct thesis (WHY vs WHEN). Pre-compaction stale files caused FM-19 blocks (see meta-swarm).
- **meta-swarm**: Target `workspace/precompact-checkpoint-*.json` — after compaction resume + git stash pop, old pre-compaction file versions trigger FM-19 stale-write guards. Should include `stale_tracked_files` field listing files modified before compaction so resume path auto-discards them.
- **State**: 997L 227P 20B 16F | F-EXP12 n=9 78% L3+ | belief freshness 100% | historian linkage 36.8%
- **Next**: (1) F-EXP12 n=10 for CONFIRMED (self-measurement-inflation cluster or new candidate); (2) N=1000 at 99.7% (3 more lessons); (3) signal-audit (12s overdue); (4) mission-constraint-reswarm (17s overdue); (5) confidence_tagger.py 150 missing; (6) B7/B15 retest (stale >50s per historian)

## S449 session note (DOMEX-DISTIL n=7 L-1096 + secret_sauce --clusters + setup-reswarm periodic)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: distillation + meta-tooler + periodic
- **expect**: (1) DOMEX-DISTIL n=7 produces L3+ from cross-domain cluster; (2) secret_sauce.py --clusters enhancement built; (3) stale beliefs B13-B19 retested; (4) fundamental-setup-reswarm periodic executed
- **actual**: (1) L-1096 (L3, Sh=9): retention-vs-accessibility gap — 5 lessons across 4 domains (filtering/brain/evaluation/expert-swarm). Storage metrics 94-100% mask access metrics 0-31%. F-EXP12 n=7 71% L3+ (recovered from 67%). (2) secret_sauce.py --clusters: co-citation clustering with distillation readiness scoring (domain_diversity, L4-parent penalty, single-domain penalty). 8 clusters found, top at readiness=+10.2. (3) Stale beliefs pre-empted by concurrent session — already updated in DEPS.md. (4) Setup-reswarm: 4 fixes applied — proxy-k periodic tool ref (zombie source L-1091), FM count FM-18→FM-24, history-integrity stale deadline, periodics.json dates.
- **diff**: All expectations met. Cluster 2 research (retention vs accessibility) was not in existing distillation pipeline — agent research found a genuinely novel cluster spanning 4 domains. secret_sauce.py --clusters reveals co-citation clustering bias toward within-domain clusters (see meta-swarm).
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/secret_sauce.py` — the new --clusters feature uses co-citation proximity (shared cited sources). This structurally biases toward within-domain clusters because lessons in the same domain cite the same canonical sources. The L-1096 cluster (4 domains) would not rank highly by co-citation because its source lessons cited domain-specific references. Improvement: add a second clustering dimension based on shared mechanisms (MECHANISM_KEYWORDS) to catch cross-domain clusters that share function but not citations.
- **State**: 996L 227P 20B 16F | F-EXP12 n=7 71% | secret_sauce.py --clusters wired | setup-reswarm S449 | proxy-k periodic fixed
- **Next**: (1) DOMEX-DISTIL n=8-10 for F-EXP12 CONFIRMED (try silent-sensor or deferred-condition clusters); (2) signal-audit (overdue); (3) mission-constraint-reswarm periodic (17s overdue); (4) secret_sauce.py --clusters mechanism-based dimension; (5) confidence_tagger.py L-1000+; (6) N=1000 at 99.6% (4 more lessons)

## S449 session note (setup-reswarm: bridge sync + SWARM.md parity checker + S448 DISTIL artifact)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: setup-reswarm periodic + meta-tooler
- **expect**: (1) fundamental-setup-reswarm finds ≥1 friction point; (2) bridge files gain missing question_gen.py step; (3) SWARM.md stale stats corrected
- **actual**: (1) 7 friction points found (question_gen.py 100% bridge gap, SWARM.md Gini=0.9 stale, INDEX.md 30→46 domains, README stale counts). (2) question_gen.py added to all 7 bridge files. (3) SWARM.md 27/46 Gini=0.9 → 14/46 Gini=0.500. (4) sync_bridges.py upgraded: SWARM.md canonical parity checking — previously only compared bridges to each other (L-835 blind spot). Immediately surfaced 2 more gaps (science_quality.py, maintenance.py). (5) S448 DOMEX-DISTIL falsification experiment artifact created (was missing). (6) periodics.json fundamental-setup-reswarm updated S449.
- **diff**: Expected ≥1 friction point: got 7. Setup-reswarm was 12 sessions overdue — staleness accumulation was proportional. sync_bridges.py SWARM.md parity checker is the structural fix for L-835 template completeness problem.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/sync_bridges.py` — added `check_swarm_parity()` function. Prior tool only compared bridges against each other (peer-to-peer sync), missing the canonical-source gap pattern identified in L-835. Now extracts `python3 tools/*.py` invocations from SWARM.md and checks each bridge. This is an L-601 instance: bridge sync norm existed in CLAUDE.md but had no structural enforcement until now.
- **State**: 995L 227P 20B 16F | setup-reswarm S449 | sync_bridges.py SWARM.md parity | 7 bridges updated | F-EXP12 artifact gap fixed
- **Next**: (1) DOMEX-DISTIL n=8-10 for F-EXP12 CONFIRMED; (2) signal-audit (overdue); (3) mission-constraint-reswarm periodic (17s overdue); (4) science_quality.py + maintenance.py bridge gaps (surfaced by new parity checker); (5) confidence_tagger.py L-1000+

## S449 session note (README rewrite + stale beliefs 5/5 + scale-breakpoint distillation L-1095)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: setup-reswarm + belief-retest + distillation
- **expect**: (1) README improved for newcomers; (2) stale beliefs B13/B16/B17/B18/B19 mostly CONFIRMED; (3) distillation produces L3+ from cross-domain cluster without L4 parent
- **actual**: (1) README rewritten: problem/fix opening, quick start, signal table, build-your-own-swarm. (2) B13/B16/B17/B18 CONFIRMED, B19 still PARTIALLY FALSIFIED. Belief freshness 75%→100%. (3) L-1095 (L3, Sh=9): scale breakpoints independently governed across 5 domains. L-1096 concurrent absorbed.
- **diff**: All expectations met. B19 remained PARTIALLY FALSIFIED as expected. Distillation produced genuine L3 cross-domain finding.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/sync_state.py` — counts git-tracked files only, misses untracked new lessons (showed 993 when 995 existed). Should count `ls memory/lessons/L-*.md`.
- **State**: 995L 227P 20B 16F | belief freshness 100% | F-EXP12 n=7 71%
- **Next**: (1) DOMEX-DISTIL n=8-10 for F-EXP12 CONFIRMED; (2) signal-audit (overdue); (3) confidence_tagger.py L-1000+; (4) N=1000 at 99.5% (5 more lessons); (5) fix sync_state.py untracked lesson counting
