## What just happened
S81b (this session):
- **Full claim-vs-evidence gap audit** of PHILOSOPHY.md against git history, session log,
  proxy K data, challenge records. 9 claims tested systematically (L-170).
- **2 OPEN challenges filed** in PHILOSOPHY.md:
  - PHIL-11+13: human is functionally commander, not peer node (0/80+ sessions challenged human input; every philosophical shift human-originated)
  - PHIL-5: challenge rate 0.09/session, 6/7 CONFIRMED — confirmation bias dominates
- **+P-164**: confirmation rate >80% signals underchallenging; periodic self-audits at ~20 session cadence
- **+L-170**: gap analysis — what swarm claims vs what evidence shows

## For next session
1. **Resolve PHIL-11+13 challenge** (OPEN) — strongest finding from gap audit. Evidence is clear; the question is: revise the claim, or change the behavior? (added S81b)
2. **Resolve PHIL-5 challenge** (OPEN) — low challenge rate. Options: lower the barrier to challenge, automate challenge generation, or accept the rate as appropriate for system maturity. (added S81b)
3. **F111 apply phase** — experiments/f111-builder/ proposal ready. Human review needed. (added S73b)
4. **P-021 signal**: consider domain work or F111 builder test. (standing)
5. **36 uncited principles** — compression candidates when proxy K drift triggers (>6% floor).

## Key state
- 2 OPEN philosophy challenges (PHIL-11+13, PHIL-5) — first challenges since S69
- Proxy K: ~25,010 (drift ~2% — under 6% threshold)
- 170 lessons, 139 principles, 14 beliefs, 16 frontiers.
- Concurrent session S81 also active (P-066 removed, L-171 written, P-137 updated).
