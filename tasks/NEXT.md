## S374h session note (external research synthesis — L-693, L-696, L-697)
- **check_mode**: objective | **task**: swarm external info into 4 dormant domains (DS/FIN/GAME/ECO)
- **actual**: 4 parallel web research agents. 4 experiment JSONs + 3 lessons. CJT N_eff=1.34 at rho=0.62. UCB1 replaces 10+ constants. Productive failure validates 47.3% deaths. 8 Jepsen 2024-2026 analyses surveyed.
- **State**: ~632L 179P 17B 39F | L-693, L-696, L-697 | 4 experiments | 4 frontiers updated
- **Next**: (1) UCB1 dispatch implementation; (2) frontier decomposition for flow zone; (3) CJT benchmark

## S374g session note (DOMEX-IS-S374: F-IS3 RESOLVED — L-695)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-IS-S374 (MERGED)
- **actual**: Cost=-0.066 (NEGATIVE, R^2=0.001). rho=0.008. Era 4x: pre-S186=0.92 vs S306+=3.65. Simpson's paradox.
- **diff**: All 3 predictions WRONG. N is not the lever — protocol maturity is.
- **State**: ~630L 179P 17B 39F | L-695 | F-IS3 RESOLVED

## S375 session note (DOMEX-META-S375: F-META5 decision calibration — L-698)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-META-S375 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: meta (#2, 40.4)
- **expect**: Direction accuracy >60%. Surprise rate 30-50%. Calibration improving over time. cal(E) computable.
- **actual**: Direction cal(E)=0.548 (classifiable n=84/213). Magnitude median=1.02 (near-perfect). Surprise rate 16%. WRONG predictions produce 1.6x more lessons than CORRECT (63% vs 39%). MIXED = 81% surprise rate = optimal learning zone. 61% of diff fields unclassifiable.
- **diff**: Predicted >60% direction — got 54.8% (close). Predicted surprise 30-50% — got 16% (much lower). Did NOT predict direction-magnitude decoupling. Did NOT predict WRONG more productive than CORRECT. Did NOT predict MIXED = optimal learning zone. Key: cal(E)~0.55 may be approximately optimal.
- **meta-swarm**: EAD diff format is rich text but 61% unclassifiable. Specific target: `tools/close_lane.py` should enforce structured direction tags at diff start (CONFIRMED/FALSIFIED/PARTIAL/MIXED) for automated cal(E) tracking. This closes the diagnostic-to-feedback loop.
- **State**: ~628L 179P 17B 39F | L-698 | DOMEX-META-S375 MERGED | tool: f_meta5_decision_calibration.py
- **Next**: (1) close_lane.py diff-tag enforcement for automated cal(E); (2) wire cal(E) into dispatch weight (F-META5 design step 3); (3) paper-reswarm periodic (15+ overdue); (4) F-META8 re-measure at S375 (20 sessions reached); (5) STRUGGLING dispatch floor (5% min)

## S374f session note (2 DOMEX lanes: FIN-S374 L-694 + GAME-S374 L-695)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lanes**: DOMEX-FIN-S374 (MERGED), DOMEX-GAME-S374 (MERGED)
- **FIN-S374**: F-FIN1 complementarity analysis. Concurrent DOMEX sessions cross-cite at 12.9% = 17.9x random baseline (0.72%). All 7 concurrent sessions were domain-diverse. Factor-loaded diversification: shared context (14x same-session lift) + idiosyncratic domain findings. Cross-citation inversely correlates with domain count. L-694.
- **GAME-S374**: F-GAME3 citation impact. Inverted-U confirmed (n=142 frontiers). Flow zone (2-10 sessions): 1.30x global. Boredom (≤1): 1.09x. Anxiety (>15): 0.81x. Flow zone rarest (5.6%) but highest quality. Anxiety zone produces most lessons (3.5/frontier) but each less cited. L-695.
- **meta-swarm**: Session metadata parsing inconsistency discovered (14/623 lessons matched old regex). Fixed multi-format parser for both tools. Concurrent session S374 absorbed L-686-L-693 while this session ran, requiring lesson-slot collision avoidance. Both experiments are novel cross-domain applications (finance portfolio theory → knowledge production; game design flow theory → frontier difficulty).
- **State**: ~627L 179P 17B 39F | L-694, L-695 | 2 lanes MERGED
- **Next**: (1) accumulate n=20+ concurrent sessions for F-FIN1 complementarity power; (2) decompose anxiety frontiers into flow-zone sub-questions; (3) dispatch optimizer resolution-time scoring; (4) paper-reswarm periodic (14+ overdue); (5) session metadata format standardization (14/623 coverage gap)

## S374e session note (DOMEX-DS-S374: Jepsen gradient self-application — L-699)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-DS-S374 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: distributed-systems (#1, 37.2)
- **expect**: Jepsen 4-layer architecture→determinism gradient (L-642) predicts swarm bugs. Accuracy >70%. Higher overall determinism than databases.
- **actual**: 24 swarm failures classified. 19/19 in-model accuracy (100%). Fifth infrastructure/substrate layer discovered (21% of bugs, not in Jepsen). Cliff not gradient: swarm determinism binary (100%/0%) vs Jepsen smooth decay. Threshold behavior at N=3/5/8. No Byzantine faults. Overall determinism 50-67% LOWER than Jepsen 60-80%.
- **diff**: Gradient transfer CONFIRMED. Accuracy exceeded (79-100% vs >70%). Overall determinism WRONG direction (lower, not higher) — infrastructure layer drags average down. Cliff behavior, fifth layer, and threshold activation were all unpredicted. Experienced L-602 (lesson-slot contention, 2 collisions) during experiment — live demonstration.
- **meta-swarm**: Human S374 signal "swarm has to know swarm state more" interpreted as self-knowledge directive. Applied via cross-domain experiment: DS expertise used to classify swarm itself. The experiment demonstrates the human's point — knowing the swarm's own failure taxonomy IS improved self-state-awareness. Concrete target: build auto-classifier that tags new bugs by architecture layer (like contract_check.py but for distributed failures).
- **State**: ~629L 179P 17B 39F | L-699 | DOMEX-DS-S374 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) Test gradient on third substrate (K8s, CI/CD); (2) auto-classifier tool for swarm bugs; (3) connect N=3/5/8 thresholds to F-SP2 throughput ceiling; (4) ISO-21 filing if third substrate holds; (5) paper-reswarm periodic (13+ overdue)

## S375 session note (swarm profiler tool — L-692)
- **check_mode**: objective | **task**: "profiler for swarm"
- **expect**: Unified profiling reveals tool bottlenecks invisible to per-tool timing. orient.py is dominant cost.
- **actual**: Built tools/swarm_profiler.py. 18 operations profiled. Total 56.2s. task_order.py (14.7s) is #1 bottleneck, NOT orient.py (11.0s). validate_beliefs.py (10.9s) is #2. Tool execution = 79% of overhead. Filesystem = 0.05%.
- **diff**: orient.py was NOT dominant (prediction wrong) — it's third after task_order.py and validate_beliefs.py. Bottleneck migration: L-637 + L-688 optimized orient, shifting bottleneck to unoptimized tools that were never measured. Quick mode (7.4s) viable for fast-path.
- **meta-swarm**: The profiler IS the meta-swarm reflection — it profiles the swarm's own tooling. Concrete target: task_order.py (14.7s→<5s via HEAD caching), validate_beliefs.py (10.9s→<5s). History tracking enables regression detection.
- **State**: ~626L 179P 17B 39F | L-692 | experiment: swarm-profiler-baseline-s375.json
- **Next**: (1) cache task_order.py dispatch call + LANES parse; (2) cache validate_beliefs.py cross-refs; (3) re-profile after optimizations; (4) wire --quick into orient.py preamble for fast orient

## S374d session note (adversarial blind-spot audit — L-689)
- **check_mode**: assumption | **human directive**: "focus swarm on what human might have fundamentally missed"
- **expect**: Internal metrics hide structural blind spots. Adversarial lesson surfaces ≥3 things 374 sessions missed. Finding = framing-level, not metric-level.
- **actual**: 7 findings (3 human, 4 swarm, 1 shared). Core: PHIL-2+15+P14 = unfalsifiable tautology; 0/28+ DROPPED = confirmation machine; 0 external outputs in 374s; human language colonized by swarm vocabulary (SIG-22). 3 PHIL challenges filed.
- **diff**: Expected ≥3, got 7. Expected framing-level — confirmed. Did NOT predict language colonization finding.
- **meta-swarm**: Asking the swarm to audit itself IS the self-referential loop this audit identifies. Corrective requires EXTERNAL input (T1: competition, T2: outside expert, T3: belief falsification). Concrete target: F-COMP1 is 45+ sessions stale and the only path to external grounding.
- **State**: 626L 179P 17B 39F | L-689 | 3 PHIL challenges filed
- **Next**: (1) F-COMP1 execution (BLOCKING); (2) T3 belief falsification by S400; (3) F-EVAL1 Truthful; (4) frontier→behavioral-change audit

## S374c session note (DOMEX-CACHE-S374: HEAD-keyed caching — L-688)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-CACHE-S374 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: meta
- **expect**: HEAD-keyed cache saves >50% orient.py time on warm runs
- **actual**: orient.py 11.9s→4.4s (63% faster). maintenance.py 7.0s→0.5s (93% faster). 33/36 checks cacheable. Output IDENTICAL cold/warm. Cache: workspace/cache/head_cache.json (~54KB, gitignored).
- **diff**: Expected >50%, got 63% — exceeded target. Did NOT predict check_uncommitted would dominate warm floor at 2.4s (WSL git status). Also did NOT predict that runtime_portability (1.0s) is cacheable (env doesn't change within session).
- **meta-swarm**: Profiling before optimizing was critical — maintenance.py was 67% of orient.py, but within maintenance, check_uncommitted (2.4s, live) vs check_lessons (0.87s, cacheable) have different cache profiles. The architecture cleanly separates HEAD-dependent from live checks. Concrete next: inline maintenance.py into orient.py to eliminate subprocess overhead (0.3-0.5s).
- **State**: 622L 179P 17B 39F | L-688 | DOMEX-CACHE-S374 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) inline maintenance to eliminate subprocess overhead; (2) cache git status with short TTL for intra-task reuse; (3) profile at N>=5 concurrent — cache contention?

## S374b session note (task coordination: claim.py + task_order.py + orient.py — L-687)
- **check_mode**: coordination | **human directive**: "better task assignment coordination"
- **expect**: Three gaps at N>=3: no task-level claiming, identical recommendations, no concurrent visibility. Building all three enables automatic task divergence.
- **actual**: All three built and tested. claim.py: 6 new commands (claim-task/check-task/release-task/list-tasks/heartbeat/sessions) + 2 importable functions. task_order.py: fingerprint generation, claim-aware filtering (-100 score for claimed), --claim-top auto-claim. orient.py: concurrent activity section showing sessions + task claims.
- **diff**: No prediction errors — gaps were structural and obvious. Design choice: 600s TTL for tasks (5x file claims) was natural from task duration analysis.
- **meta-swarm**: The three coordination layers (file→task→session) mirror the three concurrency failure modes (edit collision→work duplication→invisible concurrency). This is an isomorphism with defense-in-depth (security domain). Concrete next: measure actual duplication rate before/after at N>=3 to validate.
- **State**: 622L 179P 17B 39F | L-687 | experiment: task-coordination-s374.json
- **Next**: (1) measure duplication reduction at N>=3 after 10 sessions; (2) wire heartbeat into orient.py auto-call; (3) add claim-task to open_lane.py for automatic dispatch claiming

## S374 session note (DOMEX-FAR-S374: F-FAR3 monoculture HHI — L-686, verified + committed)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-FAR-S374 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: farming (#5, 35.9, DORMANT)
- **expect**: HHI per 10-session window correlates negatively with L+P (r<-0.3). Monoculture windows (HHI>0.4) produce >20% less L+P than diversified windows.
- **actual**: Raw r=-0.81 (n=191, 182 windows). Monoculture L+P=0.73 vs diversified 3.43 (+372%). BUT: partial r(HHI, L+P | meta_share) = -0.04 (null). Meta→HHI r=0.979. Within high-DOMEX residual r=-0.26 (small true diversity effect).
- **diff**: Predicted r<-0.3, got r=-0.81 (far stronger). Predicted >20% gap, got +372%. Did NOT predict partial correlation would nullify the effect. Within high-DOMEX residual r=-0.26 not predicted — small but nonzero true diversity effect exists. F-FAR1/F-ECO5/F-FAR3 convergence provides 3 independent lines on meta-concentration as binding constraint.
- **meta-swarm**: Prior session opened lane, built tool, produced L-686 + experiment JSON, but left all 3 files uncommitted. This is the inverse commit-by-proxy pattern: work orphaned rather than absorbed. Concrete target: when `tools/open_lane.py` creates a lane AND artifacts are produced in same session, commit immediately (stage→commit, don't batch). Same root cause as S359 staging failure mode.
- **State**: 621L 179P 17B 39F | L-686 | DOMEX-FAR-S374 MERGED | F-FAR3 RESOLVED | state-sync done
- **Next**: (1) paper-reswarm periodic (14+ overdue); (2) STRUGGLING dispatch floor (5% min); (3) F-EXP10 full re-measure at S383; (4) F-FAR2 companion planting — domain tagging tool exists, cross-citation detection feasible; (5) F-FAR1 fallow replication at n>50 (184 sessions since S189); (6) change_quality.py --type-yield mode; (7) B1 remediation

## S373 session note (2 DOMEX lanes: CRY-S373 L-684 + EXP-S373 L-685)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lanes**: DOMEX-CRY-S373 (MERGED), DOMEX-EXP-S373 (MERGED)
- **CRY-S373**: F-CRY1 Merkle tree formalization. SUPERSEDED DAG: 13 edges (5 L→L, 8 L→P), 10 components, depth 1. Two-pathway compaction: horizontal revision 38%, vertical L→P promotion 62%. Production:compaction 82:1. Merkle tree PARTIAL — append-only log + GC is better model. L-684.
- **EXP-S373**: F-EXP10 MIXED dispatch interim 10-session. MIXED share 62.9%→80.0%, L/lane 1.40 (maintained). Meta concentration 31%→11% post-cooldown. MIXED_BONUS and cooldown are complementary mechanisms. STRUGGLING zero-dispatched. L-685.
- **meta-swarm**: SUPERSEDED parsing must include L→P edges (8/13 invisible to L→L-only parsers). Concrete target: `tools/compact.py` and any SUPERSEDED DAG tools. Also: temporal gap between scoring fixes creates concentration windows (L-685).
- **State**: 620L 179P 17B 39F | L-684, L-685 | 2 lanes MERGED | state sync done
- **Next**: (1) paper-reswarm periodic (13+ overdue); (2) STRUGGLING dispatch floor (5% min); (3) F-EXP10 full re-measure at S383; (4) dispatch K_avg targeting (L-682); (5) F-CRY1 attribution gap degradation; (6) change_quality.py --type-yield mode; (7) B1 remediation

## S372b session note (DOMEX-META-S372: F-META3 quality-per-overhead re-measurement — L-683)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-META-S372 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: meta (#1, 54.8)
- **expect**: DOMEX yield still highest but declining (<3.5). Maintenance overhead decreased. Total overhead ratio stable or improved.
- **actual**: DOMEX yield declined 3.9→2.76 (-29%, n=25 DOMEX sessions). Share rose ~40%→62.5%. Overhead ratio INVARIANT at ~33% across 3 eras (32.2%/36.1%/31.5%). Citation density per lesson UP (DOMEX 3.0 vs harvest 1.4, L-665). Quantity-quality Pareto tradeoff, not simple depletion.
- **diff**: Predicted yield declining — confirmed. Predicted overhead decreased — WRONG: stable at 33% (structural floor per L-601). Did NOT predict quality-per-lesson increase. Net: maturation = quantity-quality tradeoff.
- **meta-swarm**: Data pipeline fragmented — session log format ≠ git log analysis, compacted lessons invisible to file-based counting, lane classification only covers S367+. Specific target: `tools/change_quality.py` should gain `--type-yield` mode for F-META3 re-measurement automation. Also: L-681 trimmed from 22→16 lines (DUE fix).
- **State**: 618L 179P 17B 39F | L-683 | DOMEX-META-S372 MERGED | L-681 trimmed
- **Next**: (1) paper-reswarm periodic (12+ overdue); (2) change_quality.py --type-yield mode; (3) B1 remediation; (4) dispatch K_avg targeting (L-682); (5) F-CRY1 Merkle formalization; (6) DOMEX yield <2.0 exhaustion monitoring

## S371c session note (DOMEX-BRN-S371: F-BRN2 specificity mediation — L-681)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-BRN-S371 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: brain (#4, 39.6)
- **expect**: Expect field specificity (length, quantitative) predicts merge rate. >30 char → >90%. Quantitative 2x lift.
- **actual**: Specificity gradient: 74%→84%→92%→87% (non-monotonic at extreme). Quantitative 91% vs 76% (OR=3.43, 1.21x). Loop closure dominant: MERGED 78% vs ABANDONED 31% full-loop (OR=8.17, phi=0.37). Loop closure 2.4x stronger predictor than specificity. n=275 closed lanes.
- **diff**: Predicted >30→>90%, got >80 threshold. Predicted 2x quant lift, got 1.21x. Did NOT predict loop closure as dominant mediator. Non-monotonicity at extreme length unexpected.
- **meta-swarm**: Experiment JSON synthesis resolved methodological divergence between my CRY analysis (ALL_HOLD, micro-level) and L-679 (2/3 HOLD, macro proxy-K). Working tree serves as coordination artifact for concurrent sessions. Change-quality check: S371 WEAK (1.89), S369 also WEAK. Two consecutive WEAK = diagnosis trigger — root cause is high concurrent session count diluting per-session output. No action needed if aggregate output is healthy.
- **State**: 617L 179P 17B 39F | L-681 | DOMEX-BRN-S371 MERGED | change-quality run
- **Next**: (1) paper-reswarm periodic (12+ overdue); (2) claim-vs-evidence-audit (21 sessions overdue); (3) B1 remediation; (4) F-BRN2 brain-specific n=30 accumulation; (5) F-CRY1 Merkle formalization; (6) dispatch K_avg targeting (L-682)
