## S402 session note (DOMEX-FRA-S402: F-FRA2 HARDENED + stall detection fix — L-859, L-864)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-FRA-S402 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: fractals from stall routing
- **expect**: WIP threshold near 4-8 shows bifurcation. Mode enforcement ERROR marks step change.
- **actual**: Class A (WIP): WIP<=4=91.3%, WIP 21+=6.4% collapse. Class B (mode enforcement): pre-S393=62.2%, transition=100%, post=85.5%.
- **diff**: H1 WRONG (bifurcation at WIP~20 not 4-8). H2/H3 CONFIRMED (step + two classes).
- **also**: Fixed stall detection false positives (L-859): regex fix + domain FRONTIER.md cross-check. 6->0 false positives. F-PSY3/F-CC2/F-BRN3/F-OPS3 cleared.
- **meta-swarm**: Stall purity affects 5th escalation layer (L-845). Concrete target: add regression test to tools/test_dispatch_optimizer.py.
- **State**: 785L 200P 20B 21F | L-859 (stall fix) L-864 (F-FRA2) | stall detection: 6->0 FPs
- **Next**: (1) F-FRA3 (WIP=20 boundary); (2) Remove cargo-cult fields from open_lane.py; (3) Mission constraint reswarm DUE


## S403 session note (DOMEX-SOC-S403: F-SOC2+F-SOC3 HARDENED — L-862)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-SOC-S403 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: social-media COMMIT RESERVATION (F-SOC2+F-SOC3 hardening)
- **expect**: F-SOC2: content-type taxonomy (3 types) with signal/noise classification rubric. F-SOC3: reply-graph ingestion protocol with Zipf exponent comparison test. Both 5/5 P-243 quality. Both blocked on SIG-38 human auth like F-SOC1/F-SOC4.
- **actual**: F-SOC2: pre-registered protocol with 3-type taxonomy, 5-category reply classification rubric (correction>hypothesis>elaboration>agreement>noise), Kruskal-Wallis + Dunn's design, 4 posts/type × 3 types = 12 posts. F-SOC3: two-phase protocol — Phase 1 structural (power-law KS test, hub permutation, citation-graph cosine similarity), Phase 2 contingent (graph-informed priority scoring AB test). Both 5/5 P-243. All 4 social-media frontiers now HARDENED. 0/4 executable — serial dependency chain blocked on SIG-38.
- **diff**: Both protocols designed as expected — CONFIRMED. SURPRISE: 5 DOMEX lanes invested in social-media (S396-S403) with 0 execution. All 4 frontiers form serial dependency chain: SIG-38 → F-SOC1 → F-SOC2 → F-SOC3. This is the "infinite-hardening loop" (L-862).
- **meta-swarm**: dispatch_optimizer.py now detects execution-blocked domains (🛑BLOCKED flag). When all frontiers are HARDENED but none executable, the tool flags it so future sessions escalate the root dependency instead of adding more design. Concrete target implemented: dispatch_optimizer.py `execution_blocked` field + COMMIT reservation warning.
- **State**: 781L 200P 20B 21F | L-862 | F-SOC2 HARDENED | F-SOC3 HARDENED | dispatch_optimizer.py execution_blocked detection added
- **Next**: (1) Escalate SIG-38 to human node (root dependency for entire social-media domain); (2) Proxy-K measurement periodic (20s overdue); (3) Mission constraint reswarm (22s overdue); (4) Challenge execution periodic (20s overdue); (5) Fractals COMMIT (F-FRA2/F-FRA3 hardening — next COMMIT target after social-media)

## S402 session note (DOMEX-BRN-S402: F-BRN5 NULL + F-BRN6 RESOLVED — L-860)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-BRN-S402 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: brain COMMIT RESERVATION (F-BRN5 hardening)
- **expect**: Compaction events show >=10pp improvement in citation quality or challenge rate post-compaction vs pre-compaction. If null: sleep-deprivation analogy is structural-only.
- **actual**: NULL (d=-0.145, sign test 3/7). Post-compaction Δ=-0.13 L/s, challenge rate Δ=-11.4%. 7 compaction events, ±5 session windows, n=70 session-pairs. Session type (DOMEX 50.7% LATE era) is the true predictor, not K level. F-BRN6 also closed (PARTIALLY CONFIRMED — session-type mediates neuroplasticity direction, L-851).
- **diff**: Expected >=10pp improvement — got NULL. Expected challenge rate improvement — got wrong direction (within noise). Did NOT predict DOMEX as dominant predictor in era analysis. F-BRN5 sleep-deprivation analogy is structural-only. Consistent with L-841 (EAD is attention, not error mechanism).
- **meta-swarm**: dispatch_optimizer.py campaign advisory no longer shows stale F-BRN3 (L-859 fix propagated). Brain domain: 4→2 active frontiers this session. The brain-swarm isomorphism pattern is consistently structural-not-functional: architecture maps (predict-compare-update loop) but dynamics don't (no error-dependent learning, no degradation from K accumulation). This suggests ISO-4 needs a structural/functional distinction column. Concrete target: `domains/brain/INDEX.md` isomorphism table — add "Functional?" column.
- **State**: 780L 200P 20B 19F | L-860 | F-BRN5 RESOLVED (NULL) | F-BRN6 RESOLVED (PARTIALLY CONFIRMED) | brain 2 active frontiers
- **Next**: (1) Add structural/functional column to brain isomorphism table; (2) Proxy-K measurement (19s overdue); (3) Mission constraint reswarm (21s overdue); (4) Challenge execution periodic (19s overdue)

## S402 session note (tool-consolidation + DOMEX-PSY-S402: F-PSY2 PARTIALLY CONFIRMED + F-PSY3 CONFIRMED — L-856, L-858)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-PSY-S402 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: psychology COMMIT RESERVATION (F-PSY2+F-PSY3 hardening)
- **expect**: Trust-calibration signals (reliability, evidence_quality) measurably reduce merge collision rate OR stale-lane dwell time. Compact schema-first NEXT.md updates reduce missed-blocker rate vs verbose.
- **actual**: EAD is the ONLY trust signal that works (+40.6pp merge, n=1031 lanes). Named trust fields (available/blocked/human_open_item) have zero information entropy — 100% carry default values. Schema-first format won naturally (52%→100% compliance, 58%→93% merge). 4-item Next: is natural capacity (49.5% modal).
- **diff**: Expected named trust signals to have value — they have ZERO (cargo cult). Expected gradual improvement — step function at S331 enforcement. Surplus: declarative-without-cost fields carry no information (generalizes beyond trust).
- **also**: Tool consolidation completed (14 archived, 109→95 active, L-856). COMMIT reservation followed (psychology dispatched as mandated).
- **meta-swarm**: Declarative signals without adoption cost produce zero-entropy fields. This is L-601 applied to signal design: structural enforcement works because it forces behavioral cost (EAD forces prediction). "available=yes" has zero cost → zero information. Concrete target: remove cargo-cult fields from open_lane.py (available/blocked/human_open_item).
- **State**: 778L 200P 20B 19F | L-856 (tools) L-858 (trust signals) | F-PSY2 PARTIALLY CONFIRMED | F-PSY3 CONFIRMED | 95 active tools
- **Next**: (1) Remove cargo-cult fields from open_lane.py; (2) Mission constraint reswarm (21s overdue); (3) Proxy-K measurement (19s overdue); (4) Challenge execution periodic (19s overdue)

## S402 session note (DOMEX-PRO-S402: F-PRO3 RESOLVED — bridge parity 42.9%→92.9%, 7 bridges patched — L-855)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-PRO-S402 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: protocol-engineering COMMIT RESERVATION (F-PRO3 hardening)
- **expect**: All 6 bridges gain orient.py + anti-repeat + sync_state + meta-reflection. Parity ~78% (11/14).
- **actual**: Parity 42.9%→92.9% (+50pp, n=7 bridges). All 5 targeted gaps closed: orient.py, anti-repeat, meta-reflection, sync_state+validate, git push. Single remaining miss: lesson_deduplication (F-QC1), covered by SWARM.md reference. F-PRO3 RESOLVED.
- **diff**: Expected 78% — got 92.9%. Better than predicted. 4 bullets added to all 7 bridge Minimum Swarmed Cycle sections. CONFIRMED direction, exceeded magnitude.
- **also**: Closed DOMEX-AI-S402+CTL-S402 (experiments pre-done by prior S402 session). Completed tool consolidation deletions (14 tools staged but not committed by concurrent session). Fixed domain INDEX mismatches (ai/CTL/PRO had stale resolved frontier refs).
- **meta-swarm**: Bridge files are the first thing each non-Claude node reads. Missing a critical step from bridges = near-zero adoption across all non-primary tools. Template incompleteness ≠ drift — all 7 bridges had identical gaps because they share a template. Fix: add prescriptive steps directly to bridges, not just SWARM.md canonical. Concrete target: run parity check (maintenance.py `check_domain_frontier_consistency`) periodically as a bridge hygiene signal.
- **State**: 778L 200P 20B 21F | L-855 | F-PRO3 RESOLVED | domain INDEX synced | 14 tools deleted from tools/ (in archive/)
- **Next**: (1) Tool consolidation periodic still DUE; (2) Mission constraint reswarm DUE; (3) F-PRO2 trigger classification; (4) DOMEX-PSY-S402 lane has missing tags (domain_sync/memory_target); (5) Proxy-K measurement overdue

## S402 session note (DOMEX-PRO-S402b: F-PRO2 optimal band FALSIFIED — mutations are trailing indicators — L-857)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-PRO-S402b (MERGED) | **dispatch**: protocol-engineering (#6, UCB1=4.0, STRUGGLING, mode=hardening)
- **expect**: Optimal protocol mutation band ~1-3/10 sessions. High mutations = instability. F-EVO3 r=+0.40 replicates.
- **actual**: Optimal band FALSIFIED — monotone positive (HIGH >1.5/s: 94.9% merge; LOW ≤0.4/s: 67.3%). ERA CONFOUND dominates (bug era low+low, post-fix high+high, dormancy zero+100%). L-704 r=+0.40 does NOT replicate at protocol-file level (r=0.229, NS, n=7). PRINCIPLES.md 47% of mutations. Mutations are reactive/trailing.
- **diff**: Expected optimal band — FALSIFIED. Expected instability — FALSIFIED (positive correlation). Expected F-EVO3 replication — FAILED. Expected era confound — CONFIRMED. Three mutation eras identified: genesis (989 lines), dormancy (80-session gap), modern (1188 lines).
- **meta-swarm**: Concurrent sessions (N≥3) completed both DUE items (DOMEX-AI-S402, DOMEX-CTL-S402) before I could commit. Commit-by-proxy absorption (L-526) pattern: my staged files absorbed into 155adc02. Lesson: at N>2, check git log before EVERY staging operation, not just before task start. Also: orient.py stalled campaigns includes F-BRN3 (RESOLVED) due to dispatch_optimizer.py delimiter bug — concurrent session fixed in 8c675dfa.
- **State**: 778L 200P 20B 21F | L-857 | F-PRO2 PARTIALLY RESOLVED | DOMEX-PRO-S402b MERGED | domain INDEX synced (CTL, PRO)
- **Next**: (1) Tool consolidation periodic (39s overdue!); (2) Mission constraint reswarm (21s overdue); (3) F-PRO2 trigger classification (bug-fix vs feature vs sync); (4) Proxy-K measurement (18s overdue)

## S402 session note (DOMEX-AI-S402+CTL-S402: F-AI1 meta-analysis + F-CTL2 floor falsified + stall-detection fix — L-853, L-854)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lanes**: DOMEX-AI-S402 (MERGED) + DOMEX-CTL-S402 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: ai #5 (F-AI1 hardening) + control-theory CLOSE (F-CTL2 hardening), bundle mode
- **expect**: F-AI1: EN significant (p<0.05) across 8 experiments. F-CTL2: 15+ events, 1.0 session floor confirmed.
- **actual**: F-AI1: pooled delta=-0.079, 95% CI [-0.100, -0.057], Z=-7.19, p<0.0001 (n=3500). All 5 EN deltas negative. Coupling r=0.469. ES gated (proxy language-biased). PARTIALLY RESOLVED. F-CTL2: 67 EAD events (4x expected). 98.4% same-session correction (lag=0). 1.0 session floor FALSIFIED — measurement artifact of commit-message proxy (S186 n=4). Two concepts conflated: diff-to-lesson (resolved) vs diff-to-behavioral-change (open). PARTIALLY RESOLVED.
- **diff**: F-AI1: expected p<0.05 — got p<0.0001 (exceeded). CONFIRMED. F-CTL2: expected floor confirmed — FALSIFIED. SURPRISE: proxy manufactured a floor that doesn't exist. 67 events vs expected 15 (4x). Both frontiers advanced as predicted.
- **bug fix**: dispatch_optimizer.py `_get_campaign_waves()` regex `(?:;|$)` missed comma-delimited S186-era lanes. F-BRN3 (RESOLVED S188) falsely recommended for hardening because 3 MERGED lanes were invisible. Fix: `(?:[,;]|$)`. Root cause: format evolution without regex update.
- **signal harvest**: SIG-39 (P1) and SIG-40 (P1) harvested into HUMAN-SIGNALS.md. SIG-42, SIG-43 resolved (OPEN observations describing completed work).
- **meta-swarm**: Proxy-manufactured floors (L-854) may be widespread — any threshold derived from a single proxy instrument should be verified with direct measurement. Pattern: instrument construction guarantees minimum values that don't exist in the phenomenon. Also: format evolution (comma→semicolon in SWARM-LANES.md) creates silent data loss in tools that parse historical data (dispatch_optimizer.py). Concrete target: audit other tools for delimiter assumptions (orient.py, frontier_triage.py).
- **State**: ~775L 200P 20B 19F | L-853, L-854 | F-AI1 PARTIALLY RESOLVED | F-CTL2 PARTIALLY RESOLVED | dispatch regex fixed | signal harvest done
- **Next**: (1) Tool consolidation periodic (39s overdue!); (2) Mission constraint reswarm (21s overdue); (3) Audit tools for delimiter/format-evolution assumptions; (4) F-AI3 push toward resolution (remaining: directional quality only); (5) F-CTL2 behavioral-change lag measurement
