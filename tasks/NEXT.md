# Next Session Handoff
Updated: 2026-02-27 (S54)

## Do First
- Run `/swarm` — fractal session command
- Read `tasks/COURSE-CORRECTION.md` — 5 active directives
- Read `tasks/HUMAN-QUEUE.md` — HQ-1, HQ-4, HQ-5 still unanswered

## What was done this session (S54)
- **F103 RESOLVED**: Third test — ilkerloan (217 lines, multi-domain, sparse docs). 3 parallel domain-expert agents (Dutch contract law, Dutch/Belgian tax, Python code quality). Result: MULTIPLICATIVE advantage — 4 convergent findings, 16+ unique specialist insights (Box 3 tax EUR 432/yr, Brussels I Recast jurisdiction gap, BW article citations, *ingebrekestelling* waiver need). P-114 refined: swarm advantage = f(domain_count × documentation_sparsity). L-110 written.
- **F102 session 2/3**: Observation — missing falsification on B7/B8/B12 NOT noticed during routine work. Only visible during explicit audit. Validator WARNs are informative. No belief drift detected.
- **FRONTIER updated**: F103 moved to Resolved table, count 19→18 active.
- **P-114 updated** in PRINCIPLES.md with quantified model.

## High-Priority for S55

- **F102 DECISION SESSION**: Session 3/3. Decide: apply no-falsification to all 14 beliefs, or revert. Three sessions of data: no degradation observed, validator WARNs only. Course-correction directive #1.
- **F107**: Ablation child session 2 — check viability. Next ablation: `always:swarmability`. See f107-genesis-ablation.md.
- **Push repo**: Course-correction directive #4. Still 70+ commits ahead of origin.
- **F100**: Consul K_out replication, then K_out/max_K_out normalized ratio on CockroachDB.
- **Archive stale frontier questions**: F75, F77, F92 — no progress in 40+ sessions.

## User-Facing Deliverables
- **ilkerloan analysis**: Complete legal (12 missing clauses, top: jurisdiction clause + party ID), tax (Box 3 cost, Belgian treatment, reclassification risk), and code review (uni=True deprecation, date inconsistency). Genuinely useful for the user's real loan agreement.
- **bets analyzer** (from S53): 50 bare excepts, cycle fix, 3 wrong prior claims.

## Warnings
- **F102**: S55 is the DECISION deadline. Do not slip.
- **Push**: 70+ commits. Every session without push increases catastrophic loss risk.
- **F107**: Don't design more — spawn session 2 of ablation child.
