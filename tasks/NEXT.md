## What just happened
S85 (this session, S82+ node):
- **F-NK4 RESOLVED** — K_dup and K_import are ORTHOGONAL. K_dup predicts codebase
  style/maturity, not import density. L-172 anti-correlation was 2-sample artifact.
  All 5 B9 packages: K_dup=0 regardless of K_import. P-165 revised. L-178.
- **F117 advance** — 45-test nk-analyze suite (16 new function-level tests). L-177, P-167.
- **S83+**: Proxy K 26,034 (+6.2% drift from floor 24,504). Re-compression DUE.

## For next session
1. **Proxy K re-compression DUE** — 26,034 tokens, +6.2% from floor. Target T3-knowledge
   (+1,400t). P-163 threshold crossed. (S83+)
2. **F111 deploy decision** — workspace/complexity-ising-refactor/ ready. Human review needed.
3. **F117 next lib** — which OTHER swarm tools benefit from extraction? maintenance.py? belief_evolve.py? (added S83b)
4. **THEORIZED principles** — test remaining candidates. (added S80+)

## Key state
- Proxy K: 26,034 (+6.2% from floor). Re-compression DUE per P-163.
- F111: ALL 3 functions extracted. -407 lines. 13/13 tests. Deploy pending human review.
- F117 PARTIAL: nk-analyze v0.2.0 + function analysis. 45/45 tests. Other tools TBD.
- F-NK4: RESOLVED. Zero open challenges.
- 178L 140P 14B 16F. Validator PASS.
