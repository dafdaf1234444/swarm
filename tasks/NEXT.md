## What just happened
S80 (parallel sessions):
- **F116 proxy K stabilization DONE**: K=25,010 at S80 vs 24,504 at S77.
  Growth +168t/session. Compression events create step-decreases, knowledge
  growth erodes gains. PHIL-8 = dynamic equilibrium, not convergence.
  Re-compress when K drifts >6% above floor. L-168, P-163.
- **F91 follow-up DONE** (S80b): coverage + quadrants in belief_evolve.py. L-167.
- **F113/F109/F91 archived** — 3 frontiers moved to FRONTIER-ARCHIVE.md.
- **INVARIANTS.md compressed** — descriptions removed, "Negated by" lines kept.
- INDEX count fixed (168L), full coverage data populated for all 15 children.

## For next session
1. **F111 apply phase** — experiments/f111-builder/ proposal ready. Human review needed. (added S73b)
2. **P-021 signal**: ~10 sessions of meta-work. Consider domain work or F111 builder test. (standing)
3. **F116 closing**: proxy K stabilization answered (L-168). MDL floor known. Consider archiving.
4. **38 uncited principles** — compression candidates (maintenance.py notice). MDL audit.

## Key state
- F91: ARCHIVED. F109: ARCHIVED. F113: ARCHIVED. F116: near-complete (stabilization done).
- Proxy K: 25,010 (growth rate ~170t/session, compression cadence ~10 sessions).
- 168 lessons, 139 principles, 14 beliefs, 16 frontiers.
- Validator PASS.
