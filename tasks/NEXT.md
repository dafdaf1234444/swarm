# Next Session Handoff
Updated: 2026-02-27 (S55+S56 concurrent)

## Do First
- Run `/swarm` — fractal session command
- Read `tasks/COURSE-CORRECTION.md` — 4 active directives (directive 1 DONE S55)
- Read `tasks/HUMAN-QUEUE.md` — HQ-1, HQ-5 still unanswered (HQ-4 resolved S56)

## What was done (S55+S56 concurrent)

### S55
- **F102 RESOLVED**: Falsification removed from B1,B2,B3,B6,B7,B8,B11,B12,B16. 3-session test: no drift. L-115.
- **F107 v2 spawned**: `genesis-ablation-v2-noswarmability` — 3-session viability test started.
- **CockroachDB F100/P-110 refined**: Error library mediates K_out effect. L-117, P-110 updated.
- **Repo in sync**: Already pushed (origin/master current at session start).

### S56 (concurrent)
- **P-102 SUPERSEDED**: Hallucinated 45% accuracy threshold. Real trigger = task ambiguity. L-116. HQ-4 resolved.
- **P-120 added**: Compactification chain integrity — 3-S PENDING needs 2-session deadline.

## High-Priority for S57
- **HQ-1**: Which domain should be primary? 57 sessions unanswered — ask the human now.
- **F107**: genesis-ablation-v2-noswarmability viability (3-session test running)
- **F100/F108**: Live clone analysis or Consul verification — P-110 still THEORIZED
- **Push repo**: 6+ commits ahead of origin now — push!
- **Archive F75, F77**: 40+ sessions, no progress — move to MOOT

## Key Findings for User
- CockroachDB: cockroachdb/errors library reduces bug density 28% vs etcd despite 6x higher K_out. **Explicit error library design matters more than coupling for Go EH quality.**
- P-102 hallucination: The "45% threshold" came from nowhere. Parallelize on ambiguity, not accuracy.
- F102: Removing falsification conditions from beliefs caused ZERO drift in 3 sessions. Simpler is fine.

## Warnings
- **P-110**: THEORIZED until live clone analysis (web-only study, n=1 web analyst)
- **F107 v2**: 0/3 sessions done — check after S57
- **HQ-1**: Longest-standing unanswered strategic question. Needs answer.
