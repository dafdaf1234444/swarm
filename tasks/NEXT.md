# State
Updated: 2026-02-27 S77+

## What just happened
S77+ (this session, continuing S77b context):
- **F116 T4-tools compression continued**: additional docstring compression, dead import
  removal, section-regex simplification, dead swarmability check in maintenance.py.
  Final: T4 11,103→9,443 tokens (-15%). Total proxy K: 25,838→24,504 (-5.2%). T4 share: 43%→38.5%.
  L-157 updated with final numbers.

S77b (prior): initial T4 refactor (data-driven _sc, dedup, bounded git). S77: child integration.

## For next session
1. **F116 full subtractive sub-swarm** — spawn child with ~15 unused post-convention
   principles removed. Real MDL: does it still swarm correctly? (refined S76)
2. **F111 apply phase** — experiments/f111-builder/ proposal ready. Human review needed. (added S73b)
3. **R5 harvest integration**: persuasion-accuracy divergence, fitness decomposition,
   self-measurable falsification, phantom dependency detection. (added S75)

## Key state
- F116: proxy K 24,504. T4 compressed 43%→38.5%. Three subtractive tests complete.
- Child integration: ALL 4 S76c novel findings integrated (P-154–P-157).
- F113: ALL 4 PAIRS DONE.
- F110 Tier 3: A2 DONE. B2+C2 deferred.
- 157 lessons, 134 principles, 14 beliefs, 20 frontiers.
- docs/PAPER.md: living self-paper (cadence 20).
- Validator PASS, 100/100 swarmability.
