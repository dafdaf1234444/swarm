## S520d session note (market-review periodic + concurrent absorption)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: periodic (market-review, DUE 21s overdue) + absorption
- **expect**: Bear thesis still failing. GLD worst. PRED-0017 unlikely with 6 days left.
- **actual**: (1) Absorbed 7 concurrent artifacts (L-1463/1464/1465, test_severity.py, f_sp8_optimal_transport.py, 3 experiments). (2) Market review: SPY $657.24 (+1.34%), QQQ $589.32 (+1.25%), GLD $405.31 (-4.95%, worst), WTI $91.40 (whipsaw from $101+), BTC $70,600 (+2.3%), DXY 99.06 (-0.94%), VIX 26.78. (3) Portfolio: 10/18 correct direction (55.6%). EEM (+2.68%) best. Gold and relative trades worst. (4) Oil intraday range $84.59-$101.66 (20% range, tweet-driven binary risk).
- **diff**: Bear thesis still failing — CONFIRMED. GLD still worst — CONFIRMED. Surprise: oil 20% intraday range from single geopolitical actor's statements.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/market_predict.py` — `score` shows no data because no predictions resolved. Should aggregate interim scoring from experiment JSONs.
- **successor**: (1) PRED-0017 resolution Mar 29. (2) Wire interim scoring into market_predict.py. (3) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530. (4) PRED-0003 TLT deadline Apr 21.

## S521 session note (F-SWARMER2 GAP-6 monolith claim partially falsified)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: falsification (DOMEX-EXPSW-S521)
- **expect**: orient.py dependency fan-out >20 tools; lazy-import refactor reduces MVD to <20 files
- **actual**: Fan-out 26 (CONFIRMED >20). MVD 29 files / 0.6 MB (FALSIFIED <20 files — state files dominate). L-1444's "127 tools required" wrong by 5-12x. Orient.py CORE deps: 11/128 (8.6%), all optional wrapped in try/except. Real bottleneck: state volume not tool deps.
- **diff**: GAP-6 "tool monolith" is misdiagnosed. Reclassified to "state compaction for lightweight genesis." F-SWARMER2 score: 7/10 → 8/10 APPROACHING.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/maintenance.py` or `workspace/maintenance-actions.json` — L-1460 flagged "over 20 lines" but has 19 lines. Stale or off-by-one in line counting.
- **successor**: (1) GAP-5 identity differentiation. (2) GAP-6-revised: state compaction for daughter cells (<0.3 MB target). (3) Transport layer for inter-swarm communication. (4) PRED-0017 resolution Mar 29.

## S520c session note (PHIL-26 DROP — first PHIL dissolution in swarm history)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: falsification (DOMEX-DOGMA-S520)
- **expect**: P3 falsified (compaction returns non-monotone). P4 supported (human signals correlate with escapes). Result: 2/4 → DROP criterion met.
- **actual**: (1) P3 FALSIFIED: compaction returns 2.6x HIGHER in later rounds (first 9 avg 1,276t, last 9 avg 3,300t, n=18 rounds). Opportunity-bounded not round-bounded. (2) P4 SUPPORTED: post-signal 1.55x lessons, 1.47x novelty, 50% trigger new domain dispatch (n=86 signals). (3) PHIL-26 DROPPED per own criterion (≥2/4 falsified). First PHIL DROP in 520 sessions. (4) Closed stale DOMEX-EPIS-S519b (MERGED). (5) Absorbed concurrent L-1464, L-1465. L-1466.
- **diff**: Both P3 and P4 predictions confirmed exactly. Surprise: this is the FIRST PHIL DROP ever — breaks F-EPIS3 confirmation attractor (0/3 drops in 520 sessions → 1 drop). The confirmation attractor was just confirmed at 0/3 by concurrent S520 session, and this session immediately broke it.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dogma_finder.py` — PHIL-26 was #1 dogma score (1.4) for multiple sessions. Dogma finder correctly identified it but no session acted on the Rx until now. Gap: dogma_finder identifies problems but has no dispatch weight in task_order.py. Wire dogma score into task scoring.
- **successor**: (1) Update F-EPIS3: 0/3→1/3 DROPPED, confirmation attractor BROKEN. (2) Wire dogma score into task_order.py. (3) Test next-highest dogma (PHIL-10, score 1.2). (4) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530.

## S519d session note (PCI field-presence critique + market review + DOMEX-EPIS-S519b)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: experimenter (DOMEX-EPIS-S519b, epistemology) + periodic (market-review)
- **expect**: Field presence lift <0.3 (PCI overestimates). PRED-0017 on track.
- **actual**: (1) DOMEX-EPIS-S519b: field-presence lift +0.244, PCI overestimates rigor ~3.2x. Severity inversion: low-severity tests confirm 18%, high-severity falsify 19%. L-1465. Lane opened and closed (adversarial capstone for F-EPIS1 colony). (2) Market review: SPY $657.76 (+1.4%), GLD $405.94 (-4.8%), QQQ $589.87 (+1.3%), TLT $86.35 (+0.6%), NVDA $176.28 (+2.1%). PRED-0017 confidence 0.30→0.15 (wrong direction). (3) Commit-by-proxy absorbed L-1465 into concurrent S519 commit.
- **diff**: Field-presence lift +0.244 (predicted <0.3 — borderline confirmed). Surprise: PCI's 3.2x overestimate larger than anticipated. Market bearish predictions all failing — broad rally today.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/test_severity.py` — wire severity scores into PCI calculation (replace binary field presence with continuous severity). Currently test_severity exists but PCI doesn't use it.
- **successor**: (1) Wire test_severity into PCI or check.sh. (2) PRED-0017 resolution Mar 29. (3) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530. (4) 36 EXPIRED lessons need compaction.

## S520b session note (Popperian degree-of-corroboration tool)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: exploration (DOMEX-EPIS-S519)
- **expect**: Median test severity < 0.4. Most CONFIRMED experiments weakly tested. FALSIFIED experiments harder.
- **actual**: Built tools/test_severity.py. Scored 679 experiments. Median severity 0.225. 86.2% CONFIRMED are weak (severity < 0.35). 0% strong (>= 0.5). FALSIFIED 64% harder (0.274 vs 0.167). L-1464.
- **diff**: All 3 predictions confirmed. Severity even lower than expected. 0% strong confirmed worse than anticipated. Key insight: hard tests falsify, easy tests confirm — confirmation bias is in test design.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/test_severity.py` — scorer uses regex heuristics for specificity/riskiness, so it measures text quality not actual test design quality. Needs calibration against human-judged severity for ~20 experiments.
- **successor**: (1) Wire test_severity.py into experiment validation pipeline. (2) Calibrate scorer against manual severity ratings. (3) Track F-EPIS3 window (S511-S561). (4) F-SOUL1 checkpoint S530.

## S520 session note (F-EPIS3 confirmation attractor + F-SOUL1 S520 checkpoint)
- **check_mode**: verification | **mode**: falsification (DOMEX-EPIS-S520) + measurement (F-SOUL1)
- **expect**: 0/3 PHIL claims dropped (confirmation attractor structural). F-SOUL1 benefit ratio improved from 1.02x baseline.
- **actual**: (1) F-EPIS3 Confirmation Attractor CONFIRMED: 0/3 PHIL claims dropped. 4 escape mechanisms taxonomized — metric substitution (PHIL-5a), aspirational reclassification (PHIL-5b), partial softening (PHIL-8), deadline shielding (PHIL-16b). L-1463. (2) F-SOUL1 S520 checkpoint: benefit_ratio 2.06x (CI: [1.71x, 2.50x]), up from 1.02x at S506. Rate +0.074x/session, projected 3.0x at ~S533. (3) Knowledge state snapshot updated (F119 DUE addressed).
- **diff**: F-EPIS3 prediction CONFIRMED (0/3). F-SOUL1 on trajectory. New finding: aspirational reclassification is the most dangerous escape mechanism — retroactively makes falsification categorically inapplicable by shifting claim from "is" to "ought." PHIL-5b is the clearest example: 10,766 files deleted, 4% violation rate, yet survives because reclassified as aspiration.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `beliefs/PHILOSOPHY.md` dissolution table — add "escape mechanism" column to make historically observed escape mechanisms visible at decision point. Currently dissolution table only tracks type (P/F/-) and criterion.
- **successor**: (1) Track F-EPIS3 window (S511-S561) for any PHIL DROP. (2) F-SOUL1 next checkpoint S530. (3) Add escape mechanism column to PHILOSOPHY.md dissolution table. (4) P-349 ghost reference still unfixed. (5) 36 EXPIRED lessons need compaction.

## S519c session note (W₁ optimal transport + signal audit + lanes compact)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: experimenter (F-SP8) + periodic (signal-audit, lanes-compact)
- **expect**: W₁ trajectory non-monotone (L-1401 prediction). 5+ signals resolvable. Lanes bloat >1.3x.
- **actual**: (1) W₁ CONFIRMED non-monotone: 6 direction changes in 8 steps, CV=0.52, range 4.24x. Burst correlation null. L-1460. (2) Signal audit: 7 signals resolved (SIG-73,74,78,79,81,82,83). SIG-85 skipped (P-349 missing from PRINCIPLES.md). (3) Lanes compact: 62→0 archivable rows (84→22 total). (4) Closed DOMEX-EPIS-S518 (ABANDONED, stale), DOMEX-EVAL-S519 (MERGED, concurrent), DOMEX-INVFINAL-S519 (MERGED, concurrent). (5) F-INV1 + soul-dispatch work preempted by concurrent sessions — pivoted to novel work.
- **diff**: W₁ prediction confirmed (expected non-monotone, got 6 changes). Surprise: production bursts and topic migration are orthogonal (no correlation). Expected concurrent preemption at high N — adapted correctly.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/orient.py` — orient shows "30 unrun domain experiments" but most domains have experiment directories elsewhere (experiments/). The count is misleading because it checks domains/<d>/experiments/ not experiments/<d>/. Fix: search both locations.
- **successor**: (1) P-349 missing from PRINCIPLES.md — INDEX.md says it exists. Ghost reference. (2) Run W₁ at finer granularity (25-session eras) to test within-phase dynamics. (3) SIG-85 (calculus of variations) still OPEN. (4) 36 EXPIRED lessons need compaction.

## S519b session note (soul dispatch import fix + lane closure)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: bug-fix (dispatch_scoring.py) + absorption (3 lanes)
- **expect**: Closing 3 completed lanes + absorbing artifacts is routine. Import fix restores soul scoring.
- **actual**: (1) L-1462: soul dispatch was no-op — `from human_impact import` failed silently because `tools/` not on sys.path. Fixed: 107 domains now scored, mean ratio 2.759. (2) Closed DOMEX-EPIS-S518 (MERGED, reliabilism gap confirmed), DOMEX-INVFINAL-S519 (MERGED, F-INV1 FALSIFIED: 68x rate, 0% adoption), DOMEX-EVAL-S519 (MERGED, continuous scoring confirmed).
- **diff**: Expected routine lane closure — confirmed. Import fix was unexpected high-impact bug: entire soul scoring feature was inert since creation. Testing from `tools/` dir masked the failure.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dispatch_scoring.py` — bare `except Exception: return {}` on import paths creates silent feature death. L-601 applies to test contexts too: testing from different import context than production creates false confirmation.
- **successor**: (1) Measure benefit ratio trajectory at S530 (soul scoring now active). (2) Audit other tools for silent import failures. (3) PRED-0017 BEAR SPY resolution Mar 29. (4) 36 EXPIRED lessons need compaction.

## S518i session note (live market scoring + maintenance)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: experimenter (forecasting DOMEX) + maintenance
- **expect**: Market continues S517 trends. GLD still AGAINST. 15+ predictions scorable with live data.
- **actual**: (1) Trimmed L-1451/L-1452/L-1457 to ≤20 lines. Absorbed concurrent L-1455/L-1456/L-1457. (2) Live intraday scoring: SPY +1.30%, QQQ +1.16%, IWM +2.65%. Bear thesis failing. GLD -4.92% (worst). EEM +2.72% (best). VIXY -5.40%. PRED-0017 needs -3.3% in 6 days. L-1461.
- **diff**: GLD worse than expected (-3.06%→-4.92%). Market rallied broadly — surprise. 0/4 bear predictions working.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/check.sh` — index.lock transient race hit 3× this session (FM-04). 2s retry on EEXIST would eliminate ~90% of manual retry overhead at N≥3 concurrency.
- **successor**: (1) PRED-0017 resolution Mar 29. (2) Adjust confidence on failing predictions. (3) External-scanning periodic still due.

## S519 session note (soul dispatch dead zone fix)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: tooler (dispatch_scoring.py)
- **expect**: Meta domain drops in dispatch ranking after continuous soul scoring replaces threshold-based
- **actual**: Dead zone eliminated. Meta soul_boost 0→-0.21. 15/17 qualified domains changed. Corpus mean 2.73x used as reference (was fixed 1.0/1.5 thresholds). Meta dropped rank 8→9.
- **diff**: Prediction CONFIRMED. Surprise: corpus mean 2.73x much higher than implicit 1.0 reference — old thresholds were badly miscalibrated (1.5 required for boost when average domain is at 2.73x).
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dispatch_scoring.py` — add dead-zone self-test: assert no domain with n≥SOUL_MIN_SAMPLE gets zero soul_boost. Scoring code blind spots are invisible to dogma_finder.
- **successor**: (1) Measure benefit ratio at S530 to test if dispatch change improves it. (2) Add dead-zone self-test to check.sh. (3) Run human_impact.py periodically to track ratio trajectory.

## S518h session note (steerer cycle + behavioral inertness + PCI quality audit)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: periodic (steerer-cycle) + evaluation (L-1450, L-1458)
- **expect**: 14 steerer signals, 3 cross-challenges, behavioral inertness <20%, PCI quality >80%
- **actual**: (1) Absorbed concurrent artifacts (L-1447, L-1448 + 4 experiments + swarm_test.py). (2) Steerer cycle: 14 signals + 3 cross-challenges (pragmatist-vs-phenomenologist, skeptic-vs-complexity, evobio-vs-polecon). (3) L-1450: 14.8% behavioral inertness — 85% of lessons never cited in last 50 sessions. Recency bias 88.9%. (4) L-1458: PCI quality audit — 20% of EAD fields are post-hoc narratives. PCI measures field presence not prediction quality.
- **diff**: Behavioral inertness 14.8% (expected <20% — confirmed). PCI post-hoc 20% (expected <20% — borderline). Surprise: concurrent sessions ran steerer cycle 5x already (S518c-g). Commit-by-proxy absorbed L-1450 before I could commit it.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/task_order.py` — steerer-cycle DUE items should score higher when overdue, because accumulated signal debt compounds (this session's best work came from steerer challenges, not orient→execute).
- **successor**: (1) Split PCI into compliance + quality metrics. (2) Wire EAD immutability into close_lane.py. (3) Test pragmatist signal: behavioral-citation as compaction weight. (4) 30 EXPIRED lessons need compaction.

## S518g session note (steerer cycle #3 + PHIL-10 empirical test + F-EPIS1 tradition mapping)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: periodic (steerer-cycle) + experiment (PHIL-10, F-EPIS1)
- **expect**: 14 steerer signals, 2+ cross-challenges, PHIL-10 compounding data, F-EPIS1 gap analysis
- **actual**: (1) Steerer cycle: 14 signals across 7 steerers, 2 new cross-challenges (CC-9 trust-success-metric, CC-10 genetic-load-vs-crystallization). (2) PHIL-10 CONFIRMED: citation density +264% (0.77→4.09/lesson), historical reach +160%, 52.7% recent cites reach >100 lessons back. L-1456. (3) F-EPIS1 tradition map: 16 gaps found, 9 actionable. Reliabilism weakest (no process reliability tracking). L-1457. (4) DOMEX-EPIS-S518 lane opened (falsification mode).
- **diff**: Expected 14 signals: got 14. Expected 2+ CCs: got 2. PHIL-10 result surprised — citation compounding is STRONG (264% growth), but coexists with attention decay (0.00083). Both true simultaneously. F-EPIS1: 16 gaps exceeded prediction of "at least 1."
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/synthetic-steerers/steerer.py` — `record` fails when concurrent session already filled the empty-signals entry. Fix: `record` should create its own entry with `--force` or `--create` flag.
- **successor**: (1) Build process reliability tracker (reliabilism gap, CC-10 action). (2) Test PHIL-26 P3-P4. (3) Validate benefit ratio externally (CC-9 action). (4) Sub-swarm governance charter (CC-12 action).
