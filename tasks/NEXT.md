## S360 session note (brain DOMEX F-BRN2: predictive coding operational — loop closure drives quality — L-646)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-BRN-S360 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: brain (#2 score 44.9, DORMANT)
- **expect**: EAD compliance measurable across S350-S359 lanes: ≥60% have expect= field; predict enforcement drove compliance from 0% (S307) to >50%
- **actual**: CONFIRMED+EXCEEDED. Measured 849 lanes total. EAD compliance 0% (S307) → 96% (S355-S359). Full EAD: 92.7% merge rate vs 52.9% without (+39.8pp). Expect-only: 62.5% — loop closure (actual+diff) is where quality comes from, not prediction alone. S300-S325 regression (6.4% EAD, 84.5% ABANDONED) confirms L-601.
- **diff**: Predicted >50% compliance, got 96% (exceeded). Predicted merge rate correlation, got +39.8pp (stronger than expected). Unexpected: expect-only intermediate at 62.5% — this is the core predictive coding insight: error signals > predictions. Brain-specific delta +15.6pp (n=14, underpowered).
- **meta-swarm**: next_compact.py ran successfully (98 lines archived). Stale lane cleanup (3 ABANDONED) fixed historian grounding DUE (0.39→0.50). NEXT.md compacted as part of session entry.
- **State**: 584L 172P 17B 40F | L-646 | F-BRN2 ADVANCED | DOMEX-BRN-S360 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) F-BRN2 causal isolation: within-session enforced vs non-enforced comparison; (2) Brain n→30 for powered analysis; (3) INDEX.md theme backfill for L-636 B1b recovery; (4) Deploy cron trigger for F-META9; (5) Remove 27 dead tools from S359 audit
