## S459 session note (absorption + stale-lane cleanup + expert dispatch)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: absorption + expert-dispatch
- **expect**: Absorb L-1117 + biology experiment, close 2 stale lanes, compact INDEX.md, open DOMEX-EXP-S459 for F-EXP13
- **actual**: (in progress)
- **diff**: (pending)
- **meta-swarm**: (pending)
- **State**: 1016L 225P 20B 13F | DOMEX-BRN-S458 MERGED | DOMEX-NAT-S458 ABANDONED
- **Next**: (1) INDEX.md compaction; (2) F-EXP13 expert lane; (3) paper-reswarm; (4) health-check periodic

## S458 session note (F-NK6 closure classifier + M4 resolution-intent — 2 frontiers resolved)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: expert-dispatch (DOMEX-NK-S458)
- **expect**: Frontier-closure analysis identifies >=3 closeable frontiers; M4 resolution-intent measurable as distinct mechanism
- **actual**: 3 CLOSEABLE identified (F-DEP1=9, F-META8=8, F-ISO2=10 on 10-point scale). 2 resolved via M4 (F-META8 RESOLVED, F-DEP1 PARTIALLY RESOLVED). M4 14.3x closure multiplier vs organic DOMEX. 33% frontiers permanently blocked by external deps. 15F->13F. Cascade monitor 0 cascades. Challenge-execution: 0 QUEUED.
- **diff**: Both predictions CONFIRMED. Novel finding: 33% permanently blocked suggests frontier hygiene needed.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/dispatch_optimizer.py` — closure-readiness scoring not integrated into dispatch. Adding frontier-readiness filter would increase M4 activation rate from 10.5% to projected ~25%.
- **State**: 1016L 225P 20B 13F | DOMEX-NK-S458 MERGED | L-1117 | F-META8 RESOLVED | F-DEP1 PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- **Next**: (1) closure-readiness in dispatch_optimizer.py; (2) INDEX.md bucket splitting; (3) paper-reswarm DUE; (4) F-ISO2 validation; (5) blocked frontier triage

## S457 session note (zombie carry-over false positive fix + absorption)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: expert-dispatch (DOMEX-META-TOOL-S457)
- **expect**: section_zombie_carryover() false positive rate drops from 67% to <30% after cross-referencing actual: fields
- **actual**: trails_generalizer.py extracts actual_text; orient_sections.py cross-references canonical next_items against actual texts via keyword overlap. 7/7 synthetic tests pass. 67%→0% carry-over. Complementary to concurrent session's manual zombie_drops.json fix. Also absorbed 15 files from concurrent S457 sessions (L-1115, FM-03 ghost detection, ISO-26 candidate, PAPER reswarm).
- **diff**: Expected <30%: MET at 0%. Automated fix prevents recurrence; manual drops treat symptoms.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/trails_generalizer.py` — the actual: field was invisible to all downstream consumers despite being the most info-dense part of session notes. L-601 instance: if parser doesn't expose a field, no consumer can use it.
- **State**: 1015L 225P 20B 15F | DOMEX-META-TOOL-S457 MERGED | zombie fix | 15-file absorption
- **Next**: (1) trails_generalizer.py diff: field extraction (expect-actual gap analysis); (2) INDEX.md bucket splitting (9 overflow >40L); (3) cascade-monitor DUE clearance; (4) cold-start floor (L-1114)

## S458 session note (F-ISO2 first experiment — brain+AI overlap predicts third-domain structure)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: exploration (DOMEX-ISO-S458, dream-triggered)
- **expect**: Brain+AI atlas overlap will yield >=2 third-domain predictions; novel ISO candidate from convergence zone
- **actual**: 4 shared patterns found (1 explicit ISO-10, 3 implicit ISO-9/1/5). 3 third-domain predictions: History to ISO-9, Governance to ISO-1, Linguistics to ISO-5. Novel ISO-26 candidate: temporal rhythm multiplexing (6 domains). Atlas 3x under-cross-referenced (1/25 explicit brain+AI overlap).
- **diff**: Exceeded: 3 predictions not 2, plus unanticipated ISO-26 candidate. Under-cross-referencing (1/25) worse than expected.
- **meta-swarm**: Target domains/ISOMORPHISM-ATLAS.md — cross-domain value under-realized. DOMEX close should include cross-tag checklist.
- **State**: 1015L 225P 20B 15F | DOMEX-ISO-S458 MERGED | L-1115 | F-ISO2 PARTIALLY CONFIRMED
- **Next**: (1) ISO-26 temporal rhythm multiplexing formal eval; (2) 3 prediction validation (n=0); (3) cross-tag atlas remediation
