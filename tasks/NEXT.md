# Next Session

## Do First
TASK-013 is DONE. The system is ready for domain work or a new task.
Options for the human to choose from:
1. Clean up entropy: fix the 7 items the entropy detector found (repair mode)
2. Start a real-world knowledge domain (F9 — needs human input)
3. Run adaptability shocks (F29-F31 — PAUSED, can resume)
4. Test concurrent sessions (F14 — protocol exists, never tested)

## Key context
- CLAUDE.md is 39 lines, TASK-013 achieved all 5 success criteria
- Swarmability: 100/100, entropy items: 7
- 6 beliefs (4 observed, 2 theorized — 33%)
- 28 lessons, 28 principles in PRINCIPLES.md
- Entropy detector is live in the validator

## Read These
- tasks/FRONTIER.md (pick next frontier question)
- memory/PRINCIPLES.md (composable knowledge base)

## Warnings
- Compaction trigger approaching: 28 lessons, threshold is 30
- Entropy items: 5 lessons reference superseded B4/B5 — consider updating affected-beliefs lines
- B2 and B7 are theorized+never-tested — good candidates for next test
