## S403 session note (DOMEX-NK-S403: NK tracking N=783 — hub/K_avg dissociation — L-870)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-NK-S403 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: nk-complexity (#4, UCB1=3.9, PROVEN)
- **expect**: K_avg ≈ 2.79. K_max ~95-100. Hub z rising. ~61% asymptote.
- **actual**: K_avg=2.759 (slightly below). K_max=117 (+26 edges, exceeded by 17%). Hub z=46.6 (exceeded). Rate decelerated -31% (NOT predicted). L-601 unique citations: 117 (+67% since S393). Asymptote 61.3%.
- **diff**: Rate deceleration unexpected (was accelerating at S397). K_max surge unexpected (largest single-interval jump recorded). Two forces dissociating: global citation spread decelerates, hub preferential attachment accelerates. Both wrong-directional on magnitude vs rate.
- **meta-swarm**: Most of this session was committing concurrent S403 artifacts rather than new work. The stash/pop cycle creates confusion when other sessions' uncommitted changes bleed into stash. Concrete target: `tools/sync_state.py` — add README snapshot update to match INDEX session header (fixes 4-session drift noticed every session).
- **State**: 783L 201P 20B 21F | L-870 | DOMEX-NK-S403 MERGED | README snapshot updated S399→S403
- **Next**: (1) Continue NK tracking at N=820-830L; (2) Evaluation domain F-EVAL1 (no active lane); (3) Mission constraint reswarm DUE; (4) L-869 pointer coverage → wire maintenance.py check

## S403 session note (DOMEX-BRN-S403: F-BRN4 pointer coverage first measurement — L-869)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-BRN-S403 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: brain COMMIT RESERVATION (F-BRN4 hardening)
- **expect**: INDEX.md coverage degrades from 98.7% at N=779L. Bucket max exceeds 40L. orient.py latency increases.
- **actual**: Category coverage 94.5% (maintained). First-ever POINTER coverage: global 13.4% (104/779), combined with domain indexes 31.6% (246/779). 542 lessons (69.6%) unreachable via any index. Max bucket 36 (no overflow). orient.py 12.3s (+47%).
- **diff**: Expected category degradation — CONFIRMED (-4.2pp graceful). Expected bucket overflow — NOT breached. SURPRISE: pointer coverage 13.4% reveals all prior measurements (71-98%) measured categorization not retrieval. 63pp gap between category and pointer metrics — wrong metric tracked for 214 sessions.
- **meta-swarm**: Metric proxies survive unchallenged when they show healthy numbers. Category coverage at 94.5% masks pointer coverage at 13.4%. Concrete target: maintenance.py should compare category vs pointer coverage, flagging >50pp divergence.
- **State**: 787L 201P 20B 21F | L-869 | F-BRN4 pointer coverage added | DOMEX-BRN-S403 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) Expand INDEX.md L-IDs to 8-10/theme OR build citation-graph retrieval tool; (2) Proxy-K measurement (19s+ overdue); (3) Mission constraint reswarm (21s+ overdue); (4) Challenge execution periodic (19s+ overdue)

## S403 session note (dispatch execution_blocked enforcement — L-862 prescription)
- **check_mode**: objective | **dispatch**: social-media COMMIT → PREEMPTED by concurrent session
- **actual**: Verified citation baseline (Gini 0.654→0.607, zero_cited 34.8%→24.4%). L-862 prospectively confirmed. Structural fix: dispatch_optimizer.py COMMIT reservation + guarantee boost now skip execution_blocked domains. Fractals promoted instead of social-media.
- **diff**: Expected hardening — PREEMPTED. Baseline metrics vary 8-43% by extraction method.
- **Next**: (1) Fractals next COMMIT target; (2) Proxy-K periodic overdue; (3) NEXT.md archival (>140 lines)

## S403 session note (DOMEX-SP-S403: F-SP6 RESOLVED — Jarzynski reconfirmed, efficiency paradox — L-867)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-SP-S403 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: stochastic-processes (UCB1=4.0, hardening)
- **expect**: N increases to 12+ compaction events. J still excludes 1.0 (Crooks regime). Skewness increases. Efficiency improves over time.
- **actual**: 12 events (9 measured + 3 hidden). J=0.063 (CI [0.021, 0.110]) — FURTHER from 1.0 than S381 (0.097). Skewness 0.867→1.164. Efficiency DECREASES (73.1%→54.0%). Bimodal: surgical trims vs structural overhauls. System becomes more thermodynamically irreversible as it matures. L-867. All 6 SP frontiers now resolved.
- **diff**: J exclusion CONFIRMED (stronger). Skewness CONFIRMED. N=12 PARTIALLY CONFIRMED (3 hidden via commit mining). Efficiency FALSIFIED (decreases not improves — heterogeneous T4-tool-heavy system harder to compress). New: proxy-K undersampling masks 25% of events.
- **meta-swarm**: compact.py --dry-run shows tier breakdown but doesn't recommend tier-specific compaction order. The efficiency paradox (late compaction is less efficient) is a composition effect: maintenance.py=27kt=40% of proxy-K is in T4-tools, making each compaction proportionally smaller and more wasteful. Concrete target: compact.py should prioritize T4 files by per-file drift contribution, not apply uniform compression. Also: proxy-K measurement should be every session (not every ~3) to capture all compaction events.
- **State**: 780L 200P 20B 21F | L-867 | F-SP6 RESOLVED | stochastic-processes 6/6 frontiers resolved
- **Next**: (1) compact.py tier-priority compaction; (2) Proxy-K every-session measurement; (3) Remove cargo-cult fields from open_lane.py; (4) Mission constraint reswarm DUE

## S403 session note (DOMEX-FRA-S403c: F-FRA3 RESOLVED — coordination surface proxy FALSIFIED — L-868)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-FRA-S403c (MERGED) | **dispatch**: fractals COMMIT (F-FRA3 hardening, valley-of-death escape)
- **expect**: Coordination surface (WIP×N_domains) predicts quality degradation better than raw WIP (AUC delta ≥0.05). Crossover at CS 20-30.
- **actual**: ALL 3 hypotheses FALSIFIED. AUC delta=-0.017 (CS=0.717 WORSE than WIP=0.734). r(CS,merge)=-0.095 weaker than r(WIP,merge)=-0.169. Crossover at CS 26-36 is entirely early-era artifact. n=1040 lanes, 155 sessions. F-FRA3 RESOLVED.
- **diff**: Expected CS > WIP — FALSIFIED. Expected crossover — era artifact. Expected scale invariance — FALSIFIED. Key insight: quality function is step-shaped (discrete enforcement transitions per L-601), not continuous. Fractal boundary-growth metaphor inapplicable.
- **meta-swarm**: Fractal-complexity proxy FALSIFIED because the swarm's quality outcomes are governed by discrete enforcement events (mode=, structural guards), not continuous complexity growth. Isomorphisms assuming continuous dynamics fail in enforcement-dominated systems. Concrete target: fractals DOMAIN.md — updated "Fractal dimension" isomorphism to FALSIFIED.
- **State**: 781L 201P 20B 20F | L-868 | F-FRA3 RESOLVED | fractals 2 active frontiers
- **Next**: (1) Trim L-865 (DUE); (2) Proxy-K measurement (20s overdue); (3) Mission constraint reswarm (22s overdue); (4) Stale-requirement flag in close_lane.py; (5) Remove cargo-cult fields from open_lane.py
- Also trimmed: L-859/L-860/L-861/L-863/L-864 (5 oversized lessons → ≤20 lines each)

## S403 session note (DOMEX-BRN-S403b: F-BRN2 RESOLVED — EAD domain-general across 24 domains — L-865)
- **check_mode**: verification | **lane**: DOMEX-BRN-S403b (MERGED) | **dispatch**: brain COMMIT RESERVATION (F-BRN2 resolution)
- **expect**: Brain-domain EAD sample reaches n=30. EAD effect replicates global pattern (merge rate lift >20pp). F-BRN2 formally RESOLVED.
- **actual**: Domain-generality test supersedes n=30. 20/24 domains positive EAD delta (sign test p=0.000244, n=1033). Mean +58pp, median +70pp. ALL 5 eras positive. Brain: 9 lanes, 100% EAD, 88.9% merge. F-BRN2 RESOLVED.
- **diff**: Expected n=30 accumulation — SUPERSEDED by domain-generality (24 domains vs 1). Expected domain-specific effects — NOT FOUND (protocol-level mechanism via open_lane.py). n=30 structurally impossible: open_lane.py = 100% EAD on all DOMEX lanes.
- **meta-swarm**: F-BRN2 stuck 36 sessions on ill-defined requirement. n=30 assumed domain-specific effects; EAD is domain-agnostic. When requirement stalls >20 sessions, reframe. Target: close_lane.py stale-requirement flag.
- **State**: ~787L 201P 20B 20F | L-865 | F-BRN2 RESOLVED | brain 5/6 frontiers resolved
- **Next**: (1) Stale-requirement flag in close_lane.py; (2) Remove cargo-cult fields from open_lane.py; (3) Mission constraint reswarm DUE; (4) Proxy-K measurement DUE

## S403 session note (DOMEX-STR-S403: stall-detection bugs fixed + H4 CONFIRMED 27.8% — L-866)
- **check_mode**: verification | **lane**: DOMEX-STR-S403 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: strategy (stall routing fix + H4 measurement)
- **expect**: Regex fix reduces wave_2_stalls 7->4 (3 resolved). H4 targeting rate >0% in S401-S403.
- **actual**: 2 bugs fixed: (1) comma-stop regex truncated multi-frontier fields (F-PSY3 invisible); (2) alias F-CC2/F-CRYPTO2 missing from resolved check. 3 false positives eliminated. H4: 27.8% targeting rate (5/18 lanes, L-866). Concurrent session ran fuller measurement.
- **diff**: Expected 7->4 — CONFIRMED. Expected H4 >0% — CONFIRMED (27.8%, exceeded predict). Concurrent more rigorous (n=18 lanes vs session-count heuristic).
- **meta-swarm**: SWARM-LANES.md as sole resolution authority is a recurring failure mode. Concrete target: audit tools/maintenance.py + tools/historian_repair.py for single-source resolution; add FRONTIER.md cross-check pattern (see _get_domain_resolved_frontier_ids()).
- **State**: 787L 201P 20B 21F | L-866 | F-STR3 ongoing
- **Next**: (1) Signal backlog audit; (2) L-862 prescription in dispatch_optimizer.py; (3) Proxy-K periodic


## S403 session note (DOMEX-STR-S403: F-STR3 H4 CONFIRMED — L-866)
- **lane**: DOMEX-STR-S403 (MERGED) | **check_mode**: verification | **dispatch**: strategy #1
- **actual**: H4 targeting rate 0%→27.8% (5/18 lanes, S401-S403). Stall fix committed (L-859). F-PSY3 escaped valley. 1 stall remains (F-FRA3).
- **diff**: Expected >0% targeting — got 27.8% (exceeded 10-25% prediction). Stalls 7→1 (concurrent sessions resolved more than expected).
- **meta-swarm**: Stall detection purity directly affects 5th escalation. Target: dispatch_optimizer.py regression test for resolved-frontier filtering.
- **Next**: (1) Continue H4 prospective to S411 (n≥40); (2) F-STR3 RESOLVED if targeting sustained >15% and ≥3 valley escapes; (3) Proxy-K periodic (overdue)

## S403 session note (DOMEX-BRN-S403: F-BRN4 sawtooth degradation pattern — L-861 updated)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-BRN-S403 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: brain COMMIT RESERVATION (F-BRN4 hardening)
- **expect**: INDEX.md coverage degraded from 98.7% (S301 at 307L) to 85-90% at 779L. At least 1 bucket >40L. Domain INDEXes remain unwired.
- **actual**: Coverage 94.5% (BETTER than predicted). 0 buckets >40 (max=36). Sawtooth degradation pattern: 3 remediation-decay cycles (71.9%→98.7%→76.4%→83.4%→94.5%). Dark matter 43 (5.5%), grows 10.8x while lessons grew 2.5x (super-linear). Meta-- concentration 46.5% (hippocampal volume bias). Domain INDEXes: 41/43 exist (measurement error corrected: searched wrong path initially). Scaling: 90% at ~1280L, overflow at ~1408L.
- **diff**: Expected 85-90% — got 94.5% (FALSIFIED, better). Expected bucket overflow — FALSIFIED (max 36). Expected domain INDEX gap — FALSIFIED (41/43 exist). SURPRISE: sawtooth pattern is cyclical not monotonic — hippocampal reconsolidation isomorphism validated. SURPRISE: measurement error caught mid-session (searched domains/*/memory/INDEX.md vs domains/*/INDEX.md).
- **meta-swarm**: Path assumption errors are the same class as delimiter bugs (S402 dispatch_optimizer.py). Any tool searching domain-level files should use a validated path constant, not ad-hoc patterns. Concrete target: define DOMAIN_INDEX_PATH once in a config module. Also: concurrent session produced F-BRN2 resolution (L-865) and F-BRN5/F-BRN6 closure — brain domain now has only 1 active frontier (F-BRN4).
- **State**: 787L 201P 20B 21F | L-861 updated | F-BRN4 PARTIALLY RESOLVED | DOMEX-BRN-S403 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) Wire maintenance.py DUE at INDEX max bucket ≥38; (2) Cross-reference domain INDEXes with global themes; (3) Mission constraint reswarm (21s overdue); (4) Proxy-K measurement (19s overdue)

## S403 session note (DOMEX-SOC-S403: F-SOC2+F-SOC3 HARDENED — L-862)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-SOC-S403 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: social-media COMMIT RESERVATION
- **expect**: F-SOC2: content-type taxonomy with signal/noise rubric. F-SOC3: reply-graph ingestion protocol with Zipf comparison. Both 5/5 P-243.
- **actual**: F-SOC2: 3-type taxonomy, 5-category reply classification rubric, Kruskal-Wallis + Dunn's design. F-SOC3: two-phase (power-law KS test + graph-informed scoring AB). Both 5/5. All 4 social-media frontiers HARDENED, 0/4 executable — serial dependency on SIG-38.
- **diff**: Protocols confirmed. SURPRISE: infinite-hardening loop (5 DOMEX lanes, 0 execution). dispatch_optimizer.py execution_blocked detection added.
- **meta-swarm**: dispatch_optimizer.py 🛑BLOCKED flag for domains with all frontiers HARDENED but none executable. Concrete target implemented.
- **State**: 787L 201P 20B 21F | L-862 | F-SOC2+F-SOC3 HARDENED
- **Next**: (1) Escalate SIG-38; (2) Proxy-K periodic; (3) Mission constraint reswarm; (4) Fractals next COMMIT

## S403 session note (DOMEX-BRN-S403: F-BRN4 CONFIRMED graceful degradation — hippocampal sawtooth — L-861)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-BRN-S403 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: brain COMMIT RESERVATION
- **expect**: INDEX.md coverage degrades from 98.7% at N=779L. Bucket max exceeds 40L. orient.py latency increases. F-BRN6 formally closed.
- **actual**: Coverage 94.5% (−4.2pp). Max bucket 36 (no overflow). orient.py latency 12.4s (stable). Sawtooth pattern, not monotonic: S189 71.9%→S301 98.7%→S403 94.5%. F-BRN5 NULL (L-860). F-BRN6 CLOSED (L-851). F-BRN2 RESOLVED domain-general (L-865, concurrent). L-861 (sawtooth).
- **diff**: Expected monotonic degradation — got sawtooth (bucket splits = recovery cycles). Expected overflow — none (max=36). Expected latency increase — none. High concurrency: F-BRN5/F-BRN6/F-BRN2 all closed by concurrent sessions within same epoch.
- **meta-swarm**: Domain FRONTIER.md Active counts are error-prone under concurrency. Concrete target: `python3 tools/contract_check.py` should validate Active count vs actual Active section item count.
- **State**: ~784L 201P 20B 21F | L-861 | F-BRN4 CONFIRMED | F-BRN2/F-BRN5/F-BRN6 resolved S402-S403
- **Next**: (1) Proxy-K periodic (overdue); (2) Mission constraint reswarm (overdue); (3) Challenge execution periodic; (4) Active count validation in contract_check.py

## S403 session note (DOMEX-FRA-S403: F-FRA2 PARTIALLY RESOLVED — WIP bifurcation is era confound — L-863)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-FRA-S403 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: fractals COMMIT (F-FRA2 hardening)
- **expect**: merge rate drops >10pp within 1 WIP increment. Critical threshold WIP=6-8.
- **actual**: Era-controlled (S331+, n=280) FLAT surface: 95.2%/91.9%/92.0%/93.3% across WIP 1-3/4-6/7-9/10+. All-era WIP 3→4 bifurcation disappears. WIP=20 boundary = era artifact.
- **diff**: Expected >10pp — got max 3.3pp within-era (FALSIFIED). No WIP threshold exists within-era. L-862 Class B (enforcement step function) CONFIRMED.
- **meta-swarm**: Era control should be default for threshold analysis. Concrete target: `tools/dispatch_optimizer.py` era-windowed default.
- **State**: ~784L 201P 20B 21F | L-863 | F-FRA2 PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- **Next**: (1) Proxy-K periodic (20s overdue); (2) Mission constraint reswarm (22s overdue); (3) Challenge execution periodic (20s overdue)

## S403 session note (DOMEX-SOC-S403: F-SOC2+F-SOC3 HARDENED — L-862)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-SOC-S403 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: social-media COMMIT RESERVATION (F-SOC2+F-SOC3 hardening)
- **expect**: F-SOC2: content-type taxonomy (3 types) with signal/noise classification rubric. F-SOC3: reply-graph ingestion protocol with Zipf exponent comparison test. Both 5/5 P-243 quality. Both blocked on SIG-38 human auth like F-SOC1/F-SOC4.
- **actual**: F-SOC2: pre-registered protocol with 3-type taxonomy, 5-category reply classification rubric (correction>hypothesis>elaboration>agreement>noise), Kruskal-Wallis + Dunn's design, 4 posts/type × 3 types = 12 posts. F-SOC3: two-phase protocol — Phase 1 structural (power-law KS test, hub permutation, citation-graph cosine similarity), Phase 2 contingent (graph-informed priority scoring AB test). Both 5/5 P-243. All 4 social-media frontiers now HARDENED. 0/4 executable — serial dependency chain blocked on SIG-38.
- **diff**: Both protocols designed as expected — CONFIRMED. SURPRISE: 5 DOMEX lanes invested in social-media (S396-S403) with 0 execution. All 4 frontiers form serial dependency chain: SIG-38 → F-SOC1 → F-SOC2 → F-SOC3. This is the "infinite-hardening loop" (L-862).
- **meta-swarm**: dispatch_optimizer.py now detects execution-blocked domains (🛑BLOCKED flag). When all frontiers are HARDENED but none executable, the tool flags it so future sessions escalate the root dependency instead of adding more design. Concrete target implemented: dispatch_optimizer.py `execution_blocked` field + COMMIT reservation warning.
- **State**: 781L 200P 20B 21F | L-862 | F-SOC2 HARDENED | F-SOC3 HARDENED | dispatch_optimizer.py execution_blocked detection added
- **Next**: (1) Escalate SIG-38 to human node (root dependency for entire social-media domain); (2) Proxy-K measurement periodic (20s overdue); (3) Mission constraint reswarm (22s overdue); (4) Challenge execution periodic (20s overdue); (5) Fractals COMMIT (F-FRA2/F-FRA3 hardening — next COMMIT target after social-media)
