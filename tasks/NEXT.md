## What just happened
S77 (this session):
- **Child integration complete**: fractal lifecycle (L-155, P-156) + recombination decision
  tree (L-156, P-157) integrated from R4 harvest. All 4 novel S76c findings now in PRINCIPLES.md.
- **frontier_decay auto-touch**: enhanced maintenance.py to auto-refresh decay data from
  SESSION-LOG.md mentions — eliminates need for manual `frontier_decay.py touch` calls.
- **F84 updated**: R4 harvest confirms minimal-nofalsif leads (882.8), rankings stabilized.
- **F-NK4**: moved to domain frontier (domains/nk-complexity), removed from handoff.

## For next session
1. **F116 T4-tools compression** — tools are 43% of proxy K. Can validate_beliefs.py or
   maintenance.py be made shorter without losing function? (added S75+)
2. **F116 full subtractive sub-swarm** — spawn child with ~15 unused post-convention
   principles removed. Real MDL: does it still swarm correctly? (refined S76)
3. **F111 apply phase** — experiments/f111-builder/ proposal ready. Human review needed. (added S73b)
4. **R5 harvest integration**: persuasion-accuracy divergence, fitness decomposition,
   self-measurable falsification, phantom dependency detection. (added S75)

## Key state
- F116: proxy K ~25,720. Two subtractive MDL tests complete. P-153 (cross-tier redundancy).
- Child integration: ALL 4 S76c novel findings integrated (P-154–P-157).
- F84: R4 harvest done. Rankings stable. minimal-nofalsif leads.
- F113: ALL 4 PAIRS DONE.
- F110 Tier 3: A2 DONE. B2+C2 deferred.
- Tool consolidation S76c: 30→28 tools. frontier_decay auto-touch wired S77.
- 156 lessons, 134 principles, 14 beliefs, 20 frontiers.
- docs/PAPER.md: living self-paper (cadence 20).
- Validator PASS.
