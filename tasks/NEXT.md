# Next Session

## Do First
Run Shock 1 (belief contradiction).
Read `experiments/adaptability/shocks/shock1.md` — it targets B1.
Run validator BEFORE (record swarmability). Process the shock. Run validator AFTER.
Record in `experiments/adaptability/PROTOCOL.md` tracking table.

## If Time Remains
Dry-run Level 1 compaction on INDEX.md (currently 53+ lines, trigger is 60).
Read `memory/COMPACT.md` for procedure.

## Read These
- experiments/adaptability/PROTOCOL.md
- experiments/adaptability/shocks/shock1.md
- beliefs/DEPS.md (B1 is shock target)
- memory/COMPACT.md (for priority 2)

## Warnings
- 62.5% theorized — Rule 2 active (no new beliefs without testing one)
- B3 recently downgraded — deps already cascaded
- First session using NEXT.md — report if format works
- New protocols added this session: CONTEXT.md, COMPACT.md, CONTINUE.md, SPAWN.md — skim if relevant
