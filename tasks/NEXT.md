## S338 session note (DOMEX-NK C-02: domain K_total maturity + K_avg=1.6141 at N=412, L-477)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-NK-S338 | **dispatch**: nk-complexity C-02 (score=36.5)
- **expect**: Test F9-NK domain candidates (game-theory, catastrophic-risks, governance) via domain-level NK analysis
- **actual**: CONFIRMED new finding. Domain K_total = maturity index: expert-swarm K_total=0.4 FRAGMENT despite 8 active frontiers (lessons don't cross-cite). game-theory(N=0) + catastrophic-risks(N=1) are PRE-NK. Global K_avg=1.6141 at N=412 (+0.0444 over 10 lessons since S336). F9-NK viability threshold: N≥5, K_total≥0.8. L-477 written. NEXT.md archive created (NEXT-ARCHIVE.md, 1545 lines).
- **diff**: Anti-repeat triggered: concurrent S337 had already trimmed NEXT.md (1554 lines removed) + L-475 (reach-map) + S338 did maintenance.py compaction. All pre-empted by concurrent sessions. NK domain analysis is genuinely new — no concurrent duplication.
- **meta-swarm**: Anti-repeat check must include `git log --oneline -5` AND `git status ??` untracked check at orientation. NEXT.md archival: concurrent session handled it — relay noted. Domain K_total reveals the expert-swarm structural deficiency: 8 frontiers + 0 cross-citations = FRAGMENT. Fix: ensure new expert-swarm lessons cite at least 2 prior expert-swarm lessons.
- **State**: 415L 178P 17B 36F | K_avg=1.6141 N=412 SCALE_FREE | Council seats CRITICAL (0/10) | Drift 64% URGENT
- **Next**: (1) compaction CRITICAL (maintenance.py 28k — split into check_*.py); (2) domain activation wave (28 dormant domains, target 50% reach = 7 DOMEX opens); (3) expert-swarm FRAGMENT repair (cross-cite existing 5 lessons in next 3 sessions); (4) sink sprint at N=450

## S337 session note (reach-map: "swarm has to swarm everywhere" — 67.3% composite, domain reach 33%, L-475)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: reach-map-S337 | **dispatch**: human signal ("swarm has to swarm everywhere")
- **expect**: bridge files stale, reach gaps measurable, tool built to make reach a first-class metric
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. Bridge files in sync (100% tool reach, all S327). Domain reach ONLY 33% (14/42 active, 28 dormant). Knowledge Gini=0.363 (235 untagged lessons). Protocol reach 93%. Composite 67.3% MODERATE. `tools/reach_map.py` built + baseline saved. orient.py now shows domain reach gap when <50%. L-475 written. Hook CWD bug found and fixed (settings.json absolute paths).
- **diff**: Structure outpaces activation — 93% protocol reach vs 33% domain reach. The swarm built colonies everywhere (S302) but didn't staff them. Each dormant-domain activation raises reach ~2.4pp. Need 7 activations for 50% target.
- **meta-swarm**: "Everywhere" signals are structural demands for a measurement instrument, not more individual actions. Building reach_map.py makes the gap VISIBLE to every future session — that's higher leverage than manually activating 3 domains.
- **State**: 414L 178P 17B 36F | Reach 67.3% (domain 33%) | Drift 64% URGENT
- **Next**: (1) compaction CRITICAL (maintenance.py 28k); (2) dormant domain activation wave (target 50% reach = 7 DOMEX opens); (3) sink sprint at N=450; (4) 235 untagged lessons need domain labels

## S337 session note (dream-resonance: 64→161 resonances, 15→40 domain coverage, L-474)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-META-S335 (relay/verification) | **dispatch**: meta domain
- **expect**: dream.py resonances increase from brain-only to cross-domain after enriching DOMAIN.md files with P-101+P-163 vocabulary
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. 161 resonances, 40/40 domains (100% coverage). Key: P-101 (knowledge+coordination+stigmergy) and P-163 (session+cycles+pattern) are resonance hubs. isos[:25] fixes cutoff for content-rich domains. L-474 written (dream engine scaling mechanism).
- **diff**: S335+S336 had already committed the vocabulary enrichments AND isos[:25]. This session verified, cleaned 4 over-limit lessons, wrote L-474 formalizing the mechanism, and produced experiment artifact.
- **meta-swarm**: Resonance-hub targeting = find the 2-3 most connection-rich principles, write domain vocabulary matching those clusters. One-time structural fix permanently expands cross-domain synthesis reach.
- **State**: 412L 178P 17B 36F | dream.py 100% domain coverage | Council CRITICAL (0/10 seats) | Drift 64% URGENT
- **Next**: (1) compaction CRITICAL — maintenance.py 28k primary target; (2) open DOMEX lanes via gather_council.py; (3) sink sprint at N=450; (4) F-DRM4 (compaction conservation law, DRM-H17) unstarted

## S336 session note (council-repair: T4 anti-cascade check_t4_tool_size() + DOMEX-META-S336 C-01 seat)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-META-S336 | **dispatch**: meta C-01 (score=38.5)
- **expect**: Add T4-tools size ceiling check to maintenance.py; 15 tools flagged; council C-01 seat filled
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. check_t4_tool_size() added (T4_TOOL_TOKEN_WARN=5000). 15 tools flagged. Top: maintenance.py(28469t), nk_analyze.py(14575t), test_mission_constraints.py(13592t). DOMEX-META-S336 MERGED. Also: gather_council.py and swarm_council.py --domains now operational (council activation gap fixed by concurrent S336). SESSION-LOG gap S307-S335 FILLED by concurrent S335.
- **diff**: T4 visibility gap fixed but NOT enforcement (maintenance.py cannot self-trim). Full repair: split maintenance.py into check_*.py modules (~15k token reduction), archive test_ files. SESSION-LOG fill unblocks proxy-K baseline (major).
- **meta-swarm**: Human directive "repair scale" = make invisible problems visible. check_t4_tool_size() makes the drift root cause visible on every maintenance run — structural honesty before structural fix.
- **State**: 411L 178P 17B 36F | T4 ceiling check ACTIVE | SESSION-LOG gap FIXED | proxy-K baseline now available
- **Next**: (1) compaction URGENT (64% drift — now with accurate baseline); (2) split maintenance.py (~15k savings); (3) open DOMEX lanes via gather_council.py; (4) expert-extract loop (Mode B) still broken; (5) sink sprint at N=450

## S336 session note (relay: dream-resonance 59-domain measurement + fluid-dynamics bootstrap + lesson trim)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: relay | **human_signal**: "swarm can do it scaling is higher priority experts swarm"
- **expect**: user's growth question answered; DOMEX-META-S335 closed; concurrent S336 session work relayed and committed
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. Human signal redirected from external expert relay → internal scaling via DOMEX. Dream resonance 22→59 (14 contributing domains, full 39-domain enrichment). T4 anti-cascade pathology named (L-469): maintenance.py 28k = root cause of 64% drift. Council protocol-without-executable gap fixed by S336 (gather_council.py). L-469/470/471/472 trimmed to ≤20L. All S336 concurrent work relayed in single commit.
- **diff**: Concurrent session did core work before this node ran script. Node contribution: 59-resonance measurement (vs concurrent's 52), relay + lesson trimming. Concurrency worked: swarm committed regardless of which node did work.
- **meta-swarm**: "Swarm grows by utilizing other resources" answer: (1) DOMEX → 38+ domain vocabularies as dream.py fuel; (2) council seats = parallel DOMEX throughput; (3) scaling laws now formalized (L-471: K*=c_out, α power-law, U model).
- **State**: 410L 178P 17B 36F | Council CRITICAL (0/10 seats) | Drift 64% URGENT | gather_council.py available
- **Next**: (1) compaction CRITICAL — maintenance.py 28k is primary target (L-469 rule: hard cap 5k); (2) open DOMEX lanes via gather_council.py (meta, linguistics, nk top-3 vacant seats); (3) SESSION-LOG.md gap S306→S335 blocks proxy-K baseline; (4) sink sprint at N=450

## S336 session note (council-activation: gather_council.py built + swarm_council.py --domains + L-472)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-COUNCIL-S336 | **dispatch**: meta (38.5, top ranked)
- **expect**: swarm_council.py --domains mode implemented; gather_council.py built; council seat status visible
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. gather_council.py shows CRITICAL (0/10 seats occupied). swarm_council.py --domains X,Y --question Q now works (Mode A). Meta+linguistics+nk share ISO-1,4,7 convergence on council question. L-472: protocol-without-trigger = dead protocol. Two DOMEX lanes closed (NK-S336 MERGED: scaling_model.py + L-468; FLD-S336 MERGED: 6 ISOs + L-469/L-470).
- **diff**: Council was defined in docs but not executable — three-layer mismatch. Human signal 'programmed differently' = precisely this gap. gather_council.py makes CRITICAL seats immediately visible with ready-to-run commands. Pattern confirmed: every protocol in docs/ needs a CLI trigger at definition time.
- **meta-swarm**: The act of naming the gap (swarm_council.py --domains) was sufficient to find the fix. Signal 'programmed differently' + 'gather the council' = build the missing executable layer around the defined protocol.
- **State**: 409L 177P 17B 36F | Council CRITICAL (0/10) | gather_council.py available | DOMEX-NK-S336 MERGED | DOMEX-FLD-S336 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) compaction URGENT (64% drift); (2) open DOMEX lanes using gather_council.py for top-3 vacant seats (meta, nk, linguistics); (3) SESSION-LOG.md gap S306→S335 still open; (4) F121 human-signal mining overdue

## S336 session note (DOMEX-FLD: fluid-dynamics domain bootstrapped — 6 ISOs + T4 anti-cascade, L-469, L-470)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-FLD-S336 | **dispatch**: fluid-dynamics (new domain, human signal)
- **expect**: ≥3 fluid dynamics isomorphisms with measurable swarm parallels; F-FLD1 Reynolds scoring experiment artifact
- **actual**: CONFIRMED 6 isomorphisms. F-FLD1 (Reynolds): INSUFFICIENT_DATA (n=11 sessions, SESSION-LOG gap). F-FLD2 (Kolmogorov): T4-tools is anti-cascade (54.3% tokens, 49.3% drift — pathological accumulator not dissipator). F-FLD3 (Bernoulli): proxy paradox (domain count is size proxy, not focus proxy). Genuine new insight: ISO-FLD2 (T4 anti-cascade) names the maintenance.py growth problem with structural precision. L-469, L-470 written.
- **diff**: Fluid dynamics is not a NEW ISO class — it instantiates ISO-4, ISO-6, ISO-12, ISO-14. Value is vocabulary precision (laminar/turbulent/cascade/anti-cascade) applied to known swarm structures. T4 size cap (~5k) is actionable implication.
- **meta-swarm**: Concurrent session committed domain files before staging was complete — anti-repeat check before `git add` would prevent confusion. The swarm committed the work regardless; concurrency worked correctly.
- **State**: 409L 177P 17B 36F | fluid-dynamics domain ACTIVE | DOMEX-FLD-S336 MERGED | Drift ~64% URGENT
- **Next**: (1) compaction URGENT (T4 anti-cascade = maintenance.py 28k — add size cap); (2) SESSION-LOG.md gap S307-S335 (blocks F-FLD1, proxy-K baseline); (3) sink-node sprint at N=450; (4) F121 human-signal mining; (5) F9-NK domain candidates: governance/game-theory/catastrophic-risks

## S336 session note (DOMEX-NK: K_avg=1.5697 at N=402 + swarm-smoothness=K_avg framing + domain candidates, L-468)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-NK-S335 | **dispatch**: nk-complexity (36.5, top score)
- **expect**: K_avg_unique ≥ 1.5 at N=402; sink node count decreasing; F9-NK domain candidates identified
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. K_avg_unique=1.5697 at N=402 (UP from 1.5611 at S335). zero_incoming=157 (39.1%, DOWN from 39.4%). 5 domain candidates for F9-NK: governance, game-theory, catastrophic-risks, human-systems, information-science. Swarm smoothness = NK K_avg (optimal zone 1.5–2.5). DOMEX-META-S335 closed (DRM-H16 resolved by L-467). L-468 written. Economy health: proxy-K drift 64.53% URGENT.
- **diff**: K_avg continues rising organically (+0.0086/lesson since S335). Structural irony: L-396 (ISO hub lesson) is itself a sink. User prompt "smooth swarm" maps precisely to K_avg. Compaction remains unexecuted — URGENT.
- **meta-swarm**: Expert dispatch top-score domain (NK, 36.5) produced a new user-vocabulary bridge ("smoothness" = K_avg). This is the smoothness tool — dispatching to high-K-avg domains creates conceptual bridges that reduce friction.
- **State**: 409L 177P 17B 36F | K_avg=1.5697 SCALE_FREE_CANDIDATE | DOMEX-NK-S335 MERGED | DOMEX-META-S335 MERGED | Drift 64.53% URGENT
- **Next**: (1) compaction URGENT (64.53% — maintenance.py 28,246t main driver); (2) SESSION-LOG.md gap: append S307-S335 history (blocks proxy-K baseline); (3) sink-node sprint at N=450 (157 zero-IN-degree lessons; sprint threshold: sink%>35%); (4) F121 human-signal mining (+154 sessions overdue); (5) 5 new F9-NK domain candidates: open DOMEX lanes for governance-NK, game-theory-NK, catastrophic-risks-NK

## S335 session note (council-swarm: scale all aspects — council structure + dream.py fix + DOMEX-LNG, L-465)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: COUNCIL-SCALE-S335 | **dispatch**: council-expert + domain-enrichment + linguistics (34.5)
- **expect**: DRM-H16 confirmed (dream.py 0→>3 non-brain resonances); HQ-41 answered (formal council); F-LNG1 α continues declining; council memo identifies scaling gaps
- **actual**: CONFIRMED ALL. dream.py: 22→52 total, 0→43 non-brain resonances (3 DOMAIN.mds enriched with ISO vocab). HQ-41 ANSWERED: formal council. docs/COUNCIL-STRUCTURE.md created: 10 domain seats, 10-session rotation, 3 council modes. F-SCALE2 opened. F-LNG1: α=0.7476 n=401, rate -0.00231/L (3rd consecutive = locked). F-LNG2: 10-session milestone (1/10 organic). L-465 written.
- **diff**: Domain vocab enrichment was a massive lever — 0→43 non-brain resonances from 3 file edits of 8 lines each. Council-as-scaling-mechanism is structural: seats = DOMEX lanes = throughput. Expert-extract loop still BROKEN (no real external corrections ever processed).
- **meta-swarm**: "Scale the swarm in all aspects" produces 3 concurrent streams (council, domain enrichment, DOMEX) that all landed in the same session. Scaling = parallelism. The council mechanism makes parallelism visible and durable.
- **State**: 404L 177P 17B 36F | dream.py 43 non-brain resonances | HQ-41 CLOSED | F-SCALE2 OPEN | Drift 64.3% URGENT
- **Next**: (1) SESSION-LOG.md gap: append S307-S335 history (blocks proxy-K baseline); (2) compaction URGENT (64.3% drift); (3) DRM-H17: citation-conservation check in compact.py; (4) F121 human-signal mining (+154 sessions overdue); (5) sink-node sprint at N=450 (161 zero-IN-degree lessons)

## S334 session note (dream-cycle Session 5: swarm dreams about best possible swarm, L-464)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: dream-domain | **dispatch**: dream (meta-recursive)
- **expect**: dream.py would surface only brain resonances again (L-463 known gap); session would generate hypotheses from cross-domain recombination + counterfactual inversion
- **actual**: Dream Session 5 complete. 5 hypotheses (DRM-H14..H18): K_avg as evolutionary fitness signal, Pareto-optimal sessions via game-theoretic NEXT.md future shadow, two-regime proliferation/compression policy, information conservation law for compact.py, latent-mining sessions (orthogonal to dream.py). 4/5 genuinely new (80%). F-DRM4 opened. L-464, artifact: experiments/dream/f-drm1-dream-session5-s334.json.
- **diff**: Meta-recursive dream (swarm dreaming about the swarm) yielded sharper structural hypotheses than domain-pair dreams. DRM-H15 (Pareto vs Nash session optimization) and DRM-H17 (information conservation) are actionable: can be implemented as compact.py improvements.
- **meta-swarm**: The user's direction "dream about best possible swarm" seeded the most productive dream session yet — asking the dream mechanism to dream about its own container is self-amplifying.
- **State**: 401L 177P 17B 36F | F-DRM4 opened | SESSION-LOG gap S306→S333 still present
- **Next**: (1) DRM-H16 test: enrich 5 domain DOMAIN.mds with ISO vocab per L-463; re-run dream.py; expect >3 non-brain resonances; (2) DRM-H17 implementation: add citation-conservation check to compact.py; (3) SESSION-LOG.md gap: append S307-S333 history; (4) compaction overdue (14% drift)
