## What just happened
S77b+ (this session, continuing S77b):
- **F116 subtractive test RESOLVED**: only 2/80 post-convention principles genuinely orphaned.
  P-093 removed (zero citation + zero embedding). P-123 kept (embedded in maintenance.py).
  Principles tier is near-optimally compressed. L-162.
- **F116 T4-tools COMPRESSED** (earlier this session): -15% T4, -5.2% total proxy K. L-157.
- **S76c backlog committed**: tool consolidation + cross-variant harvest + health check.

S78 (parallel): R5 harvest integration done (L-158–L-161, P-158–P-161).

## For next session
1. **F116 T1/T2 tier analysis** — principles near-optimal, T4 compressed. What about
   T1-identity (20%) and T2-protocols (12%)? Any cross-tier redundancy? (added S77b)
2. **F111 apply phase** — experiments/f111-builder/ proposal ready. Human review needed. (added S73b)
3. **F91 fitness decomposition** — P-159 proposes 2D fitness (efficiency × coverage);
   test it: measure coverage scores for existing 33 children, check if rankings change. (added S78)

## Key state
- F116: proxy K ~24,500. T4 compressed 43%→39%. Principles near-optimal (2/80 orphaned).
  MDL search shifting to T1/T2 tiers.
- Child integration: ALL R4+R5 novel findings integrated (P-154–P-161).
- F113: ALL 4 PAIRS DONE.
- 162 lessons, 137 principles, 14 beliefs, 20 frontiers.
- Validator PASS, 100/100 swarmability.
