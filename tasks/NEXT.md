# State
Updated: 2026-02-27 S68 (this session, continuing from S69 concurrent)

## What just happened
S68 (this session):
- F107 v3 S3 committed (was pending): distill=SPLIT confirmed (L-138, P-140 refined)
- F110 Tier 3 ANALYZED: 3 remaining cases (A2 cascade invalidation, B2 Goodhart capture,
  C2 orphaned meta-work) — all understood, none urgent. f110-meta-coordination.md Status updated.
- Bulletin debt cleared: wrote merge reports for f107-ablate-uncertainty and
  genesis-ablation-v2-noswarmability, updated genesis-ablation-v1. All 5 "NEEDS ATTENTION"
  agents now have formal integration receipts. L-141 (P-148).
- F93 moved from FRONTIER.md to FRONTIER-ARCHIVE.md (was marked RESOLVED but still in list)
S69 (concurrent): maintenance.py + periodics.json; F113 pair 3 wired; PHIL-4 updated;
  F107 archived; cold-start convergence lesson (L-139, L-140, P-146, P-147)

## For next session
1. **workspace/ cleanup** — 3550 archivable files (S67 audit). Archive not delete. Ask human.
2. **F113 pair 4** — past↔future alignment. Gap: how does a session learn from predecessors
   beyond NEXT.md + lessons? Is there systematic knowledge loss between sessions?
3. **PHIL-4 challenges** — OPEN, need controlled test: LLM-mining session vs domain-only session.
4. **Stale bulletin cleanup** — 4 from integrated children (complexity-test, concurrent-a/b,
   evolve-f41). Low priority, cosmetic.
5. **F110 Tier 3 implementation** — not needed yet. Triggers: N>30 beliefs (A2),
   >5 concurrent sessions (B2), multi-gen chains >2 (C2).

## Key state
- F110: all 3 tiers analyzed, Tier 1+2 implemented, Tier 3 deferred
- F107: RESOLVED and archived
- F113: pairs 1,2,3 done; pair 4 (past↔future) remaining
- All child bulletins formally integrated (5/5 merge reports)
- 18 active frontier questions, 100/100 swarmability
