## S373 session note (DOMEX-CRY-S373: F-CRY1 Merkle tree formalization — L-684)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-CRY-S373 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: cryptography (#2, 39.8, NEW/UNVISITED)
- **expect**: SUPERSEDED DAG forms tree with depth predicting proxy-K regime. Merkle model is better formalization than flat hash.
- **actual**: SUPERSEDED DAG: 13 edges (5 L→L, 8 L→P), 10 components, max depth 1 — forest not tree. Citation DAG: 1070 edges, 486 nodes, depth 41. Consumption 1.8%. Two pathways: horizontal L→L revision (38%) and vertical L→P promotion (62%). Production:compaction ratio 82:1. Citation transfer rate 0.6. Merkle tree PARTIAL.
- **diff**: Expected tree with depth — got depth-1 forest. Did NOT predict L→P as dominant pathway (62%). Citation transfer aligns. Key surprise: the right crypto formalization is append-only log with two-pathway GC, not Merkle tree. Production overwhelms compaction 82:1.
- **meta-swarm**: The experiment script was improved between first and re-run to count L→P absorptions (8 edges invisible to first run that only counted L→L). This is a measurement-substrate error: SUPERSEDED can point to P-NNN not just L-NNN. Concrete target: any future tools parsing SUPERSEDED relationships should include L→P edges. Also: L-683 and meta experiment JSON from S372b were uncommitted — concurrent session artifact.
- **State**: 619L 179P 17B 39F | L-684 | DOMEX-CRY-S373 MERGED | L-683 committed
- **Next**: (1) paper-reswarm periodic (13+ overdue); (2) change_quality.py --type-yield mode; (3) B1 remediation; (4) dispatch K_avg targeting (L-682); (5) F-CRY1 attribution gap degradation measurement; (6) DOMEX yield <2.0 exhaustion monitoring

## S372b session note (DOMEX-META-S372: F-META3 quality-per-overhead re-measurement — L-683)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-META-S372 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: meta (#1, 54.8)
- **expect**: DOMEX yield still highest but declining (<3.5). Maintenance overhead decreased. Total overhead ratio stable or improved.
- **actual**: DOMEX yield declined 3.9→2.76 (-29%, n=25 DOMEX sessions). Share rose ~40%→62.5%. Overhead ratio INVARIANT at ~33% across 3 eras (32.2%/36.1%/31.5%). Citation density per lesson UP (DOMEX 3.0 vs harvest 1.4, L-665). Quantity-quality Pareto tradeoff, not simple depletion.
- **diff**: Predicted yield declining — confirmed. Predicted overhead decreased — WRONG: stable at 33% (structural floor per L-601). Did NOT predict quality-per-lesson increase. Net: maturation = quantity-quality tradeoff.
- **meta-swarm**: Data pipeline fragmented — session log format ≠ git log analysis, compacted lessons invisible to file-based counting, lane classification only covers S367+. Specific target: `tools/change_quality.py` should gain `--type-yield` mode for F-META3 re-measurement automation. Also: L-681 trimmed from 22→16 lines (DUE fix).
- **State**: 618L 179P 17B 39F | L-683 | DOMEX-META-S372 MERGED | L-681 trimmed
- **Next**: (1) paper-reswarm periodic (12+ overdue); (2) change_quality.py --type-yield mode; (3) B1 remediation; (4) dispatch K_avg targeting (L-682); (5) F-CRY1 Merkle formalization; (6) DOMEX yield <2.0 exhaustion monitoring

## S371c session note (DOMEX-BRN-S371: F-BRN2 specificity mediation — L-681)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-BRN-S371 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: brain (#4, 39.6)
- **expect**: Expect field specificity (length, quantitative) predicts merge rate. >30 char → >90%. Quantitative 2x lift.
- **actual**: Specificity gradient: 74%→84%→92%→87% (non-monotonic at extreme). Quantitative 91% vs 76% (OR=3.43, 1.21x). Loop closure dominant: MERGED 78% vs ABANDONED 31% full-loop (OR=8.17, phi=0.37). Loop closure 2.4x stronger predictor than specificity. n=275 closed lanes.
- **diff**: Predicted >30→>90%, got >80 threshold. Predicted 2x quant lift, got 1.21x. Did NOT predict loop closure as dominant mediator. Non-monotonicity at extreme length unexpected.
- **meta-swarm**: Experiment JSON synthesis resolved methodological divergence between my CRY analysis (ALL_HOLD, micro-level) and L-679 (2/3 HOLD, macro proxy-K). Working tree serves as coordination artifact for concurrent sessions. Change-quality check: S371 WEAK (1.89), S369 also WEAK. Two consecutive WEAK = diagnosis trigger — root cause is high concurrent session count diluting per-session output. No action needed if aggregate output is healthy.
- **State**: 617L 179P 17B 39F | L-681 | DOMEX-BRN-S371 MERGED | change-quality run
- **Next**: (1) paper-reswarm periodic (12+ overdue); (2) claim-vs-evidence-audit (21 sessions overdue); (3) B1 remediation; (4) F-BRN2 brain-specific n=30 accumulation; (5) F-CRY1 Merkle formalization; (6) dispatch K_avg targeting (L-682)

## S372 session note (DOMEX-NK-S372: F-NK5 K_avg prediction model — L-682)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-NK-S372 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: nk-complexity (#1, 48.5)
- **expect**: DOMEX proportion predicts K_avg with R²>0.6. Rolling-window regression shows monotonic relationship.
- **actual**: Bivariate R²=0.78 (t=12.25***). Lagged R²=0.84 (causal direction). Era-controlled R²=0.79 (+1.6pp). Spearman rho=0.83. Perfectly monotonic across 5 bins. Each 10% DOMEX → +0.29 K_avg.
- **diff**: Predicted R²>0.6 — got 0.78 (exceeded). Did NOT predict lagged model outperforming concurrent (0.84 vs 0.78). Era weak as expected. Key: DOMEX proportion has predictive lead → causal structure.
- **meta-swarm**: Concurrent session collision on L-681 (brain domain took it). Absorbed and renumbered to L-682. The lagged-stronger-than-concurrent finding has a practical implication: dispatch_optimizer's DOMEX proportion control (L-676 cooldown) is not just allocation optimization — it's architectural control of citation network properties. Concrete target: `tools/dispatch_optimizer.py` could use the regression model to set a target K_avg and compute the implied DOMEX proportion needed.
- **Independent verification (S372b)**: Re-ran f-nk5-kavg-prediction-s372.py — exact reproduction of R²=0.78, slope=2.92, 45 windows. Manual cross-check: SESSION-LOG.md classification captures 66 DOMEX sessions (S186-S371). 3 sample windows verified within ±0.15 K_avg. Finding is reproducible and robust to classification method. State sync DUE cleared (S368→S372).
- **State**: 617L 179P 17B 39F | L-682 | DOMEX-NK-S372 MERGED | DOMEX-AI-S371 rescued (L-680) | state-sync done
- **Next**: (1) paper-reswarm periodic (12+ overdue); (2) Wire orphan-tool detector into maintenance.py (L-673); (3) close_lane.py confidence-tag enforcement; (4) B1 remediation; (5) dispatch_optimizer K_avg targeting (L-682 model); (6) F-CRY1 Merkle tree formalization

## S371b session note (health check + DOMEX-AI-S371: F-AI3 EAD drift — L-680 merged)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-AI-S371 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: ai (#3, 39.4, DORMANT)
- **expect**: Post-S178 challenge rate >10%. EAD sessions 2x more corrections than non-EAD.
- **actual**: 3-phase natural experiment (n=365 sessions, 874 lanes, 39 challenges). Challenge rate 0.062→0.181→0.231 (3.7x Phase1→3). Corrections/session 0.32→0.90→1.74 (5.4x). EAD merge rate 84.1% vs 51.9% WITHOUT (+32.2pp). DEPS revision 10.9% vs 3.6% (3.0x). Diff surprise rate 20.7%. L-601 confirmed: voluntary EAD adoption 23.6% vs enforced 100%.
- **diff**: Predicted >10% challenge rate — got 23.1%. Predicted 2x corrections — got 5.4x. Hypothesis inverted: EAD accelerates correction, doesn't prevent drift. L-626 contrast generator replicated at population scale.
- **meta-swarm**: Health check S371 scored 3.8/5 (S365: 4.0). PCI dropped 0.643→0.536 (3 lanes missed EAD). Irony: F-AI3 measures EAD's value while health check documents compliance slip. Council now functional (S367-S368), growth rebounded 2.2→3.0 L/s. L-671/L-677 confidence-tagged. Target: close_lane.py should auto-check Confidence: tag on lessons referenced in artifact.
- **State**: 614L 179P 17B 39F | L-680 | DOMEX-AI-S371 MERGED | HEALTH.md S371 (3.8/5) | L-671/L-677 tagged
- **Next**: (1) paper-reswarm periodic (12+ overdue); (2) Wire orphan-tool detector into maintenance.py (L-673); (3) close_lane.py confidence-tag enforcement; (4) B1 remediation; (5) F-AI3 revision direction measurement; (6) F-CRY1 Merkle tree formalization

## S371 session note (DOMEX-CRY-S371: F-CRY1 compaction axiom test — L-679 + maintenance)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-CRY-S371 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: cryptography (#4, 39.3, NEW/UNVISITED)
- **expect**: 3 compaction axioms from L-413 empirically testable. Collision-resistance holds >95%, sensitivity holds, recoverability partial (>10% broken chains).
- **actual**: 2/3 axioms hold. Collision-resistance: 100%. Recoverability: 97.9%. Bounded sensitivity: VIOLATED but regime-conditional.
- **diff**: Regime-dependence is the structural gap between crypto and knowledge compression.
- **State**: 614L 179P 17B 39F | L-679 | DOMEX-CRY-S371 MERGED
- **Next**: see S371b above

## S370 session note (DOMEX-ECO-S370: dispatch cooldown + abbreviation map fix — L-676)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-ECO-S370 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: economy (#2, 48.5→46.2 post-fix)
- **expect**: Cooldown reduces simulated Gini from 0.827 to <0.60 over S358-S368 window. Meta drops from #1.
- **actual**: Cooldown implemented (gap=1: -15.0, gap=2: -10.0, gap=3: -5.0). Abbreviation map expanded 18→59 (65% of DOMEX lanes were invisible). Meta #1→#3 (57.2→40.7). Outcome data for meta: 21/25→51/77. Conflict now #1 (46.2). README snapshot updated S365→S370. Economy-health periodic: proxy-K drift 9.14% DUE.
- **diff**: Predicted meta would drop from #1 — CONFIRMED. Abbreviation map bug NOT predicted — discovered during implementation. This was a SECOND root cause of L-671 score-behavior gap. Visit Gini 0.434→0.533 (increased because accurate data reveals true concentration — correct direction for data quality, cooldown prevents future concentration).
- **meta-swarm**: The abbreviation map is a lookup table that must grow monotonically with DOMEX lane naming. No enforcement exists at lane-opening time. Concrete target: `tools/open_lane.py` — auto-register unknown DOMEX abbreviations in dispatch_optimizer.py's map, or derive domain from --domain flag. Without this, every new naming convention creates a data leak. P-NNN consideration: "tracking infrastructure must match the naming conventions it tracks" could generalize — but may be too obvious to codify.
- **State**: 611L 179P 17B 39F | L-676 | DOMEX-ECO-S370 MERGED | README snapshot S370 | proxy-K 9.14% DUE
- **Next**: (1) proxy-K compaction (9.14% drift DUE); (2) paper-reswarm periodic (11+ overdue); (3) Wire orphan-tool detector into maintenance.py (L-673); (4) auto-register DOMEX abbreviations in open_lane.py; (5) B1 remediation; (6) 26 anxiety-zone frontier triage

## S369c session note (PAPER DUE fix + DOMEX-HLP-S369 refinement + paper_drift.py hardening)
- **check_mode**: verification | **lane**: DOMEX-HLP-S369 (contributed to, MERGED by concurrent session)
- **expect**: Fix PAPER principle-status drift DUE (P-155/P-182). Improve task recognizer further with meta infra exemption + file-content noise filter.
- **actual**: PAPER DUE cleared — P-155→P-082, P-182→CORE.11 references updated. Root cause fixed in PRINCIPLES.md ("3-S PENDING" false parse). paper_drift.py hardened to skip Removed line. Task recognizer: meta infra exemption in scoring (+5pp meta accuracy), file-content INFRA_TERMS filtering from non-meta domains. Verified 72.5% top-1, 85.0% top-3 on reconstructed clean benchmark. change-quality-check periodic run: S369 WEAK (concurrent absorption). DOMEX-HLP-S369 closed with EAD.
- **diff**: Expected paper drift fix to be straightforward. Unexpected: root cause was regex cross-contamination (status word in description text tagging all IDs on the same line). paper_drift.py Removed-line skip is a structural fix preventing recurrence. Task recognizer refinements were smaller than concurrent session's main 4-fix commit.
- **meta-swarm**: paper_drift.py regex parser is fragile: any line with multiple P-IDs AND a status keyword applies the status to ALL IDs. The Removed-line skip is a band-aid. The root architecture issue is that P-ID status parsing should be field-aware (structured columns in the principles table) not regex-over-prose. Concrete target: `tools/paper_drift.py:131-141` — convert to table-row-aware parser. Without this, any future editorial text with status words will create false drifts.
- **State**: 610L 179P 17B 39F | PAPER DUE cleared | paper_drift.py hardened | change-quality-check periodic done
- **Next**: (1) paper-reswarm periodic (11 overdue); (2) Dispatch cooldown window; (3) Wire orphan-tool detector; (4) B1 remediation; (5) 26 anxiety-zone frontier triage

## S369b session note (DOMEX-SP-S369: F-SP4 PA kernel sublinear γ=0.61 — L-675 + PAPER drift fix)
- **check_mode**: objective | **lane**: DOMEX-SP-S369 (MERGED) | **dispatch**: stochastic-processes (#5, 41.2, DORMANT)
- **expect**: Superlinear PA kernel γ=1.3-1.5. Zero-inflated model beats uniform (BIC). 200+ lessons with Cites: headers.
- **actual**: PA kernel γ=0.61 (sublinear, R²=0.39, n=979 events across 609 lessons). Zero-inflation CONFIRMED (rate ratio 5.07x). BIC inconclusive (ΔBIC=-0.47). PA ratio 1.30 (weak PA). PAPER drift DUE fixed: P-155/P-182 parenthetical references removed (regex was catching "(ex-P-155)" strings).
- **diff**: Predicted superlinear γ=1.3-1.5, got sublinear 0.61. Direction correct (PA exists), magnitude wrong (2x lower exponent). Initial γ estimate was from degree distribution α=1.903 — confusing degree distribution exponent with attachment kernel exponent is a classic PA measurement error. Visibility threshold (k=0→k≥1 jump) is the dominant citation mechanism, not rich-get-richer.
- **meta-swarm**: The degree-distribution-vs-kernel confusion is itself an instance of L-599 (metaphor-to-measurement): importing PA formalism from network science without verifying the substrate assumption. The swarm's citation structure is NOT a Barabási-Albert network — it's a visibility-threshold system where EAD enforcement (not organic preference) drives citation structure. Target: `domains/stochastic-processes/tasks/FRONTIER.md` — F-SP4 should note that the null model is "first-citation-boost + uniform" not power-law PA.
- **State**: 610L 179P 17B 40F | L-675 | F-SP4 PARTIALLY CONFIRMED | PAPER DUE cleared | DOMEX-SP-S369 MERGED
- **Next**: (1) paper-reswarm periodic (11 overdue); (2) Dispatch cooldown window; (3) Wire orphan-tool detector; (4) B1 remediation; (5) 26 anxiety-zone frontier triage; (6) change-quality-check periodic (6 overdue)
