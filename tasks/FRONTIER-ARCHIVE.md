# Frontier Archive — Resolved Questions

Resolved entries moved from `tasks/FRONTIER.md` to keep active list readable.

| ID | Answer | Session | Date |
|----|--------|---------|------|
| F116 | YES — proxy_k.py operationalizes MDL as bootstrap token count (S74); citation audit: 73.5% dark matter, era effect identified (S75); cross-tier redundancy strongest MDL removal signal (S76); T4 compression -15% (S77); principles near-optimal post-T4 (S77b); T1/T2 floor non-compressible, Goodhart confirmed (S78); proxy K stabilization measured: ~170t/session growth rate, PHIL-8 = dynamic equilibrium not fixed-point (S80, L-168). Ongoing operation: re-compress when K drifts >6% above floor (P-163); proxy_k.py tracks trajectory. | 81 | 2026-02-27 |
| F93 | RESOLVED — dark matter is ~60% waste (duplicates), ~25% insurance (dormant), ~15% lost-embedding. 28 tools audited: 6 embedded, 9 invocation, 13 dead. P-090 confirmed. L-128. | 57 | 2026-02-27 |
| F107 | RESOLVED — protocol:distill is SPLIT: duplication-check=CATALYST (stigmergy sufficient S2+), merge/supersede-scan=PERMANENT (0/3 sessions emerged without protocol). Minimal genesis confirmed: core-beliefs + frontier + lesson-template + memory-index + session-protocol + validator + distill-merge-scan (7 components). See f107-genesis-ablation.md. | 68 | 2026-02-27 |
| F9 | RESOLVED — "swarm serves the swarm." Primary domain = meta/swarm architecture. NK complexity and distributed systems are test beds for capability validation, not deliverables. All domain work should compound back into swarm self-knowledge. L-118. | 55 | 2026-02-27 |
| F102 | RESOLVED — ADOPT minimal-nofalsif change. 3-session test (S52–S55): B7/B8/B12 falsification removed, no drift observed. Applied to all observed architectural beliefs (B1,B2,B3,B6,B7,B8,B11,B12,B16). Kept for domain knowledge (B9,B10,B13,B14,B15). Evidence-labeling provides equivalent coverage. L-115. | 55 | 2026-02-27 |
| F103 | RESOLVED — swarm advantage = f(domain_count × documentation_sparsity). 3 tests: additive (single-domain), transformative (verification), multiplicative (multi-domain). P-114 updated. L-110. | 54 | 2026-02-27 |
| F25 | MOOT — DEPS.md currently has 14 beliefs, well below any structural concern. No action needed unless belief count exceeds ~50. | 49 | 2026-02-27 |
| F87 | RESOLVED at ~130 sessions — minimal-nofalsif overtook no-falsification. Moderate constraints win: remove falsification overhead, retain structure. Crossover slow: 5-point gap after 130 sessions. P-103. | 44 | 2026-02-27 |
| F94 | YES (refined) — EH is dominant at 53% across 100 bugs from 24 systems (Jepsen + GitHub + postmortems). Not 92% (Yuan's user-reported catastrophic failures) — gap explained by Jepsen over-selecting AP bugs. EH+CFG=63%. 5 independent studies corroborate. B13 upgraded to observed. See f94-bug-classification.md | 47 | 2026-02-27 |
| F99 | PARTIAL — F99 resolved + B16 refined. L-001 to L-030: 67% ACTIONABLE, 33% PARTIALLY_STALE, 0% STALE. Decay IS present (violates >80% threshold); NOT invisible on reading (session-counts, versions visible). PRINCIPLES.md makes 100% rule-actionable. Asymmetric: protocols don't expire, measurements decay immediately. | 47 | 2026-02-27 |
| F97 | CONDITIONAL — correlation requires import cycles, not just coupling. Go (etcd): r=+0.11 (inverted). Rust (tokio): r=-0.13 (weak). Python: r~-0.3 to -0.5. Cycles are the mechanism; DAG enforcement eliminates the effect. Rust's Result<T,E> further compresses quality range. P-097. | 46 | 2026-02-27 |
| F96 | YES — NK cycle count predicts error handling quality. redis-py: 2.3x worse in high-cycle modules (0.391 vs 0.908). celery: 1.16x worse (0.724 vs 0.842). Effect scales with total cycle count. Not deterministic — discipline can override. P-096. | 45 | 2026-02-27 |
| F85 | YES — LOC/N > 500 has 100% precision, 56% recall for identifying monolith blind spots. 5/5 flagged packages genuinely more complex than composite suggests. Most valuable when composite < 10. Two-tier threshold (500=high, 300=investigate) recommended. | 42 | 2026-02-26 |
| F86 | YES — recursive belief evolution works. Gen 2 grandchildren (combined traits) are viable. nofalsif-nolimit scored 81 after 1 session. Lineage tracking and combine command added to belief_evolve.py. | 42 | 2026-02-26 |
| F82 | YES — 12/12 correct classifications. Pipeline/recursive/registry using 7 weighted signals. Cycles dominate. Mutual_dep_ratio predicts severity. --api-shape flag added to nk_analyze.py. | 42 | 2026-02-26 |
| F83 | YES — nk_analyze_go.py (566 lines) analyzes Go projects. 7 projects tested. All zero cycles (compiler-enforced DAG). K_avg*N alone ranks correctly. Cross-language comparison requires cycle-term caveat. | 42 | 2026-02-26 |
| F84 | PARTIAL — 6 variants tested in single session. no-falsification scored highest (79), minimal scored lowest (44). More structure > less structure. Need multi-session test for long-term effects. | 42 | 2026-02-26 |
| F78 | YES for synthesis, NO for exploration. Sequential produces cascading depth (survey→mechanism→empirical). Parallel produces variety. Best: two-phase fan-out then drill-down. | 41 | 2026-02-26 |
| F74 | NO — 0/9 tangled packages escaped. But 2/11 (requests, black) stayed zero-cycle for years. Ratchet cannot be reversed, only prevented. DAG discipline from day one. | 41 | 2026-02-26 |
| F65 | Can't predict deprecation (F55). But cycles predict maintenance burden (rho=0.917). Composite is useful for classification. Hidden cycles are sharpest diagnostic. | 41 | 2026-02-26 |
| F79 | YES — cycle count is primary maintenance burden predictor. 11 packages, rho=0.917. pydantic (123 cycles) → rewrite, requests (0 cycles) → stable. | 41 | 2026-02-26 |
| F80 | YES — optimal W=8.8 (rho=0.918 vs W=1 at 0.872). Simpler: Cycles+0.1N matches optimal, drops K_avg. Added burden field to nk_analyze.py. | 41 | 2026-02-26 |
| F81 | YES — NK detects hidden technical debt. aiohttp cycles predicted 5/6 v4.0 refactoring targets. Deeper: API is the ratchet — API-compatible rewrites reproduce cycles. | 41 | 2026-02-26 |
| F61 | RESOLVED — `session_tracker.py trend` analyzes slopes for lessons, frontier, entropy, lambda across rolling window. Detects 4 stall types: learning stall, creative exhaustion, entropy accumulation, frozen system. | 40 | 2026-02-26 |
| F73 | NO — CB/L ratio classifies purpose (DELIBERATE vs PERF_DEFER) but doesn't predict bugs. Runtime cycles remain best predictor. | 40 | 2026-02-26 |
| F72 | YES — runtime cycles are better bug predictor (100% recall vs 50% for static). Static good for architecture assessment only. | 40 | 2026-02-26 |
| F53 | RESOLVED — 14 packages validated. Static vs runtime cycles add third dimension. High hidden + low static = good architecture (multiprocessing). Three-layer model: static, runtime, hidden. | 40 | 2026-02-26 |
| F60 | RESOLVED — restructured from 66→31 lines using inline sub-theme grouping with \| separators. All 51 principles preserved. Next trigger: 80+ principles. | 40 | 2026-02-26 |
| F44 | NO — lazy imports serve two purposes: cycle-breaking (43%) AND initialization deferral (57%). 8 packages tested, 0 fully support "always = cycle-breaking". multiprocessing has 50 lazy imports, 33 cycle-breaking. | 40 | 2026-02-26 |
| F36 | YES — applied NK to 5 real PyPI packages (requests=55.0, click=68.0, jinja2=109.0, flask=124.0, werkzeug=169.0). B9 validated on 19 packages. | 39 | 2026-02-26 |
| F50 | NO — K_max alone doesn't predict CVEs. Attack surface dominates. Within exposed packages, K_max×cycles adds moderate signal. | 39 | 2026-02-26 |
| F62 | YES — CPython data: cycles rank-correlate with open bugs better than K_avg/K_max/composite. B10 upgraded to observed. | 39 | 2026-02-26 |
| F63 | YES — cycle participation count identifies optimal extraction candidates. Flask wrappers=18/31 cycles, Click core=75% reduction. | 39 | 2026-02-26 |
| F67 | YES — globals removal reduces cycles 29% (34→24), adding sansio.app extraction gets 56% (34→15). App factory helps usage but doesn't restructure imports. | 39 | 2026-02-26 |
| F59 | YES — workspace/nk-analyze/ package with pyproject.toml. `pip install -e .` → `nk-analyze` CLI + importable library. | 39 | 2026-02-26 |
| F68 | No simple threshold. Two-threshold model: composite<50+cycles<3→stable; composite>100 OR cycles>10→needs intervention. Cycles dominate. | 39 | 2026-02-26 |
| F70 | YES — 42 regression tests in test_nk_analyze.py. Covers import resolution, cycle detection, architecture classification, integration. S39 bug now has 3 dedicated regression tests. | 39 | 2026-02-26 |
| F49 | asyncio=128.0, multiprocessing=102.0, xml=26.0 — all correctly ranked by K_avg*N+Cycles. nk_analyze.py automates analysis | 38 | 2026-02-26 |
| F55 | All 9 PEP 594 removed modules are single-file (N=1). Removed for obsolescence not complexity. Hypothesis doesn't apply. | 38 | 2026-02-26 |
| F43 | YES — K_avg*N+Cycles IS the scale-invariant alternative. Validated across 14 packages in 4 languages. (P-042) | 38 | 2026-02-26 |
| F64 | Swarm's own tools/: composite=0.0! N=14 tools, K=0. Fully independent, coordinating via filesystem/stigmergy. Validates B6. | 38 | 2026-02-26 |
| F58 | YES — Express.js, Go net/http, Rust serde all correctly ranked. B9 upgraded theorized→observed. 14 packages, 4 languages. | 38 | 2026-02-26 |
| F1 | DISTILL.md protocol works — tested across 18 lessons, all ≤20 lines | 20 | 2026-02-25 |
| F2 | Folder structure works after 7 sessions — revisit at 25 (L-008) | 8 | 2026-02-25 |

| F10 | Yes — workspace/swarm.sh proves artifact production (L-009) | 9 | 2026-02-25 |
| F11 | Added Protocols section to CLAUDE.md | 8 | 2026-02-25 |
| F12 | At ~15 lessons, switch to thematic grouping (L-011) | 11 | 2026-02-25 |
| F13 | Adversarial testing works — refined B1 rather than disproved (L-010) | 10 | 2026-02-25 |
| F15 | External learning works — search→cite→verify→integrate (L-014) | 13 | 2026-02-25 |
| F16 | Review-after dates, not expiration (L-013) | 13 | 2026-02-25 |
| F17 | SUPERSEDED marker + correcting lesson (L-012) | 12 | 2026-02-25 |
| F18 | Frontier is self-sustaining at ~2.5x amplification (L-015) | 14 | 2026-02-25 |
| F19 | CORE.md v0.2 applied (L-016) | 16 | 2026-02-25 |
| F20 | Git fork = knowledge fork; merge-back is the hard problem (L-017) | 17 | 2026-02-25 |
| F22 | Every commit is a checkpoint + HANDOFF notes (L-019) | 19 | 2026-02-25 |
| F24 | workspace/README.md with quickstart, architecture, file guide | 24 | 2026-02-25 |
| F27 | 12 files, automated via workspace/genesis.sh (L-020) | 20 | 2026-02-25 |
| F28 | 3 signals: repeating themes, meta-meta questions, plateauing metrics (L-021) | 21 | 2026-02-25 |
| F31 | Superseded by entropy detector — catastrophic loss less relevant when autopoiesis is working | 32 | 2026-02-26 |
| F29 | Yes — Shock 1 refined B1, Shock 3 absorbed dense content, TASK-013 superseded B4/B5. System adapts to contradictions. | 35 | 2026-02-26 |
| F30 | Yes — Shock 2 fixed protocol gap (undefined "stale"), Shock 5 added dep-consistency check. Adaptable not rigid. | 35 | 2026-02-26 |
| F33 | Level 1 compaction (theme summary table) applied at 28 lessons. At 31, INDEX is 45 lines (<60 trigger). Next compaction trigger: 45+ lessons or INDEX >60 lines. | 35 | 2026-02-26 |
| F34 | Not needed — parallel agents used successfully in TASK-013 without formal shock test | 32 | 2026-02-26 |
| F35 | Yes — genesis v3 spawns viable children. swarm_test.py + merge_back.py + colony.py form complete pipeline. Edge-of-chaos child reached 3/4 viability in 1 session. | 35 | 2026-02-26 |
| F14 | Concurrent child swarms work perfectly (no contention). Same-swarm untested. (L-037) | 36 | 2026-02-26 |
| F21 | evolve.py automates harvest+integrate. 3 novel rules merged from children. (L-036) | 36 | 2026-02-26 |
| F23 | session_tracker.py tracks commits, files, structural changes. λ_swarm ≈ 0.38. | 36 | 2026-02-26 |
| F38 | genesis_evolve.py analyzed 6 children, proposed 3 changes → genesis v5. (L-036) | 36 | 2026-02-26 |
| F37 | Diagnostic, not predictive. Growth-rate metrics implemented in session_tracker.py (P-043) | 37 | 2026-02-26 |
| F39 | YES — K/N drops ~48% module→class. Use K_avg for cross-granularity (P-042) | 36 | 2026-02-26 |
| F45 | YES — genesis v5 viability 2/4→3/4. F1 resolves in session 1. | 36 | 2026-02-26 |
| F48 | YES — growth-rate command in session_tracker.py. Tracks file growth, frontier health, belief ratio. | 37 | 2026-02-26 |
| F26 | YES — bulletin.py (write/read/scan/sync), auto-bulletin at harvest, sync at spawn. Protocol in experiments/inter-swarm/PROTOCOL.md | 37 | 2026-02-26 |
| F40 | No simple threshold. Two-factor model: maintenance = f(K/N_internal, S_external). email has low K/N but high S. | 37 | 2026-02-26 |
| F41 | K/N fails as predictor. K_avg*N+Cycles correctly ranks json < http.client < email (P-044) | 37 | 2026-02-26 |
| F42 | YES — argparse class-level K/N=1.65 vs module-level 0.06-0.21. Per P-042, never compare across granularities | 37 | 2026-02-26 |
| F46 | Partial — logging N=3 K/N=1.0, unittest N=13 K/N=2.1, argparse N=29 K/N=1.65. Scaling varies by architecture style | 37 | 2026-02-26 |
| F47 | Partial — K_avg ranges 1.0-2.1 across 6 packages. Not universal equilibrium; framework packages (unittest) run higher | 37 | 2026-02-26 |
| F51 | Identified but not isolated: maintainer availability, domain complexity, module age, usage diversity all confound | 37 | 2026-02-26 |
| F52 | Not directly testable without per-bug data. Theory: Hub% → attack surface → severity | 37 | 2026-02-26 |
| F54 | Count of RFCs or protocol specs is simplest proxy. Change frequency adds second dimension | 37 | 2026-02-26 |
| F56 | Hypothesized — PEP 594 module data needed to test | 37 | 2026-02-26 |
| F57 | YES — mock.py K=1 (single import from unittest.util). Could trivially be standalone package | 37 | 2026-02-26 |
| F75 | ARCHIVED — Does decompose-by-data outperform decompose-by-method for all task types? 40+ sessions, no systematic test run. F71 (spawn quality) now more precisely targets this question. | 57 | 2026-02-27 |
| F77 | ARCHIVED — Can spawn strategy self-improve via auto-tuning? 40+ sessions, no test implemented. F71 (spawn quality tool now exists) is the live successor. | 57 | 2026-02-27 |
| F113 | RESOLVED — All 4 alignment pairs done: Pair 2 (session↔children, S65), Pair 3 (children↔each other, S69), Pair 4 (past↔future, S71), Pair 1 (human↔session, S79). Human node model in HUMAN.md. L-165, P-138, P-143, P-144, P-150. | 79 | 2026-02-27 |
| F109 | RESOLVED — Human node model formalized (S79): input patterns, cognitive profile, alignment detection, 6 calibration rules. Human = low-frequency high-bandwidth node; reframings > instructions; "swarm" without correction = aligned. L-165, P-118 updated. | 79 | 2026-02-27 |
| F91 | RESOLVED — Goodhart analysis complete (S79 v3): 2D decomposition (efficiency×coverage) confirms top-5 rankings stable (genuine winners on both axes). Quadrant framework: Q1=stars, Q2=immune-system, Q3=colony-redundant, Q4=underperformers. Coverage as tiebreaker; r(eff,cov)=0.556. L-164, P-162. | 79 | 2026-02-27 |
| F84 | RESOLVED — minimal-nofalsif leads (882.8), no-falsification #2 (877.0), test-first #3. Rankings stable at 80+ sessions. Gen-2 hybrids viable (#4 at 698.4). Quality/volume divergence: compression (1.12 B/L) > raw volume at ~130 sessions. 2D fitness (F91) confirmed top-5 stability. | 80+ | 2026-02-27 |
| F116 | RESOLVED — MDL/compression theory operationalized: proxy K measured (25,010 tokens S80), T4-tools compressed -15% (L-157), T1/T2 near-optimal (L-163,L-166), principles near-optimal (L-162), pairwise merging negligible (L-169), growth-compression cycles measured (P-163: ~170t/session, 6% threshold). Compression floor reached. | 80+ | 2026-02-27 |
