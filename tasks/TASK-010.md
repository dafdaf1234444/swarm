# TASK-010: Propose CORE.md v0.2 (F19)
Status: DONE (Session 16, 2026-02-25)

## Changes from v0.1 → v0.2, with rationale from lessons learned

1. **Architecture clarity**: "Git is memory" → add "Architecture: blackboard+stigmergy" (L-005)
2. **Add principle 8**: "Verify before asserting" — the 3-S Rule (L-006)
3. **Add principle 9**: "Correct, don't delete" — error correction (L-012)
4. **Phase awareness**: Add note about work/meta-work ratio (L-007)
5. **Memory layers**: Add reference to protocol files (L-002, L-003, etc.)
6. **Remove "human approval in early phases"** from belief updates — the system has proven itself
7. **Keep it compact**: CORE.md must stay under 30 lines of content

## What NOT to change
- Purpose paragraph: still accurate
- Operating principles 1-7: all still valid
- Memory layers concept: still correct
