# TASK-002: Solve F1 — reliable session distillation into ≤20 lines
Status: DONE (Session 2, 2026-02-25)

## Do this
1. Analyze L-001 as the first real distillation — what worked, what's missing?
2. Propose a distillation protocol (checklist a session runs at the end)
3. Refine TEMPLATE.md if needed
4. Write the protocol to a new file
5. Write a lesson about what we learned about distillation

## Key question
The problem isn't "can you write 20 lines" — it's "do those 20 lines capture the right things?"
Signal: what would a future session NEED to know? Noise: session-specific mechanics.

## Done when
- A distillation protocol exists that any session can follow
- TEMPLATE.md is refined if needed
- F1 has a resolution or a refined next step
