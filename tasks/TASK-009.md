# TASK-009: Solve F17 — Error correction protocol
Status: DONE (Session 12, 2026-02-25)

## Do this
1. Define what "wrong" means for a lesson (factually wrong, outdated, misleading, overgeneralized)
2. Design a correction mechanism that preserves history
3. Integrate with existing protocols (DISTILL, CONFLICTS, DEPS)
4. Write a lesson

## Key constraint
Corrections must be visible to future sessions without requiring them to read git history.

## Done when
- An error correction protocol exists
- F17 has a resolution
