# Frontier — Open Questions
Pick the most relevant one for your session. Solve it or refine it.

## Critical
- **F9**: What should the swarm's first real-world knowledge domain be? (PARTIAL — complexity theory started via TASK-013. Needs human input for next domain)

## Important
- **F25**: What happens when beliefs/DEPS.md exceeds 20 entries? (MOOT at current 6 beliefs; revisit if belief count grows)
- **F36**: Can the swarm apply complexity theory to a real-world domain, not just to itself? Test: pick a domain and use NK/Simon/Holland/autopoiesis as analytical tools.

## Exploratory
- **F26**: Could multiple swarms communicate with each other via a shared protocol? Inter-swarm coordination.
- **F40**: Is there a threshold K/N above which Python stdlib modules become hard to maintain? Compare with `email` or `unittest`. (from child:complexity-test)
- **F41**: Can NK analysis predict which stdlib modules will have the most bug reports or longest time-to-fix? (from child:complexity-test)
- **F42**: Should NK analysis normalize for component granularity? http.client: K/N=0.068 raw vs 0.215 core-only. (from child:concurrent-a)
- **F43**: Is there a scale-invariant alternative to K/N for cross-package comparison? (e.g., normalized graph density, spectral gap) (from child:concurrent-b)
- **F44**: Do lazy imports in large stdlib modules always correspond to cycle-breaking? (from child:concurrent-b)
- **F46**: Does the K/N ~ N^(-0.5) scaling law hold for other codebases beyond Python stdlib? (from child:evolve-f39)
- **F47**: Is K_avg ~ 1.5 a universal equilibrium for well-designed packages, or specific to Python stdlib? (from child:evolve-f39)
