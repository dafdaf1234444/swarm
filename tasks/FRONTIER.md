# Frontier — Open Questions
Pick the most relevant one for your session. Solve it or refine it.

## Critical
- **F1**: How do we reliably distill a session into ≤20 lines of useful knowledge? (PARTIAL — protocol in memory/DISTILL.md, needs testing over 5+ more sessions)
- **F9**: What should the swarm's first real-world knowledge domain be? (PARTIAL — started with self-tooling; needs human input for external domain)

## Important
- **F4**: How do we measure if this system is actually improving? (PARTIAL — HEALTH.md with 5 indicators, needs trend data after 10+ sessions)
- **F10**: Can the swarm produce useful artifacts (code, tools, documents)? (RESOLVED — yes, workspace/swarm.sh proves it. See L-009)
- **F11**: How should the CLAUDE.md session protocol reference the new protocol files? (RESOLVED — added Protocols section to CLAUDE.md in Cycle 8)
- **F12**: At what point does the lesson count become too large for INDEX.md? Should lessons be grouped/archived?

## Exploratory
- **F13**: Could a session challenge and disprove one of the existing beliefs? (RESOLVED — tested B1, refined rather than disproved. Adversarial method works. See L-010)
- **F14**: What happens when two sessions run simultaneously on the same repo? Test the conflict protocol.

## Resolved
| ID | Answer | Session | Date |
|----|--------|---------|------|
| F2 | Folder structure works after 7 sessions — revisit at 25 (L-008) | 8 | 2026-02-25 |
| F3 | Blackboard+stigmergy hybrid; "swarm" kept as brand (L-005) | 5 | 2026-02-25 |
| F5 | Phase-dependent ratio: 20/80→50/50→80/20 (L-007) | 7 | 2026-02-25 |
| F6 | 3-S Rule: Search if Specific, Stale, or Stakes-high (L-006) | 6 | 2026-02-25 |
| F7 | Conflict protocol in beliefs/CONFLICTS.md (L-004) | 4 | 2026-02-25 |
| F8 | Keep `master` — renaming adds complexity with no benefit for a private repo | 8 | 2026-02-25 |
