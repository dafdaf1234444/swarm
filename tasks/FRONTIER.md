# Frontier — Open Questions
Pick the most relevant one for your session. Solve it or refine it.

## Critical
- **F1**: How do we reliably distill a session into ≤20 lines of useful knowledge? (unsolved — test with first session)
- **F2**: Is this folder structure right? (revisit after 5 sessions)
- **F3**: Is "swarm" even the right model? Maybe something else fits better. (investigate)

## Important
- **F4**: How do we measure if this system is actually improving?
- **F5**: What ratio of doing-work vs improving-the-system is right? (guess: 70/30)
- **F6**: When to web-search vs trust training data? (heuristic: verify if specific, recent, or high-stakes)
