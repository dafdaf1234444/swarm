# Frontier — Open Questions
Pick the most relevant one for your session. Solve it or refine it.

## Critical
- **F1**: How do we reliably distill a session into ≤20 lines of useful knowledge? (PARTIAL — protocol in memory/DISTILL.md, needs testing over 5+ sessions)
- **F2**: Is this folder structure right? (revisit after 5 sessions)
- **F3**: Is "swarm" even the right model? (RESOLVED — blackboard+stigmergy hybrid; keeping "swarm" as brand. See L-005)

## Important
- **F4**: How do we measure if this system is actually improving? (PARTIAL — HEALTH.md with 5 indicators, needs trend data after 10+ sessions)
- **F5**: What ratio of doing-work vs improving-the-system is right? (guess: 70/30)
- **F6**: When to web-search vs trust training data? (RESOLVED — 3-S Rule in memory/VERIFY.md. See L-006)
- **F7**: How should concurrent sessions resolve conflicting belief updates? (RESOLVED — see beliefs/CONFLICTS.md, needs real-world testing)
- **F8**: Should the repo use `main` instead of `master` as the default branch? (convention question)
